            "We have discovered a positive unidirectional exchange anisotropy in antiferromagnetic (Fe F 2) and ferromagnetic (Fe) bilayers cooled through the antiferromagnetic critical temperature T N in large magnetic fields. For low positive cooling fields, the ferromagnet's magnetization (M\u2212 H) loop center shifts to negative fields, as is normally observed in other systems. In contrast, large cooling fields can cause the shift to be positive. This can be explained if the Fe F 2 surface spins couple to the external magnetic cooling field above T N and the Fe F 2-Fe interaction is antiferromagnetic.",

A device scale on-chip heater is deposited on a bilayer of MnF 2 (110)(30 nm)\/Pt (4 nm) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a MgF 2 (110) substrate. Using Pt as a spin detector layer, it is possible to measure the thermally generated spin current from MnF 2 through the inverse spin Hall effect. The low temperature (2\u201380 K) and high magnetic field (up to 140 kOe) regime is explored. A clear spin-flop transition corresponding to the sudden rotation of antiferromagnetic spins out of the easy axis is observed in the spin Seebeck signal when large magnetic fields (> 9 T) are applied parallel to the easy axis of the MnF 2 thin film. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the easy axis, the spin-flop transition is absent, as expected.",

The exchange bias depends very strongly on the crystalline orientation of the antiferromagnet for both films and crystals. However, the interface roughness seems to have a strong effect mainly on the film systems. These results indicate that the exchange bias depends strongly on the spin structure at the interface, especially on the angle between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spins. We have also found a strong dependence of the hysteresis loops shape on the cooling field direction with respect to the antiferromagnetic anisotropy axis, induced by a rotation of the ferromagnetic easy axis as the sample is cooled through T N. For the single crystal systems the results imply the existence of a perpendicular coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spins \u2026",

The behavior of the hysteresis loops of the Fe above and below the N\u00e9el temperature TN of FeF2 indicates a 90\u00b0 rotation of the ferromagnetic easy axis due to the antiferromagnetic ordering. By examining the Fe hysteresis loops together with the FeF2 susceptibility behavior we infer that below TN the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spins are coupled perpendicular to each other. This behavior can be explained by recent micromagnetic calculations on exchange bias systems, or by magnetoelastic effects.",

            "By using the surface and element specificity of soft x-ray magnetic dichroism we provide direct experimental evidence for two different types of interfacial uncompensated Fe moments in exchange biased Co\/FeF 2 bilayers. Some moments are pinned and coupled antiparallel to the ferromagnet (FM). They give rise to a positive exchange bias and vanish above T N= 78 K together with the antiferromagnet (AF) order. Other interfacial Fe moments are unpinned and coupled parallel to the FM. They persist up to 300 K and give rise to magnetic order at the AF surface even above T N.",

            "The exchange bias and magnetic anisotropies in a Co layer on a single-crystalline F e F 2 film have been determined between 30 and 300 K. By postulating that the coupling between the ferromagnet and the antiferromagnet persists above the N\u00e9el temperature (T N) we develop a model that quantitatively describes the exchange bias and the anisotropies over the whole temperature range, both above and below T N. Using only the measured low temperature exchange bias and a distribution of blocking temperatures we explain (i) the temperature dependence of the bias,(ii) the magnitude of the anisotropies,(iii) the opposite sign of the first and second order anisotropies,(iv) the observed 1\/T and 1\/T 3 temperature dependencies of the first and second order uniaxial anisotropies above T N, and (v) the decrease of the anisotropies below T N.",
