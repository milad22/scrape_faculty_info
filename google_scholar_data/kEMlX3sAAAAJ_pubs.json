Understanding and controlling the phononic properties of materials provides opportunities to thermally insulate buildings, reduce environmental noise, transform waste heat into electricity and develop earthquake protection. Here I review recent progress and the development of new ideas and devices that make use of phononic properties to control both sound and heat. Advances in sonic and thermal diodes, optomechanical crystals, acoustic and thermal cloaking, hypersonic phononic crystals, thermoelectrics, and thermocrystals herald the next technological revolution in phononics.",

A stationary spatial variation of intensity is created by the interference of two or more beams of light. The pattern that emerges out of the intensity distribution is transferred to a light sensitive medium, such as a photoresist, and after development yields a 3D bicontinuous photoresist\/air structure. Importantly, by a proper choice of beam parameters one can control the geometrical elements and volume fraction of the structures. This article provides an overview of the fabrication of 3D structures via IL (e.g., the formation of interference patterns, their dependence on beam parameters and several requirements for the photoresist) and highlights some of our recent efforts in the applications of these 3D structures in photonic crystals, phononic crystals and as microframes \u2026",
