            "Recent demonstrations of magnetization switching induced by in-plane current in heavy metal\/ferromagnetic heterostructures (HMFHs) have drawn great attention to spin torques arising from large spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC). Given the intrinsic strong SOC, topological insulators (TIs) are expected to be promising candidates for exploring spin\u2013orbit torque (SOT)-related physics. Here we demonstrate experimentally the magnetization switching through giant SOT induced by an in-plane current in a chromium-doped TI bilayer heterostructure. The critical current density required for switching is below 8.9\u00d7 10 4 A cm\u2212 2 at 1.9 K. Moreover, the SOT is calibrated by measuring the effective spin\u2013orbit field using second-harmonic methods. The effective field to current ratio and the spin-Hall angle tangent are almost three orders of magnitude larger than those reported for HMFHs. The giant SOT and efficient current-induced \u2026",

The switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetization is of particular technological relevance. However, in such materials, the presence of an in-plane external magnetic field is typically required to assist spin\u2013orbit torque-driven switching and this is an obstacle for practical applications. Here, we report the switching of out-of-plane magnetized Ta\/Co 20 Fe 60 B 20\/TaO x structures by spin\u2013orbit torques driven by in-plane currents, without the need for any external magnetic fields. This is achieved by introducing a lateral structural asymmetry into our devices, which gives rise to a new field-like spin\u2013orbit torque when in-plane current flows in these structures.

Landau-Lifshitz and magnetocircuit theories are used to directly relate spin current in different parts of the heterostructure to the spin-mixing conductances characterizing the antiferromagnet| metal interfaces and the antiferromagnet bulk damping parameters, quantities all obtainable from experiments.
