            "The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available 1. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor \u2026",

The endothermic heat of phase separation, which is related to the breaking of hydrogen bonds between water molecules surrounding hydrophobic moieties on the polymer, was a linear, decreasing function of the LCST. This suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between polymer side groups, which are the major driving force for phase separation, are enhanced at elevated temperatures due to a decrease in the structuring of water around hydrophobic side groups.

The zT of bulk alloys can be improved by reducing lattice thermal conductivity through grain boundary and point-defect scattering, which target low- and high-frequency phonons. Dense dislocation arrays formed at low-energy grain boundaries by liquid-phase compaction in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (bismuth antimony telluride) effectively scatter midfrequency phonons, leading to a substantially lower lattice thermal conductivity. Full-spectrum phonon scattering with minimal charge-carrier scattering dramatically improved the zT to 1.86 \u00b1 0.15 at 320 kelvin (K). Further, a thermoelectric cooler confirmed the performance with a maximum temperature difference of 81 K, which is much higher than current commercial Peltier cooling devices.",

            "Enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient (S) without reducing the electrical conductivity (\u03c3) is essential to realize practical thermoelectric materials exhibiting a dimensionless figure of merit (Z T= S 2\u00b7 \u03c3\u00b7 T\u00b7 \u03ba\u2212 1) exceeding 2, where T is the absolute temperature and \u03ba is the thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that a high-density two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined within a unit cell layer thickness in SrTiO 3 yields unusually large| S|, approximately five times larger than that of SrTiO 3 bulks, while maintaining a high \u03c3 2DEG. In the best case, we observe| S|= 850 \u03bcV K\u2212 1 and \u03c3 2DEG= 1.4\u00d7 10 3 S cm\u2212 1. In addition, by using the \u03ba of bulk single-crystal SrTiO 3 at room temperature, we estimate ZT\u223c 2.4 for the 2DEG, corresponding to ZT\u223c 0.24 for a complete device having the 2DEG as the active region. The present approach using a 2DEG provides a new route to realize practical thermoelectric \u2026",

            "Purpose: Although microRNAs have recently been recognized as riboregulators of gene expression, little is known about microRNA expression profiles in serous ovarian carcinoma. We assessed the expression of microRNA and the association between microRNA expression and the prognosis of serous ovarian carcinoma.Experimental Design: Twenty patients diagnosed with serous ovarian carcinoma and eight patients treated for benign uterine disease between December 2000 and September 2003 were enrolled in this study. The microRNA expression profiles were examined using DNA microarray and Northern blot analyses.Results: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients.
