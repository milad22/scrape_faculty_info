            "A search for the bb\u00af decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson is performed with the ATLAS experiment using the full dataset recorded at the LHC in Run 1.

            "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton\u2013proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s\u221a=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson, for  20\u2264pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |\u03b7|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |\u03b7|<1.2 ) for jets with  55\u2264pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |\u03b7|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating \u2026",

            "This paper presents the application of a variety of techniques to study jet substructure. The performance of various modified jet algorithms, or jet grooming techniques, for several jet types and event topologies is investigated for jets with transverse momentum larger than 300 GeV. Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects. Studies of the expected discrimination power of jet mass and jet substructure observables in searches for new physics are also presented. Event samples enriched in boosted W and Z bosons and top-quark pairs are used to study both the individual jet invariant mass scales and the efficacy of algorithms to tag boosted hadronic objects.

Measurements in electron-pair and muon-pair final states are corrected for detector effects and combined. Compared to previous measurements in proton\u0393\u00c7\u00f4proton collisions at \u252c\u00e1TeV, these new measurements benefit from a larger data sample and improved control of systematic uncertainties. Measurements are performed in bins of lepton-pair mass above, around and below the Z-boson mass peak. The data are compared to predictions from perturbative and resummed QCD calculations. For values of  the predictions from the Monte Carlo generator ResBos are generally consistent with the data within the theoretical uncertainties. However, at larger values of  this is not the case.

            "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of jet substructure techniques to identify the hadronic decays of boosted heavy particles. These studies all rely upon the assumption that the internal substructure of jets generated by QCD radiation is well understood. In this article, this assumption is tested on an inclusive sample of jets recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2010, which corresponds to 35 pb\u2212 1 of pp collisions delivered by the LHC at. In a subsample of events with single pp collisions, measurements corrected for detector efficiency and resolution are presented with full systematic uncertainties. Jet invariant mass, k t splitting scales and N-subjettiness variables are presented for anti-k t R= 1.0 jets and Cambridge-Aachen R= 1.2 jets. Jet invariant-mass spectra for Cambridge-Aachen R= 1.2 jets after a splitting and filtering procedure are also presented. Leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo \u2026",

            "Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency in crop production are critical for addressing the triple challenges of food security, environmental degradation and climate change. Such improvements are conditional not only on technological innovation, but also on socio-economic factors that are at present poorly understood. Here we examine historical patterns of agricultural nitrogen-use efficiency and find a broad range of national approaches to agricultural development and related pollution. We analyse examples of nitrogen use and propose targets, by geographic region and crop type, to meet the 2050 global food demand projected by the Food and Agriculture Organization while also meeting the Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to agriculture recently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, we discuss socio-economic policies and technological innovations that may help achieve them.",
