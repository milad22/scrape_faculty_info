            "ZnO typifies a class of materials that can be doped via native defects in only one way: either n type or p type. We explain this asymmetry in ZnO via a study of its intrinsic defect physics, including Zn O, Zn i, V O, O i, and V Zn and n-type impurity dopants, Al and F. We find that ZnO is n type at Zn-rich conditions. This is because (i) the Zn interstitial, Zn i, is a shallow donor, supplying electrons;(ii) its formation enthalpy is low for both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, so this defect is abundant; and (iii) the native defects that could compensate the n-type doping effect of Zn i (interstitial O, O i, and Zn vacancy, V Zn), have high formation enthalpies for Zn-rich conditions, so these \u201celectron killers\u201d are not abundant. We find that ZnO cannot be doped p type via native defects (O i, V Zn) despite the fact that they are shallow (ie, supplying holes at room temperature). This is because at both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, the defects \u2026",

The AX centers that convert acceptors into deep donors are found to be unstable except for P and As. Without compensation by intrinsic defects, the most likely cause for doping difficulty is the formation of interstitials for group-I elements and antisites for group-V elements.

            "Using a first-principles band structure method we have theoretically studied the effects of Ga additions on the electronic and structural properties of CuInSe2. We find that (i) with increasing xGa, the valence band maximum of CuIn1\u2212xGaxSe2 (CIGS) decreases slightly, while the conduction band minimum (and the band gap) of CIGS increases significantly, (ii) the acceptor formation energies are similar in both CuInSe2 (CIS) and CuGaSe2 (CGS), but the donor formation energy is larger in CGS than in CIS, (iii) the acceptor transition levels are shallower in CGS than in CIS, but the GaCu donor level in CGS is much deeper than the InCu donor level in CIS, and (iv) the stability domain of the chalcopyrite phase increases with respect to ordered defect compounds. Our results are compared with available experimental observations.",
