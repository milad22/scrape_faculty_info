            "Introductory courses in biochemistry teach that enzymes are specific for their substrates and the reactions they catalyze. Enzymes diverging from this statement are sometimes called promiscuous. It has been suggested that relaxed substrate and reaction specificities can have an important role in enzyme evolution; however, enzyme promiscuity also has an applied aspect. Enzyme condition promiscuity has, for a long time, been used to run reactions under conditions of low water activity that favor ester synthesis instead of hydrolysis. Together with enzyme substrate promiscuity, it is exploited in numerous synthetic applications, from the laboratory to industrial scale. Furthermore, enzyme catalytic promiscuity, where enzymes catalyze accidental or induced new reactions, has begun to be recognized as a valuable research and synthesis tool. Exploiting enzyme catalytic promiscuity might lead to improvements in \u2026",

Protein engineering has opened the possibility to change the reaction specificity of enzymes and allow for new reactions to take place in their active sites. We have used this strategy on the well-studied active-site scaffold offered by the serine hydrolase Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB, EC 3.1.1.3) to achieve catalytic activity for aldol reactions. The catalytic reaction was studied in detail by means of quantum chemical calculations in model systems. The predictions from the quantum chemical calculations were then challenged by experiments. Consequently, Ser105 in CALB was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis to create enzyme variants lacking the nucleophilic feature of the active site. The experiments clearly showed an increased reaction \u2026",
