The experiment exploits a new technique to modulate periodically the asymmetry between the two counter-rotating lasing modes. The measurements verify that the addition of injected noise can lead to an improved signal-to-noise ratio (relative to that observed with no externally injected noise).",

The experimental demonstration of chaotic communication with an optical system is described. An erbium-doped fiber ring laser (EDFRL) was used to produce chaotic light with a wavelength of 1.53 micrometers. A small 10-megahertz message was embedded in the larger chaotic carrier and transmitted to a receiver system where the message was recovered from the chaos. Chaotic optical waveforms can thus be used to communicate masked information at high bandwidths.",

Similar nonlocal coupling topologies implemented in networks of chaotic iterated maps also yield dynamical states exhibiting coexisting spatial domains of coherence and incoherence 7, 8. In these discrete-time systems, the phase is not a continuous variable, so these states are generalized chimeras with respect to a broader notion of incoherence. Chimeras continue to be the subject of intense theoretical investigation, but have yet to be realized experimentally 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

            "The repertoire of neural activity patterns that a cortical network can produce constrains the ability of the network to transfer and process information. Here, we measured activity patterns obtained from multisite local field potential recordings in cortex cultures, urethane-anesthetized rats, and awake macaque monkeys. First, we quantified the information capacity of the pattern repertoire of ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity using Shannon entropy. Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between stimulus and response using mutual information. By systematically changing the ratio of excitation\/inhibition (E\/I) in vitro and in a network model, we discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are maximized at a particular intermediate E\/I, at which ongoing activity emerges as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to correctly predict in vivo \u2026",
