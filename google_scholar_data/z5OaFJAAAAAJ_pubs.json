            "Infrared spectroscopy is a useful technique for the determination of conformation and orientation of membrane-associated proteins and lipids. The technique is especially powerful for detecting conformational changes by recording spectral differences before and after perturbations in physiological solution. Polarized infrared measurements on oriented membrane samples have revealed valuable information on the orientation of chemical groupings and substructures within membrane molecules which is difficult to obtain by other methods. The application of infrared spectroscopy to the static and dynamic structure of proteins and peptides in lipid bilayers is reviewed with some emphasis on the importance of sample preparation. Limitations of the technique with regard to the absolute determination of secondary structure and orientation and new strategies for structural assignments are also discussed.",

Despite this, they are poorly represented in the list of proteins with determined atomic-resolution structures, because both crystallography and NMR still encounter difficulties in handling membrane proteins. Large hydrophobic patches of membrane proteins strongly interfere with their crystallization for diffraction experiments (1-3); only a few examples can be mentioned when the structures of membrane-reconstituted proteins were determined by X-ray crystallography (3-8). Despite the considerable progress in determining atomicresolution structures of membrane proteins by solid-state and multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques (9-12), modern macromolecular NMR is limited to particles of moderate size.

The relative contents of a-helix,\/3-strand, and randomcoil, as well as the spatial orientations of the a-helices of these molecules, reconstituted in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and l-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer membranes, were determined using polarized attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The major component of the amide T bands of PLB and PLB26-52 was centered at 1654\u20141657 cm-1 and was assigned to a-helix. The fraction of a-helix in native PLB was 64\u201467%(33\u201435 residues), and the transmembrane \u2026",

A combination of Langmuir, Gouy-Chapman, and Boltzmann equations was used to describe the dependence of the zeta potential on the concentration of anions. The values of binding constants (K) and maximum numbers of binding sites per unit area (\u03c3 max) were determined by this method.

We studied a dodecamer peptide identified with phage display to possess affinity for graphite. Optical spectroscopy reveals that the peptide forms secondary structures both in powder form and in an aqueous medium. The dominant structure in the powder form is \u03b1-helix, which undergoes a transition to a distorted helical structure in aqueous solution. The peptide forms a complex reticular structure upon adsorption on graphene and graphite, having a helical conformation different from \u03b1-helix due to its interaction with the surface.

            "Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) hydrolyzes phospholipids to free fatty acids and lysolipids and thus initiates the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor, potent mediators of inflammation, allergy, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. The relative contributions of the physical properties of membranes and the structural changes in PLA2 to the interfacial activation of PLA2, that is, a strong increase in the lipolytic activity upon binding to the surface of phospholipid membranes or micelles, are not well understood. The present results demonstrate that both binding of PLA2 to phospholipid bilayers and its activity are facilitated by membrane surface electrostatics. Higher PLA2 activity toward negatively charged membranes is shown to result from stronger membrane-enzyme electrostatic interactions rather than selective hydrolysis of the acidic lipid. Phospholipid hydrolysis by PLA2 is followed by preferential removal of \u2026",

            "Mammalian 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalyzes conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, potent mediators of inflammation and allergy. Upon cell stimulation, 5-LO selectively binds to nuclear membranes and becomes activated, yet the mechanism of recruitment of 5-LO to nuclear membranes and the mode of 5-LO-membrane interactions are poorly understood. Here we show that membrane fluidity is an important determinant of membrane binding strength of 5-LO, penetration into the membrane hydrophobic core, and activity of the enzyme. The membrane binding strength and activity of 5-LO increase with the degree of lipid acyl chain cis-unsaturation and reach a plateau with 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonolyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC). A fraction of tryptophans of 5-LO penetrate into the hydrocarbon region of fluid PAPC membranes, but not into solid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine \u2026",

A \u2018spring\u2010loaded\u2019 displacement over at least 100 A provides a mechanism for the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane, but does not explain how the two membranes are brought into fusion contact. Here we examine, by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the secondary structure and orientation of HA reconstituted in planar membranes. At neutral pH, the orientation of the HA trimers in planar membranes is approximately perpendicular to the membrane. However, at the pH of fusion, the HA trimers are tilted 55\u201370 degrees from the membrane normal in the presence or absence of bound target membranes.
