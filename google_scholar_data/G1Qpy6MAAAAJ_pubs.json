            "Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on Hg Te\u2215 Cd Te quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator.

Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin\u2013orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit 3, 4, 5, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields 6. Bulk Bi 1-x Sb x single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates 7, 8 for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator 9, 10, 11.
