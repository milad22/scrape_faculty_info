            "The tensile strengths of individual multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were measured with a \u201cnanostressing stage\u201d located within a scanning electron microscope. The tensile-loading experiment was prepared and observed entirely within the microscope and was recorded on video. The MWCNTs broke in the outermost layer (\u201csword-in-sheath\u201d failure), and the tensile strength of this layer ranged from 11 to 63 gigapascals for the set of 19 MWCNTs that were loaded. Analysis of the stress-strain curves for individual MWCNTs indicated that the Young9s modulus E of the outermost layer varied from 270 to 950 gigapascals. Transmission electron microscopic examination of the broken nanotube fragments revealed a variety of structures, such as a nanotube ribbon, a wave pattern, and partial radial collapse.",

For 8 of these ropes strain data were obtained and they broke at strain values of 5.3% or lower. The force-strain data are well fit by a model that assumes the load is carried by the SWCNTs on the perimeter of each rope. This model provides an average breaking strength of SWCNTs on the perimeter of each rope; the 15 values range from 13 to 52 GPa (mean 30 GPa).

The experimental verification, and in some cases refutation, of these predictions, along with a number of computer simulation methods applied to their modeling, has led over the past decade to an improved but by no means complete understanding of the mechanics of carbon nanotubes. We review the theoretical predictions and discuss the experimental techniques that are most often used for the challenging tasks of visualizing and manipulating these tiny structures.

There has already been some research on manipulating individual sheets on HOPG surfaces with scanning probe microscope tips; such sheets were obtained either accidentally or with a less controllable indenting technique. Here we present a different approach, which is more reliable and controllable. The HOPG surface was first patterned to create an array of small graphite islands by reactive ion etching of the HOPG surface with an oxygen plasma. These islands were then manipulated with an atomic force microscope tip. Carbon nanotubes represent a promising material for nanotechnology and can be considered as a graphene sheet rolled into a seamless cylinder.

            "Simulations that model the effects of conformational strain on the chemical reactivity of single-walled carbon nanotubes suggest a method for significantly enhancing their reactivity locally by controlled deformations. The chemisorption of hydrogen atoms is predicted to be enhanced by as much as 1.6 eV at regions of high conformational deformation, suggesting that local reactivity will be significantly enhanced. Analysis of the local electronic density of states suggests the introduction of radical p orbital character to the sites that are locally deformed, consistent with the heightened reactivity and large pyramidalization angles at these sites. Preliminary experimental data consistent with this predicted heightened reactivity is also presented. ",

            "Ideal nanowire interconnects for nanoelectronics will be refractory, covalently bonded, and highly conductive, irrespective of crystallographic orientation. Theoretical studies suggest that boron nanotubes should be stable and exhibit higher electrical conductivities than those of carbon nanotubes. We describe CVD growth of elemental boron nanowires, which are found to be dense nanowhiskers rather than nanotubes. Conductivity measurements establish that they are semiconducting, with electrical properties consistent with those of elemental boron. High conductivities should be achievable through doping. ",
