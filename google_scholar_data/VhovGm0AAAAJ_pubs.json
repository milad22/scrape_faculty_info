In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013.Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes.

To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017.The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data.

Existing dielectrics for high\u2010energy\u2010storage capacitors and potential new capacitor technologies are reviewed toward realizing these goals. Various dielectric materials with desirable permittivity and dielectric breakdown strength potentially meeting the device requirements are discussed. However, some significant limitations for current dielectrics can be ascribed to their low permittivity, low breakdown strength, and high hysteresis loss, which will decrease their energy density and efficiency. Thus, the implementation of dielectric materials for high\u2010energy\u2010density applications requires the comprehensive understanding of both the materials design and processing.

            "Three decades of rapid economic development is causing severe and widespread PM2.5 (particulate matter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm) pollution in China. However, research on the health impacts of PM2.5 exposure has been hindered by limited historical PM2.5 concentration data.We estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations from 2004 to 2013 in China at 0.1\u00b0 resolution using the most recent satellite data and evaluated model performance with available ground observations.We developed a two-stage spatial statistical model using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD) and assimilated meteorology, land use data, and PM2.5 concentrations from China\u2019s recently established ground monitoring network. An inverse variance weighting (IVW) approach was developed to combine MODIS Dark Target and Deep Blue AOD to optimize data \u2026",

We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015).We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as \u2026",

            "The authors describe a model reference adaptive control system for speed control of the vector-controlled inverter induction motor drive without a speed sensor. The rotor speed is estimated with a full-order adaptive observer and is used as the feedback signal for the vector and speed controls. In order to estimate the speed accurately at low speeds, the motor stator resistance is also identified at the same time to correct the mismatched resistance value used in the observer. The resulting system is verified to be hyperstable. As a result, the drive can be operated in a wide range of speed, and especially, it can be operated stably at the state of zero speed. Experiments also show that the scheme is effective.< >",
