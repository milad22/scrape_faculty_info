Here we investigate what these data can tell us about neutrino interactions with matter, including the poorly constrained flavor-changing \u03bde\u2013\u03bd\u03c4 interactions. We give examples of the interaction parameters that are excluded by the solar\/KamLAND data and are beyond the reach of other experiments. We also demonstrate that flavor-changing interactions, at the allowed level, may profoundly modify the conversion probability for neutrinos of energy \u22726 MeV and the values of the mass parameter inferred from the data. The implications for future experiments are discussed.",

            "We study the matter effects on oscillations of high-energy neutrinos in the Universe. A substantial effect can be produced by scattering of the neutrinos from cosmological sources (z\u2273 1) on the relic neutrino background, provided that the latter has large CP asymmetry: \u03b7\u2261(n \u03bd\u2212 n \u03bd)\/n \u03b3\u2273 1, where n \u03bd, n \u03bd and n \u03b3 are the concentrations of neutrinos, antineutrinos, and photons. We consider in detail the dynamics of conversion in the expanding neutrino background. Applications are given to the diffuse fluxes of neutrinos from gamma ray bursters, active galactic nuclei, and the decay of superheavy relics. We find that the vacuum oscillation probability can be modified by\u223c 10\u2212 20%, and in extreme cases allowed by present bounds on \u03b7 the effect can reach\u223c 1 0 0%. The signatures of matter effects would consist (i) for both active-active and active-sterile conversion, in a deviation of the numbers of events produced in a \u2026",

            "In the delayed explosion scenario of core-collapse supernovae, the accretion phase shows pronounced convective overturns and a low-multipole hydrodynamic instability, the standing accretion shock instability. These effects imprint detectable fast time variations on the emerging neutrino flux. Among existing detectors, IceCube is best suited to this task, providing an event rate of\u223c 1000 ms\u2212 1 during the accretion phase for a fiducial SN distance of 10 kpc, comparable to what could be achieved with a megaton water Cherenkov detector. If the standing accretion shock instability activity lasts for several hundred ms, a Fourier component with an amplitude of 1% of the average signal clearly sticks out from the shot noise. We analyze in detail the output of axially symmetric hydrodynamical simulations that predict much larger amplitudes up to frequencies of a few hundred Hz. If these models are roughly representative \u2026",
