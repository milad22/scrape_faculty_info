The objectives of this study are three-fold: (1) to explore factors of user\u2013Web interaction in finding factual information and what happens during this interaction; (2) to develop a conceptual framework for studying user\u2013Web interaction; and (3) to apply a process-tracing method for conducting holistic user\u2013Web studies. The proposed model consists of three components: user, interface, and the World Wide Web. User\u2013Web interaction is viewed as a communication process facilitated through an interface. A process-tracing technique has been designed to capture the processes of user-Web interactions. Twenty-four graduate students participated in this study. Prior to the interaction, each participant was given a questionnaire to report his\/her computer and Web experience, the State \u2026",

It reports on Part 1 of a longitudinal study of decision making on document use by academics during an actual research project. (Part 2 followed up the same users on how the selected documents were actually used in subsequent stages.) The participants are 25 self\u2010selected faculty and graduate students in Agricultural Economics. After a reference interview, the researcher conducted a search of DIALOG databases and prepared a printout. The users selected documents from this printout; they were asked to read and think aloud while selecting documents. Their verbal reports were recorded and analyzed from a utility\u2010theoretic perspective. The following model of the decision\u2010making in the selection process emerged: document information elements (DIEs) in document records provide the information for judging \u2026",

The linguistic analyses focus on query structures, lexicon, and word associations using statistical measures such as Zipf distribution and mutual information. A data model with finest granularity is used for data storage and iterative analyses. Patterns and trends of querying behavior are identified and compared with previous studies.",
