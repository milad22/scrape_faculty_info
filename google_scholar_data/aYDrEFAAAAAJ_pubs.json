            "This textbook presents a systematic and unifying viewpoint for a wide class of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques in time domain and frequency domain. It is directed towards active researchers in physics, optics, chemistry, and materials science, as well as graduate students who enter this complex and rapidly developing field. Nonlinear optical interactions of laser fields with matter provide powerful spectroscopic tools for the understanding of microscopic interactions and dynamic processes. One of the major obstacles facing researchers in this field, however, is the flood of experimental techniques and terminologies, which create a serious language barrier. The general microscopic correlation function approach to the nonlinear optical response developed in this book is essential for understanding the relationships among different techniques and a comparison of their information content, the design of new measurements, and for a systematic comparison of the optical response of different systems such as dyes in solutions, atoms and molecules in the gas phase, liquids, molecular aggregates and superlatives, and semiconductor nanostructures. The approach is based on formulating the nonlinear response by representing the state of matter by the density matrix and following its evolution on Liouville space. Current active research areas such as femtosecond time-domain techniques, semi-classical and wave-packet dynamics, pulse shaping, pulse locking, exciton confinement, and the interplay of electronic, nuclear and field coherence are emphasized. The material has been developed from the author's highly successful interdisciplinary course \u2026",

            "We investigate the third-order nonlinear-optical susceptibility \u03c7 (3) in molecular aggregates and its scaling with aggregate size. The aggregate is modeled as a collection of N-interacting, homogeneously broadened two-level systems, where the interaction includes both the static dipole-dipole coupling and superradiant coupling. Our expression for \u03c7 (3), derived using Liouville-space Green-function techniques, contains contributions from excitons as well as biexcitons. The scaling of \u03c7 (3) with aggregate size and its dependence on the laser detuning and homogeneous and inhomogeneous dephasing rates are analyzed. \u03c7 (3) contains terms that scale as\u223c N 2 and\u223c N (N-1). However, under off-resonant conditions these terms interfere destructively, resulting in a linear\u223c N scaling, which is precisely what is expected for N monomers.
