            "Phase transitions to quantum condensed phases\u2014such as Bose\u2013Einstein condensation (BEC), superfluidity, and superconductivity\u2014have long fascinated scientists, as they bring pure quantum effects to a macroscopic scale. BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 10 9 times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe \u2026",

A surprising exception to this behaviour has recently been observed in doped silver chalcogenides 3, 4, 5, which exhibit an anomalously large, quasi-linear magnetoresistive response that extends down to low fields and survives, even at extreme fields of 55 T and beyond. Here we present a simple model of a macroscopically disordered and strongly inhomogeneous semiconductor that exhibits a similar non-saturating magnetoresistance. In addition to providing a possible explanation for the behaviour of doped silver chalcogenides, our model suggests potential routes for the construction of magnetic field sensors with a large, controllable and linear response.",

            "The phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance in manganites 1 is generally agreed to be a result of competition between crystal phases with different electronic, magnetic and structural order; a competition which can be strong enough to cause phase separation between metallic ferromagnetic and insulating charge-modulated states 2, 3, 4, 5. Nevertheless, closer inspection of phase diagrams in many manganites reveals complex phases where the two order parameters of magnetism and charge modulation unexpectedly coexist 6, 7. Here we show that such experiments can be naturally explained within a phenomenological Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory. In contrast to models where phase separation originates from disorder 8 or as a strain-induced kinetic phenomenon 9, we argue that magnetic and charge modulation coexist in new thermodynamic phases. This leads to a rich diagram of equilibrium phases \u2026",

            "Although not an intrinsic superconductor, graphite exhibits superconductivity when intercalated with certain dopants 1. Perhaps the most studied of these graphite-based superconductors are the alkali metal\u2013graphite intercalation compounds (GICs)(ref. 2), of which the easiest to fabricate is C 8 K (ref. 3), with a transition temperature (ref. 2). By increasing the alkali metal concentration (through high-pressure fabrication techniques), the transition temperature can be increased up to 5 K in C 2 Na (ref. 4). Superconductivity in C 6 Yb and C 6 Ca with and 11.5 K, respectively, and at ambient conditions has been observed 5. Here we explore the architecture of the states near the Fermi level and identify characteristics of the electronic band structure generic to GICs. In addition to the expected charge transfer from the intercalant atoms to the graphene sheets, resulting from the occupation of the \u03c0 bands, we find that in all of \u2026",
