            "The performance of several popular water models (TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP5P and TIP4P\/2005) is analyzed. For that purpose the predictions for ten different properties of water are investigated, namely: 1. vapour\u2013liquid equilibria (VLE) and critical temperature; 2. surface tension; 3. densities of the different solid structures of water (ices); 4. phase diagram; 5. melting-point properties; 6. maximum in the density of water at room pressure and thermal coefficients \u03b1 and \u03baT; 7. structure of liquid water and ice; 8. equation of state at high pressures; 9. self-diffusion coefficient; 10. dielectric constant. For each property, the performance of each model is analyzed in detail with a critical discussion of the possible reason of the success or failure of the model. A final judgement on the quality of these models is provided. TIP4P\/2005 provides the best description of almost all properties of the list, the only exception being the dielectric \u2026",

In this paper our aim is to establish whether the recently proposed TIP4P\/2005 model is capable of reproducing a number of these anomalies. Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate both the maximum in density and the minimum in the isothermal compressibility along a number of isobars. It is shown that the model correctly describes the decrease in the temperature of the density maximum with increasing pressure. At atmospheric pressure the model exhibits an additional minimum in density at a temperature of about 200K, in good agreement with recent experimental work on super-cooled confined water. The model also presents a minimum in the isothermal compressibility close to 310K. We have also investigated the atmospheric pressure isobar for three \u2026",

The condition of chemical equilibrium (i.e., equal chemical potential of the salt in the solid and in the solution) is obtained at room temperature and pressure to determine the solubility of the salt. We used the same methodology that was described in our previous work [E. Sanz and C. Vega, J. Chem. Phys. 126, 014507 (2007)]10.1063\/1.2397683 although several modifications were introduced to improve the accuracy of the calculations. It is found that the predictions of the solubility are quite sensitive to the details of the force field used. Certain force fields underestimate the experimental solubility of NaCl in water by a factor of four, whereas the predictions of other force fields are within 20% of the experimental value. Direct coexistence molecular dynamic simulations were also performed to determine \u2026",

Using Monte Carlo simulations, with special moves to sample proton-disordered configurations, the dielectric constant has been rigorously evaluated. We also used an approximate route in which proton-disordered configurations satisfying the Bernal\u2212Fowler rules were generated following the algorithm proposed by Buch et al. (Buch, V.; Sandler, P.; Sadlej, J. J. Phys. Chem.

            "Water anomalies still defy explanation. In the supercooled liquid, many quantities, for example heat capacity and isothermal compressibility , show a large increase. The question arises if these quantities diverge, or if they go through a maximum. The answer is key to our understanding of water anomalies. However, it has remained elusive in experiments because crystallization always occurred before any extremum is reached. Here we report measurements of the sound velocity of water in a scarcely explored region of the phase diagram, where water is both supercooled and at negative pressure. We find several anomalies: maxima in the adiabatic compressibility and nonmonotonic density dependence of the sound velocity, in contrast with a standard extrapolation of the equation of state. This is reminiscent of the behavior of supercritical fluids. To support this interpretation, we have performed simulations with the 2005 revision of the \u2026",
