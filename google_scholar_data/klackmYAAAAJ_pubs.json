Unlike previous planet-finding instruments, which are seeing-limited, iLocater operates at the diffraction limit and uses single mode fibers to eliminate the effects of modal noise entirely. By receiving starlight from two 8.4m diameter telescopes that each use \u201cextreme\u201d adaptive optics (AO), iLocater shows promise to overcome the limitations that prevent existing instruments from generating sub \u2026",
