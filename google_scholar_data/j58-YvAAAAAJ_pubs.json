As a population, the immature T lymphocytes generated in the thymus express a very diverse set of TCR specificities. A process of positive selection filters this broad repertoire to optimize peripheral T cells for antigen recognition in the context of available MHC products. Only those precursor T cells whose TCRs generate an adequate but not excessive signalling response to self-peptides bound to the expressed MHC proteins undergo successful maturation 1. Here we show that post-thymic self-recognition facilitates the antigen reactivity of mature T cells.

Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, we examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T cell activation. We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity.

The function of these receptors may be to confer upon NK cells the capacity to distinguish normal self cells from cells that have down\u2010regulated expression of some or all self\u2010class I molecules, Ly49 receptors discriminate between different class I molecules, and are distributed in expression to overlapping subsets of NK cells.

The 5E6 (Ly49C)+ subset of F1 NK cells lyse BALB\/c (H-2d) but not B6 (H-2b) targets unless either anti-5E6 or anti-H-2Kb MAbs are present. H-2Dd transgenic B6 (D8) targets are not susceptible to F1 Ly49A+ effectors. Furthermore, 5E6+ Ly49A+ F1 effectors lyse B6 and BALB\/c targets only in the presence of anti-5E6 and anti-Ly49A MAbs, respectively. Thus, recognition of H-2Kb by 5E6 and H-2Dd by Ly49A transduce independent inhibitory signals. Moreover, anti-5E6 MAbs enable 5E6+ BALB\/c NK cells to lyse (BALB\/c \u00d7 B6)F1 targets. These data support the \u201cmissing self\u201d and not the \u201chemopoietic histocompatibility antigen\u201d hypothesis for HR.

In contrast, in young mice, splenic NK cells labeled very rapidly with BrdU, although cell cycle analyses and BrdU pulse-labeling studies suggested that most of this proliferation occurred in a precursor population. A somewhat larger percentage of bone marrow NK cells was cycling, suggesting that these proliferating cells are the precursors of the mostly nondividing or slowly dividing splenic NK cells.

            "T cell receptor (TCR) signaling triggered by recognition of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands has been proposed to maintain the viability of na\u00efve T cells and to provoke their proliferation in T cell\u2013deficient hosts. Consistent with this, the partially phosphorylated state of TCR\u03b6 chains in na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo was found to be actively maintained by TCR interactions with specific peptide-containing MHC molecules. TCR ligand-dependent phosphorylation of TCR\u03b6 was lost within one day of cell transfer into MHC-deficient hosts, yet the survival of transferred CD4+ lymphocytes was the same in recipients with or without MHC class II expression for one month. Thus, despite clear evidence for TCR signaling in nonactivated na\u00efve T cells, these data argue against the concept that such signaling plays a predominant role in determining lymphocyte lifespan.",

            "Both iron deficiency and malaria are common in much of sub-Saharan Africa, and the interaction between these conditions is complex. To investigate the association between nutritional iron status, immunoglobulins, and clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria, we determined the incidence of malaria in a cohort of children between the ages of 8 months and 8 years who were living on the Kenyan coast. Biochemical iron status and malaria-specific immune responses were determined during 2 cross-sectional surveys. We found that the incidence of clinical malaria was significantly lower among iron-deficient children (incidence-rate ratio [IRR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51\u20130.99; P<.05), that the incidence of malaria was significantly associated with plasma ferritin concentration (IRR for log ferritin concentration, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01\u20132.17; P<.05), and that iron status was strongly associated with a range of \u2026",

            "To gain insight into why antibody responses to malarial antigens tend to be short lived, we studied antigenspecific memory B cells from donors in an area where malaria is endemic.We compared antibody and memory B cell responses to tetanus toxoid with those to 3 Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine antigens: the Cterminal portion of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP119), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), and the cysteinerich interdomain region 1\u03b1 (CIDR1\u03b1) of a protein from the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. These data are the first to be generated on memory B cells in children who are in the process of acquiring antimalarial immunity, and they reveal defects in B cell memory to P. falciparum antigens. Compared with the results for tetanus toxoid, more donors who were positive for antibody to AMA1 and CIDR1\u03b1 were negative for memory B cells. These data imply \u2026",
