The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026",

Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5\u03c3 evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode.

            "The detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos as cosmic messengers has been an important goal of astroparticle physics. Being stable, electrically neutral particles, high-energy neutrinos are able to propagate almost undisturbed through the universe from their production sites to Earth keeping their directional and energy information. Hence, they constitute excellent cosmic messenger particles, particularly at the highest energies. They arise from weak decays of hadrons, mostly pions and kaons, which are expected to be produced by hadronic interactions of cosmic rays in the surrounding matter of the cosmic-ray accelerator. Their observation will help to elucidate the unknown sources of high-energy cosmic rays (Gaisser et al. 1995; Learned & Mannheim 2000;",

For the first time, the DeepCore subarray is included in the analysis, lowering the energy threshold and extending the search to the austral summer. The 317 days of data collected between June 2010 and May 2011 are consistent with the expected background from atmospheric muons and neutrinos. Upper limits are set on the dark matter annihilation rate, with conversions to limits on spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross sections of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) on protons, for WIMP masses in the range 20\u20135000 GeV\/c 2. These are the most stringent spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross section limits to date above 35 GeV\/c 2 for most WIMP models.",

Using this instrument, we aimed to detect the first extraterrestrial neutrinos, and thus to explore territories previously inaccessible to astronomy. These neutrinos have now been detected: in Aartsen et al.(2013, 2014e), the IceCube Collaboration presented the first evidence for a flux of highenergy extraterrestrial neutrinos, based on a search for events that start and deposit\uf089 30 TeV inside the detection volume of IceCube. Indications for this flux had already been found in earlier analyses performed on data taken during the construction phase of IceCube (Sch\u00f6nwald et al. 2013; Aartsen et al. 2014c, 2014d). More recently, the flux was measured down to deposited energies of 10 TeV (Aartsen et al. 2015a), and evidence \u2026",
