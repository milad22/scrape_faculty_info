The key science objectives and the contribution that EMFISIS makes to providing measurements as well as theory and modeling are described. The key components of the instruments suite, both electronics and sensors, including key functional parameters, calibration, and performance, demonstrate that EMFISIS provides the needed measurements for the science of the RBSP mission. The EMFISIS operational modes and data products, along with online availability and data tools provide the radiation belt science community with one the most complete sets of data ever collected.",

            "This paper presents a comprehensive review of dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves in space and laboratory plasmas. We start with linear properties of Alfv\u00e9n waves and show how the inclusion of ion gyroradius, parallel electron inertia, and finite frequency effects modify the Alfv\u00e9n wave properties. Detailed discussions of inertial and kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves and their polarizations as well as their relations to drift Alfv\u00e9n waves are presented. Up to date observations of waves and field parameters deduced from the measurements by Freja, Fast, and other spacecraft are summarized. We also present laboratory measurements of dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves, that are of most interest to auroral physics. Electron acceleration by Alfv\u00e9n waves and possible connections of dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves with ionospheric-magnetospheric resonator and global field-line resonances are also reviewed. Theoretical efforts are directed on studies \u2026",

            "Recent analysis of satellite data obtained during the 9 October 2012 geomagnetic storm identified the development of peaks in electron phase space density 1, which are compelling evidence for local electron acceleration in the heart of the outer radiation belt 2, 3, but are inconsistent with acceleration by inward radial diffusive transport 4, 5. However, the precise physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration on 9 October was not identified. Previous modelling has indicated that a magnetospheric electromagnetic emission known as chorus could be a potential candidate for local electron acceleration 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, but a definitive resolution of the importance of chorus for radiation-belt acceleration was not possible because of limitations in the energy range and resolution of previous electron observations and the lack of a dynamic global wave model. Here we report high-resolution electron observations 11 \u2026",

            "The Van Allen radiation belts contain ultrarelativistic electrons trapped in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Since their discovery in 1958, a fundamental unanswered question has been how electrons can be accelerated to such high energies. Two classes of processes have been proposed: transport and acceleration of electrons from a source population located outside the radiation belts (radial acceleration) or acceleration of lower-energy electrons to relativistic energies in situ in the heart of the radiation belts (local acceleration). We report measurements from NASA\u2019s Van Allen Radiation Belt Storm Probes that clearly distinguish between the two types of acceleration. The observed radial profiles of phase space density are characteristic of local acceleration in the heart of the radiation belts and are inconsistent with a predominantly radial acceleration process.",

These structures coincide with larger\u2010scale Alfv\u00e9nic waves that carry a large net Poynting flux along magnetic field lines toward the Earth. Both structures are typically observed in the PSBL but have also been observed deeper in the plasma sheet. The small\u2010scale spikes have electric field amplitudes up to 300 mV m\u22121 and associated magnetic field variations between 0.5 and 5 nT. Previous analysis has shown that the larger\u2010scale Alfv\u00e9n waves have periods of \u223c20\u201360 s and carry enough Poynting flux to explain the generation of the most intense auroral structures observed in the Polar Ultraviolet Imager data set.
