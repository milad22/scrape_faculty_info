            "The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) mission is being designed to establish charged-particle astronomy with ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and to observe cosmogenic tau neutrinos (CTNs). The study of UHECRs and CTNs from space will yield orders-of-magnitude increase in statistics of observed UHECRs at the highest energies, and the observation of the cosmogenic flux of neutrinos for a range of UHECR models. These observations should solve the long-standing puzzle of the origin of the highest energy particles ever observed, providing a new window onto the most energetic environments and events in the Universe, while studying particle interactions well beyond accelerator energies. The discovery of CTNs will help solve the puzzle of the origin of UHECRs and begin a new field of Astroparticle Physics with the study of neutrino properties at ultra-high energies.",

            "In the last few years, radio detection of cosmic rays has matured from small prototype installations to full-fledged experiments contributing valuable information in the field of cosmic-ray physics [1]. In particular, radio detection has proven to be able to extract information on the energy [2\u20134] and mass [2, 5\u20137] of the primary cosmic rays with a quality competitive with other detection techniques. To maximize the potential of radio detection arrays, a precise time synchronization of individual radio detector stations is needed. This is true in particular if interferometric analysis techniques are to be employed [8]. Another analysis strategy that requires very precise timing is the determination of the opening angle of the hyperbolic wavefront emitted by extensive air showers to deduce masssensitive parameters [9]. The consequence is that any radio detectors operating in the frequency band below 100 MHz need a time \u2026",

We report the performance in offline testing of the first level trigger algorithm on data from JEM-EUSO prototypes and laboratory measurements observing different light sources: data taken during a high altitude balloon flight over Canada, laser pulses observed from the ground traversing the real atmosphere, and model landscapes reproducing realistic aspect ratios and light conditions as would be \u2026",

Our preliminary analysis indicates that JEM-EUSO, taking advantage of its large FOV and good sensitivity, should be able to detect meteors down to absolute magnitude close to 7. This means that JEM-EUSO should be able to record a statistically significant flux of meteors, including both sporadic ones, and events produced by different meteor streams. Being unaffected by adverse weather conditions, JEM-EUSO can also be a very important facility for the detection of bright meteors and fireballs, as these events can be detected even in conditions of very high sky background. In the case of bright events, moreover, exhibiting some persistence of the meteor train, preliminary simulations show that it should be possible to exploit the motion of the ISS \u2026",

Experimental results matched the expected behavior of the logic and satisfied the requirements conceived for the FLT. The sensitivity of EUSO-SPB to the detection of UHECRs was established.",
