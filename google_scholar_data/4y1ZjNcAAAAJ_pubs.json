            "We develop an effective field theory for dissipative fluids which governs the dynamics of long-lived gapless modes associated with conserved quantities. The resulting theory gives a path integral formulation of fluctuating hydrodynamics which systematically incorporates nonlinear interactions of noises. The dynamical variables are mappings between a \u201cfluid spacetime\u201d and the physical spacetime and an essential aspect of our formulation is to identify the appropriate symmetries in the fluid spacetime. The theory applies to nonlinear disturbances around a general density matrix. For a thermal density matrix, we require an additional Z 2 symmetry, to which we refer as the local KMS condition. This leads to the standard constraints of hydrodynamics, as well as a nonlinear generalization of the Onsager relations. It also leads to an emergent supersymmetry in the classical statistical regime, and a higher derivative \u2026",

We first work out in detail the classical limit of the hydrodynamical action, which exhibits many simplifications. In particular, this enables a transparent formulation of the action in physical spacetime in the presence of arbitrary external fields. It also helps to clarify issues related to field redefinitions and frame choices. We then propose that the action is invariant under a Z 2 symmetry to which we refer as the dynamical KMS symmetry. The dynamical KMS symmetry is physically equivalent to the previously proposed local KMS condition in the classical limit, but is more convenient to implement and more general. It is applicable to any states in local equilibrium rather than just thermal density matrix perturbed by external background fields. Finally we elaborate the formulation for a conformal fluid, which contains some new \u2026",

As a first step, in this paper we restrict to systems with a non-dissipative horizon. By integrating out gapped degrees of freedom in the bulk gravitational system between an asymptotic boundary and a horizon, we are led to a formulation of hydrodynamics where the dynamical variables are not standard velocity and temperature fields, but the relative embedding of the boundary and horizon hypersurfaces. At zeroth order, this action reduces to that proposed by Dubovsky et al. as an off-shell formulation of ideal fluid dynamics.",

Most physical processes we observe in nature involve variations of macroscopic quantities over spatial and temporal scales much larger than microscopic molecular collision scales and thus can be considered as in local equilibrium. For a many-body system in local equilibrium a stronger version of the second law applies which says that the entropy production at each spacetime point should be non-negative. In this paper we provide a proof of the second law for such systems and a first derivation of the local second law. For this purpose we develop a general non-equilibrium effective field theory of slow degrees of freedom from integrating out fast degrees of freedom in a quantum many-body system and consider its classical limit. The key elements of the proof are the presence of a  symmetry, which can be considered as a proxy for local equilibrium and micro-time-reversibility, and a classical remnant of quantum unitarity. The  symmetry leads to a local current from a procedure analogous to that used in the Noether theorem. Unitarity leads to a definite sign of the divergence of the current. We also discuss the origin of an arrow of time, as well as the coincidence of causal and thermodynamical arrows of time. Applied to hydrodynamics, the proof gives a first-principle derivation of the phenomenological entropy current condition and provides a constructive procedure for obtaining the entropy current.",
