The dependence of CT texture features on gray\u2010level discretization was also evaluated.A texture phantom composed of 10 different cartridges of different materials was scanned on eight different CT scanners from three different manufacturers.

In this first paper, we construct a mathematical model consisting of a single conductance-based neuron together with intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics. We formulate a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally \u2026",

By incorporating conservation of particles and charge, and accounting for the energy required to restore ionic gradients, we extend the classic Hodgkin\u2013Huxley formalism to uncover a unification of neuronal membrane dynamics. By examining the dynamics as a function of potassium and oxygen, we now account for a wide range of neuronal activities, from spikes to seizures, spreading depression (whether high potassium or hypoxia induced), mixed seizure and spreading depression states, and the terminal anoxic \u201cwave of death.\u201d Such a unified framework demonstrates that all of these dynamics lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane.

We seek to study these dynamics with respect to the following compartments: neurons, glia, and extracellular space. We are particularly interested in the slower time-scale dynamics that determine overall excitability, and set the stage for transient episodes of persistent oscillations, working memory, or seizures. In this second of two companion papers, we present an ionic current network model composed of populations of Hodgkin\u2013Huxley type excitatory and inhibitory neurons embedded within extracellular space and glia, in order to investigate the role of micro-environmental ionic dynamics on the stability of persistent activity.

            "Observations in cultured mouse astrocytes suggest anti-phase synchronization of cytosolic calcium concentrations in nearest neighbor cells that are coupled through gap junctions. A mathematical model is used to investigate physiologic conditions under which diffusion of the second messenger inositol (1, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (IP3) through gap junctions can facilitate synchronized anti-phase Ca2+ oscillations. Our model predicts anti-phase oscillations in both cytosolic calcium and IP3 concentrations if (a) the gap junction permeability is within a window of values and (b) IP3 is regenerated in the astrocytes via, e.g. phospholipase C\u03b4. This result sheds new light on the current dispute on the mechanism of intercellular calcium signaling. It provides indirect evidence for a partially regenerative mechanism as the model excludes anti-phase synchrony in the absence of IP3 regeneration.",

However, existing techniques are too limited to measure all but a small fraction of the physical variables and parameters of neuronal networks. We constructed models of the biophysical properties of neuronal membrane, synaptic, and microenvironment dynamics, and incorporated them into a model-based predictor-controller framework from modern control theory. We demonstrate that it is now possible to meaningfully estimate the dynamics of small neuronal networks using as few as a single measured variable. Specifically, we assimilate noisy membrane potential measurements from individual hippocampal neurons to reconstruct the dynamics of networks of these cells, their extracellular microenvironment, and the activities of different neuronal types during seizures. We use reconstruction to account for unmeasured parts of the neuronal system, relating micro-domain metabolic processes to cellular excitability, and validate the reconstruction of cellular dynamical interactions against actual measurements. Data assimilation, the fusing of measurement with computational models, has significant potential to improve the way we observe and understand brain dynamics.",
