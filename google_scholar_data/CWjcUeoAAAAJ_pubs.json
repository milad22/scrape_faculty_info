Since both electron scattering and photoionization (the inverse of photo-recombination) are the conventional means for interrogating the structure of atoms and molecules, this result implies that existing few-cycle infrared lasers can be implemented for ultrafast imaging of transient molecules with temporal resolution of a few femtoseconds.",

According to the QRS, HHG spectra can be expressed as a product of a returning electron wave packet and the photorecombination differential cross section of the laser-free continuum electron back to the initial bound state. We show that the shape of the returning electron wave packet is determined mostly by the laser.

            "When an atom or molecule is exposed to a short intense laser pulse, electrons that were removed at an earlier time may be driven back by the oscillating electric field of the laser to recollide with the parent ion, to incur processes like high-order harmonic generation (HHG), high-energy above-threshold ionization (HATI) and nonsequential double ionization (NSDI). Over the years, a rescattering model (the three-step model) has been used to understand these strong field phenomena qualitatively, but not quantitatively. Recently we have established such a quantitative rescattering (QRS) theory. According to QRS, the yields for HHG, HATI and NSDI can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet with various field-free electron\u2013ion scattering cross sections, namely photo-recombination, elastic electron scattering and electron-impact ionization, respectively.

Here we demonstrate the retrieval of multiple bond lengths from a polyatomic molecule by simultaneously measuring the C\u2013C and C\u2013H bond lengths in aligned acetylene. Our approach takes the method beyond the hitherto achieved imaging of simple diatomic molecules and is based on the combination of a 160 kHz mid-infrared few-cycle laser source with full three-dimensional electron\u2013ion coincidence detection. Our technique provides an accessible and robust route towards imaging ultrafast processes in complex gas-phase molecules with atto-to femto-second temporal resolution.",

It is shown that the momentum spectra at low energies between the TDSE and SFA are quite different and the differences arise largely from the absence of a long-range Coulomb interaction in the SFA. We further found that the low-energy 2D momentum spectra from the TDSE exhibit ubiquitous fanlike features where the number of stripes is due to a single dominant angular momentum of the low-energy electron. The specific dominant angular momentum in turn has been found to be decided by the minimum number of photons needed to ionize the atom only. The electron momentum spectra \u2026",
