The upgrade to the system, completed in April 1995, met or surpassed all technical requirements. The acceptance tests demonstrated exceptional performance throughout the system: high driver stability (< 2% variations), precise control of the beam profiles and amplifier gains, 75% frequency-conversion efficiency, beam energy balance less than 8% and stable on-target irradiation of up to 37 kJ UV. We present these results and show that the system performance is well modeled by our propagation and frequency-conversion codes.",

            "For the past four decades, scientists throughout the world have pursued the dream of controlled thermonuclear fusion. The attraction of this goal is the enormous energy that is potentially available in fusion fuels and the view of fusion as a safe, clean energy source. The fusion reaction with the highest cross section uses the deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen, and DT would be the fuel of choice for the first generation of fusion reactors.(See the article by J. Geoffrey Cordey, Robert J. Goldston and Ronald R. Parker, January, page 22.) Development of an economically viable fusion reactor would literally give us the energy equivalent of oceans of oil. Because seawater contains about 40 g of deuterium and 0.1 g of lithium per tonne, every barrel of seawater contains the energy equivalent of almost 30 barrels of oil in deuterium fuel and about one-fifth of a barrel of oil in DT fuel (where tritium is obtained from neutron reactions on lithium). A volume of seawater equal to the top meter of the Earth's oceans would yield enough fuel to supply DT fusion reactors for thousands of years of electricity production at today's rate of usage. The two primary approaches to developing fusion are magnetic confinement fusion, reviewed in the January issue of PHYSICS TODAY, and inertial confinement fusion, 1 reviewed in this article and the article by William J. Hogan, Roger Bangerter and Gerald L. Kulcinski on page 42. Significant elements of the work presented here were carried out under classified Department of Energy programs and have been only recently declassified.

The system configuration is presented along with the status of its construction and the plans for system activation. The system utilizes rod and disk amplifiers and frequency tripling to produce UV pulses which are smoothed using phase conversion and smoothing by spectral dispersion. Dual driver lines will feed the propagation of two co\u2010axial beams, which have different pulse widths and occupy different portions of the laser aperture. The laser system will be completed in November 1994 and the target area in March 1995.",

Fusion 41, B39 (1999)]. The ignition design consists of a cryogenic deuterium\u2013tritium (DT) shell contained within a very thin CH shell. To maintain shell integrity during the implosion, the target is placed on an isentrope approximately three times that of Fermi-degenerate DT (\u03b1=3). One-dimensional studies show that the ignition design is robust. Two-dimensional simulations examine the effects on target performance due to laser imprint, power imbalance, and inner- and outer-target-surface roughness. Results from these studies indicate that the capsule gain can be scaled to the ice\/vapor surface deformation at the end of the acceleration stage of the implosion. The physical reason for gain reduction as a function of increasing nonuniformities is examined \u2026",
