            "Graphene has attracted worldwide interest since its experimental discovery 1, 2, but the preparation of large-area, continuous graphene film on SiO 2\/Si wafers, free from growth-related morphological defects or transfer-induced cracks and folds, remains a formidable challenge 3. Growth of graphene by chemical vapour deposition on Cu foils 4, 5, 6, 7 has emerged as a powerful technique owing to its compatibility with industrial-scale roll-to-roll technology 6. However, the polycrystalline nature and microscopic roughness of Cu foils means that such roll-to-roll transferred films are not devoid of cracks and folds 6, 7. High-fidelity transfer or direct growth of high-quality graphene films on arbitrary substrates is needed to enable wide-ranging applications in photonics or electronics, which include devices such as optoelectronic modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors and tunnelling barriers 3, 8, 9.

            "The success of metal-based plasmonics for manipulating light at the nanoscale has been empowered by imaginative designs and advanced nano-fabrication. However, the fundamental optical and electronic properties of elemental metals, the prevailing plasmonic media, are difficult to alter using external stimuli. This limitation is particularly restrictive in applications that require modification of the plasmonic response at sub-picosecond timescales. This handicap has prompted the search for alternative plasmonic media 1, 2, 3, with graphene emerging as one of the most capable candidates for infrared wavelengths. Here we visualize and elucidate the properties of non-equilibrium photo-induced plasmons in a high-mobility graphene monolayer 4.

A comprehensive understanding in the nonlinear, hysteretic ferroelectric gating and an effective way to control it are still absent. In this Letter, we quantitatively characterize the hysteretic ferroelectric gating using the reference of an independent background doping (n BG) provided by normal dielectric gating. More importantly, we prove that n BG can be used to control the ferroelectric gating by unidirectionally shifting the hysteretic ferroelectric doping in graphene. Utilizing this electrostatic effect, we demonstrate symmetrical bit writing in graphene-ferroelectric field-effect transistors with resistance change over 500% and reproducible no-volatile switching over 10 5 cycles.",

Utilizing this strategy, different patterns such as a Hall bar structure and a hexagonal array can be realized. Furthermore, the etching mechanism was studied by introducing graphene as an etching mask. We believe our technique opens an easy and controllable way of etching MoS2, which can be used to fabricate complex nanostructures, such as nanoribbons, quantum dots, and transistor structures.

To improve the electrical properties of CVD graphene grown on copper (Cu-CVD graphene), recent efforts have focused on increasing the grain size of such polycrystalline graphene films to 100 \u03bcm and larger. While an increase in grain size and, hence, a decrease of grain boundary density is expected to greatly enhance the device performance, here we show that the charge mobility and sheet resistance of Cu-CVD graphene is already limited within a single grain.

The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied the propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light.
