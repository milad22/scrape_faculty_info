Here we show that reheating considerations may provide additional constraints to these models. The reheating phase preceding the radiation era is modeled by an effective equation-of-state parameter w re. The canonical reheating scenario is then described by w re= 0. The simplest \u03b1= 2 models are consistent with w re= 0 for values of n s well within the current 1 \u03c3 range. Models with \u03b1= 1 or \u03b1= 2\/3 require a more exotic reheating phase, with\u2212 1\/3< w re< 0, unless n s falls above the current 1 \u03c3 range.

Strong lensing of a FRB by a lens of mass M L induces two images, separated by a typical time delay\u223c few\u00d7(M L\/30 M\u2299) msec. Considering the expected FRB detection rate by upcoming experiments, such as canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment (CHIME), of 1 0 4 FRBs per year, we should observe from tens to hundreds of repeated bursts yearly, if MACHOs in this window make up all the dark matter.

We then use Conformal Fermi Coordinates to generalize this result to scalar perturbations of arbitrary configuration and scale in a general cosmology with a mixture of fluids, but to linear order in perturbations. In this case, the separate universe conjecture holds for the isotropic part of the perturbations. The anisotropic part on the other hand is exactly captured by a tidal field in the Newtonian form.
