Mean trough imatinib plasma levels were significantly higher in the group with complete cytogenetic response (56 patients) than in the group without (12 patients; P = .03) and higher in the group with major molecular response (MMR) than in the group without (34 patients [1452 \u00b1 649 ng\/mL] versus 34 patients [869 \u00b1 427 ng\/mL]; P < .001). Regarding trough imatinib plasma levels and their discrimination potential for MMR, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.775, with best sensitivity (77%) and specificity (71%) at a plasma threshold of 1002 ng\/mL. Therefore, monitoring of imatinib plasma levels could be very useful for the \u2026",

Methods \u2007All patients admitted to an internal medicine ward over 6 months were evaluated to identify serious adverse reactions. The number of drug classes on admission or at the time of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) was counted. Excess ADR\u2010related hospital stay was computed using a) raw excess duration of hospital stay, b) correction of duration of hospital stay by age, sex, and number of drug classes, and c) estimation by investigator of excess hospital stay.  Results \u2007Three hundred and twenty\u2010nine patients were evaluated: 212 male, 117 female, mean age 57.2 (males: 52.2, females: 66.2 (P<0.05)), range 17\u201395 years.

General practitioners had to assess patient handling of their usual inhaler device with the help of a checklist established for each inhaler          model, from the package leaflet. Seventy-six percent of patients made at least one error with pMDI compared to 49-55% with breath-actuated \u2026",
