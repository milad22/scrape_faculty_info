            "Assessing the life cycle of a specific sanitary pad, MakaPads, in Uganda defines unique and vital measurements of social equity, especially for women laborers. A combined approach of social life cycle assessment, SLCA, and environmental life cycle assessment, ELCA, has been utilized to determine sanitary pads' social equity and environmental impacts. The development of the MakaPads product is an example of a design by Africans for Africans; whereas Libresse is an example of a European-designed product used by Africans. The ELCA and SLCA of both Libresse pads and MakaPads include the stages of raw material extraction, energy production, assembly, transport to or within Uganda, and incineration; and the contextualized economic costs of sanitary pads and income generation from the MakaPads factories. Two SLCA quantifiable characteristics that distinguish MakaPads from imported pads \u2026",

            "Optimal design of an electrical microgrid and sizing of its components seeks to balance capital investment with expected operational cost while meeting performance requirements. Calculating operational cost requires scheduling each microgrid component over some time period (dispatching) for each design evaluated. Heuristic or rule-based dispatch strategies typically consider only single time instances and are computationally efficient but do not include scheduling energy storage for future time periods. In this paper, we propose to optimize microgrid designs using forward-looking optimal dispatch for future energy storage planning. We present a case study of an \u2018islanded\u2019 military base microgrid with renewable and non-renewable electricity generation, battery storage, and plug-in vehicles with electrical export power capability. The optimal design and forward-looking dispatch strategy are compared to results \u2026",

            "Increasing energy security and reliability concerns are intensifying the interest in microgrids. In this setting, design optimization is vital to achieve a reliable infrastructure without overbuilding. This paper considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal design of a conceptual, autonomous military microgrid. This microgrid comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle incorporating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal component sizing. To this end, controllers are first designed based on the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered and its impact on regulation \u2026",

            "We demonstrate the use of model predictive control (MPC) for a microgrid with plug-in vehicles. A predictive model is developed based on a hub model of the microgrid, and the control is optimized for minimum generator fuel usage. A variety of horizons and levels of prediction error are used in the optimization. A new method to model expected load and error is presented based on radial basis functions. Results show that for a given prediction horizon, as the level of prediction error increases, the amount of fuel used increases. Results also show that in some cases there is little benefit in extending the prediction horizon. While an extended prediction horizon does result in increased use of battery storage, this does not necessarily produce significant decreases in fuel usage. This result is analyzed and explained in terms of battery charging and discharging limitations.",

            "Fuel delivery to forward operating bases (FOBs) in Afghanistan and Iraq is problematic. Fuel in transit requires personnel and equipment for storage, handling, transport, and protection. More importantly, attacks to fuel convoys accounted for more than 50% and 30% of casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq respectively during 2009. Therefore, reducing fuel consumption at FOBs will translate directly into reduced casualties. Photovoltaic (PV) energy technologies could reduce fuel consumed at FOBs for electricity generation, thus reducing supply chain burdens. Current approaches to microgrid optimization are solely concerned with fuel consumed at the FOB itself during operation (i.e. running diesel generators). This point-of-use energy analysis fails to consider the supply chain implications.

Together the world is facing the daunting task of averting an energy crisis in developed countries and facing energy crises in developing countries. This thesis explores the importance of energy crises: from the past, current, and future. The first part entails arguing that the United States is not on a pathway to prevent an energy crisis based on an analysis of 1986 and 2004 niche and status-quo manufacturing of light-duty vehicles. The second part answers the question of what an energy crisis looks like by exploring and investigating current electrical energy crises in Fort Portal, Uganda. This part used both anthropological and physics education empowerment research to co-design and build for various energy crisis situations in hospitals, schools, and businesses all from locally available materials and expertise.
