            "Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO3, is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric \u2026",

            "A plane-wave basis has great advantages for many calculations in the physics solids. To apply this basis to a wider class of materials, the atomic characteristic of a pseudopotential is identified which leads to rapid convergence in the solid, and a new method for generating pseudopotentials optimized according to this criterion is shown. As a test case, an ab initio plane-wave basis determination of the structural properties of fcc copper is performed. The results indicate that these optimized pseudopotentials will facilitate study of transition metals and first-row nonmetals.",

The authors introduce the current state of development in the application of ferroelectric thin films for electronic devices and discuss the physics relevant for the performance and failure of these devices. Following this the review covers the enormous progress that has been made in the first-principles computational approach to understanding ferroelectrics. The authors then discuss in detail the important role that strain plays in determining the properties of epitaxial thin ferroelectric films. Finally, this review ends with a look at the emerging possibilities for nanoscale ferroelectrics, with particular emphasis on ferroelectrics in nonconventional nanoscale geometries.",

Measurements include complete crystal structure analysis at 5 K by powder neutron diffraction, electron microscopy study of the oxygen ordering, and magnetic measurements of the superconducting transitions, with particular attention to the transition widths. The results show for the first time that the 90 K and 60 K plateaus in Tc as a function of oxygen stoichiometry are associated with plateaus in the effective valence of the plane coppers. We also correlate the disappearance of superconductivity for x < 6.5 with an abrupt transfer of negative charge into the CuO2 planes. We propose that different ordering schemes of oxygen have different characteristic Tc's between 90 and 60 K.",
