These data are well described by simple photoionization models, with the gas highly ionized (n H II\/n H gsim 99%) by the extragalactic ultraviolet background. Scaling by estimates for the virial radius, R vir, we show that the ionization state (tracked by the dimensionless ionization parameter, U) increases with distance from the host galaxy. The ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profile n H=(10\u20134.2\u00b10.25)(R\/R vir)\u20130.8\u00b10.3. Our derived gas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictions from standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium with a hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale \u2026",

We argue that spatial variations in the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains can explain these local variations in the observed gas\u2010phase D\/H ratios. We present a variable deuterium depletion model that naturally explains the constant measured values of D\/H inside the Local Bubble, the wide range of gas\u2010phase D\/H ratios observed in the intermediate regime [ \u201320.7], and the low gas\u2010phase D\/H ratios observed at larger hydrogen column densities.

We compare the column densities of weakly ionized metal species (eg, O II, Si II, Mg II) to N H I in the strongest H I component of each absorber.
