The Belle detector is configured around a 1.5 T superconducting solenoid and iron structure surrounding the KEK-B beams at the Tsukuba interaction region. B-meson decay vertices are measured by a silicon vertex detector situated just outside of a cylindrical beryllium beam pipe. Charged particle tracking is performed by a wire drift chamber (CDC). Particle identification is provided by dE\/dx measurements in CDC, aerogel threshold Cherenkov counter and time-of-flight counter placed radially outside of CDC.

This feature can be described by a Breit-Wigner parametrization with properties that are consistent with the Y (4008) state that was previously reported by Belle. In a study of Y (4260)\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 decays, a structure is observed in the M (\u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8) mass spectrum with 5.2 \u03c3 significance, with mass M=(3894.5\u00b16.6\u00b14.5) MeV\/c 2 and width \u0393=(63\u00b124\u00b126) MeV\/c 2, where the errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. This structure can be interpreted as a new charged charmoniumlike state.",
