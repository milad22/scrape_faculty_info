            "Vibrational spectra for a single molecule adsorbed on a solid surface have been obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Inelastic electron tunneling spectra for an isolated acetylene (C2H2) molecule adsorbed on the copper (100) surface showed an increase in the tunneling conductance at 358 millivolts, resulting from excitation of the C-H stretch mode. An isotopic shift to 266 millivolts was observed for deuterated acetylene (C2D2). Vibrational microscopy from spatial imaging of the inelastic tunneling channels yielded additional data to further distinguish and characterize the two isotopes. Single-molecule vibrational analysis should lead to better understanding and control of surface chemistry at the atomic level.",

The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with its unmatched spatial resolution and versatility literally allows us to touch atoms and molecules one at a time and to carry out experiments which previously were only imagined. One of the great attributes of the STM is that it provides a real space view of the individual molecules and the atomic landscape of their environment, thus removing many of the uncertainties surrounding the nature of the system under study. Combining its imaging, manipulation, spectroscopic characterization, and chemical modification capabilities, the STM has enabled direct visualization of chemistry by revealing the fundamental properties of atoms and molecules and their interactions with each other and the \u2026",

            "The reversible rotation of a single isolated acetylene molecule between two diagonal sites on the Cu (100) surface at 8 K was induced and monitored with tunneling electrons from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Excitation of the C\u2014H (C\u2014D) stretch mode of C 2 H 2 (C 2 D 2) at 358 meV (266 meV) led to a 10-fold (60-fold) increase in the rotation rate. This increase is attributed to energy transfer from the C\u2014H (C\u2014D) stretch mode to the hindered rotational motion of the molecule. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy with the STM provides the energies of the stretch modes and allows a quantitative determination of the inelastic tunneling and coupling probabilities.",

The differential conductance spectra display series of equally spaced features, which are attributed to vibronic states of individual molecules. The coupling of the electron current to the vibronic modes was observed to depend on the structures of the adsorbed molecules. Vibronic features were not observed for molecules adsorbed on the bare NiAl (110) surface due to spectral broadening.",
