It is the first time that P. stutzeri is reported to process the capability for phenanthrene degradation. The strain was isolated from soil samples contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-containing waste from an oil refinery field in Shanghai, China. Strain P sp. ZP2 can utilize naphthalene, phenanthrene and Tween 80 as its sole carbon source and can degrade phenanthrene very fast, 6 days for 96% phenanthrene at 250 ppm concentration. The optimal growth conditions of strain ZP2 was determined to be at pH 8.0, 37 \u00b0C, respectively. The results also indicate that strain ZP2 can remove more than 90% of phenanthrene at any concentrations ranged from 250 to 1000 ppm in \u2026",

Twelve sets of biochar were obtained by treating four phytoremediation plants, Salix rosthornii Seemen, Thalia dealbata, Vetiveria zizanioides, and Phragmites sp., sequentially through pyrolysis at 500 \u00b0C in a N2 environment, and under different temperatures (500, 600, and 700 \u00b0C) in a CO2 environment. The cation exchange capacity and specific surface area of biochar varied with both plant species and pyrolysis temperature. The magnesium (Mg) content of biochar derived from T. dealbata (TC) was obviously higher than that of the other plant biochars. This biochar also had the highest sorption capacity for phosphate and ammonium. In terms of biomass yields, adsorption capacity, and energy cost, T. dealbata biochar produced at 600 \u00b0C (TC600) is the most promising sorbent for \u2026",

This decreased the equivalent surface loading of NO3\u2013 to 0.34 \u00b1 0.04\u20130.53 \u00b1 0.03 g N\/m2-day for the lag MBfR, in which ClO4\u2013 was reduced to nondetectable. SO42\u2013 reduction was eliminated without compromising full ClO4\u2013 reduction using a higher flow rate that gave an equivalent NO3\u2013 surface loading of 0.94 \u00b1 0.05 g N\/m2-day in the lead MBfR and 0.53 \u00b1 0.03 g N\/m2-day in the lag MBfR.
