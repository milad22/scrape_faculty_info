The analysis focuses on qui tam enforcement under the Civil False Claims Act, because a remarkable body of empirical data demonstrates the expansive role private qui tam relators are playing in enforcing Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse laws. The Article further focuses on the application of these laws to the pharmaceutical industry. This focus is enlightening because the Government, as well as private enforcers have recently targeted this industry so that emerging legal trends in private enforcement ars readily evident.

            "Offers an innovative plan to eliminate inequalities in American health care and save the lives they endanger Over 84,000 black and brown lives are needlessly lost each year due to health disparities: the unfair, unjust, and avoidable differences between the quality and quantity of health care provided to Americans who are members of racial and ethnic minorities and care provided to whites. Health disparities have remained stubbornly entrenched in the American health care system\u2014and in Just Medicine Dayna Bowen Matthew finds that they principally arise from unconscious racial and ethnic biases held by physicians, institutional providers, and their patients. Implicit bias is the single most important determinant of health and health care disparities. Because we have missed this fact, the money we spend on training providers to become culturally competent, expanding wellness education programs and community health centers, and even expanding access to health insurance will have only a modest effect on reducing health disparities. We will continue to utterly fail in the effort to eradicate health disparities unless we enact strong, evidence-based legal remedies that accurately address implicit and unintentional forms of discrimination, to replace the weak, tepid, and largely irrelevant legal remedies currently available. Our continued failure to fashion an effective response that purges the effects of implicit bias from American health care, Matthew argues, is unjust and morally untenable. In this book, she unites medical, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology research on implicit bias and health disparities with her own expertise in civil rights \u2026",

            "With the rise in health care costs, attempts to control these expenditures have been proposed by Congress, state legislatures, and perhaps most notably, employers. Using a reverse agency model, Professor Matthew explores the role of health insurance in the employeremployee relationship and describes how this reverse agency model identifies potential conflicts of interests among the parties. For example, employers seek to minimize operating costs while maximizing profit, which is a goal that may interfere with the employer's role as agent when obtaining health insurance for its employees. Professor Matthew finds that employees have little actual control over the selection of health care benefits, thus resulting in a compromise of the traditional element of continuous control in an agency relationship. These problems often lead to an acrimonious workplace, which is becoming increasingly uninsured due to rising \u2026",

Moreover, the article demonstrates that by addressing identifiable harms which informed consent law now causes to racial, religious, and ethnic minority patients, the law may also better address many of the concerns legal commentators have been discussing for years with only majority patients in mind.
