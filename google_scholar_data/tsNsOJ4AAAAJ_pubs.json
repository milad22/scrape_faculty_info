We also study how the structures of and quantification statistics for RPs vary with the embedding parameters. By considering the distribution of the main diagonal line segments for chaotic systems, we relate some of the known statistics for the quantification of a RP to the Lyapunov exponent. This consideration enables us to introduce new ways of quantifying the diagonal line segments. Furthermore, we categorize recurrence points into two classes. A number of new quantities are identified which may be useful for the detection of nonstationarity in a time series, especially for the detection of a bifurcation sequence.

To effectively extract desired information from measured time series, it is important to preprocess data to reduce noise. In this Letter, we propose an adaptive denoising algorithm. Using chaotic Lorenz data and calculating root-mean-square-error, Lyapunov exponent, and correlation dimension, we show that our adaptive algorithm more effectively reduces noise in the chaotic Lorenz system than wavelet denoising with three different thresholding choices. We further analyze an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in sleep apnea and show that the adaptive algorithm again more effectively reduces the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other types of noise contaminated in EEG than wavelet approaches.",

We find that noise can indeed induce chaos. However, this is not associated with the main 2 n cascade. We identify three basic conditions for noise to induce chaos.

Second, we show how to obtain the fundamental error bounds by using bifurcation analysis based on probabilistic models of unreliable gates. Third, we describe the notion of random interwoven redundancy. Finally, we compare the reliabilities of quadded and random interwoven structures by using a simulation-based approach.

            "Due to the ubiquity of time series with long-range correlation in many areas of science and engineering, analysis and modeling of such data is an important problem. While the field seems to be mature, three major issues have not been satisfactorily resolved.(i) Many methods have been proposed to assess long-range correlation in time series. Under what circumstances do they yield consistent results?(ii) The mathematical theory of long-range correlation concerns the behavior of the correlation of the time series for very large times. A measured time series is finite, however. How can we relate the fractal scaling break at a specific time scale to important parameters of the data?(iii) An important technique in assessing long-range correlation in a time series is to construct a random walk process from the data, under the assumption that the data are like a stationary noise process.
