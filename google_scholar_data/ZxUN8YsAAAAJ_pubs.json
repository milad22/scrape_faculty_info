Variational analyses of large matrices of correlation functions computed using operator constructions resembling \u03c0 \u03c0, K K and q q, in several moving frames and several lattice irreducible representations, lead to discrete energy spectra from which scattering amplitudes are extracted. In the elastic \u03c0 \u03c0 scattering region we obtain a detailed energy dependence for the phase shift, corresponding to a \u03c1 resonance, and we extend the analysis into the coupled-channel K K region for the first time, finding a small coupling between the channels.",

The formalism allows one to determine the phase shifts and mixing parameters of \u03c0 \u03c0\u2212 K K isosinglet coupled channels directly from lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the extension to more than two channels is straightforward and present the result for three channels.

This condition gives a relation between the finite volume spectrum and infinite volume scattering amplitudes. The quantization condition presented is an integral equation that in general must be solved numerically. However, for systems with an attractive two-body force that supports a two-body bound state, a diboson, and for energies below the diboson breakup, the quantization condition reduces to the well-known L\u00fcscher formula with exponential corrections in volume that scale with the diboson binding momentum. To accurately determine infinite volume phase shifts, it is necessary to extrapolate the phase shifts obtained from the L\u00fcscher formula for the boson-diboson system to the infinite volume limit.

            "The vast majority of hadrons observed in nature are not stable under the strong interaction; rather they are resonances whose existence is deduced from enhancements in the energy dependence of scattering amplitudes. The study of hadron resonances offers a window into the workings of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the low-energy nonperturbative region, and in addition many probes of the limits of the electroweak sector of the standard model consider processes which feature hadron resonances. From a theoretical standpoint, this is a challenging field: the same dynamics that binds quarks and gluons into hadron resonances also controls their decay into lighter hadrons, so a complete approach to QCD is required. Presently, lattice QCD is the only available tool that provides the required nonperturbative evaluation of hadron observables.
