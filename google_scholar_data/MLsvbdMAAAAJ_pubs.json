            "Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions have become a powerful tool in organic synthesis. 1 Today, there are numerous applications of palladium catalysts in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and also advanced materials both on laboratory and industrial scale. The importance of palladium catalysis was underlined by the 2010 Nobel Price to R. Heck, A. Suzuki, and E. Negishi for their pioneering work in this field. 2 Among all the palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions, carbonylation reactions also have experienced impressive improvements since the first work of R. Heck and co-workers in 1974. 3 The advantages of carbonylations are (i) it is the most potent methodology in the synthesis of carbonylcontaining chemicals, which increases the carbon number at the same time, and (ii) carbon monoxide (CO) can be used as an inexpensive and readily available C1 source, which is also in agreement \u2026",

Since the first applications in industry 80 years ago, academic and industrial laboratories have broadly explored CO\u2019s use in chemical reactions. Today organic chemists routinely employ CO in organic chemistry to synthesize all kinds of carbonyl compounds. Despite all these achievements and a century of carbonylation catalysis, many important research questions and challenges remain.Notably, apart from academic developments, industry applies carbonylation reactions with CO on bulk scale. In fact, today the largest applications of homogeneous catalysis (regarding scale) are carbonylation reactions, especially hydroformylations.
