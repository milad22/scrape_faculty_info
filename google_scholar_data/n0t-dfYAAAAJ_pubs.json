An optical readout was used to simultaneously measure deflections of all microcantilevers in the array. The fabricated arrays had an average noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) and a response time of 1.5K and 6ms, respectively. Some microcantilevers in the array exhibited NETD values below 500mK, approaching our theoretical prediction of 151mK. A unique and valuable feature of the implemented approach is its straightforward scalability to higher resolution arrays, without progressively growing complexity and cost.",

Measurement showed that the fabricated absorber has nearly 90% absorption at 3.8 THz. A responsivity of 0.1\u00b0\/\u03bcW and a time constant of 14 ms were observed.

Materials with highly dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion, namely, Al and SiO2, were used to form folded bimaterial regions. This approach improved the detector sensitivity by 12 times compared to SiNx-based detectors of similar shape and size. Two types of structural SiO2 layers were investigated: thermally grown and plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor-deposited SiO2. Fabrication of the detector arrays relied on a straightforward process flow that involved three photolithography steps and no wet etching.
