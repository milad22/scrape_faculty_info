            "Thermoelectric devices that utilize the Seebeck effect convert heat flow into electrical energy and are highly desirable for the development of portable, solid state, passively powered electronic systems. The conversion efficiencies of such devices are quantified by the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT), which is proportional to the ratio of a device\u2019s electrical conductance to its thermal conductance. In this paper, a recently fabricated two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor called phosphorene (monolayer black phosphorus) is assessed for its thermoelectric capabilities. First-principles and model calculations reveal not only that phosphorene possesses a spatially anisotropic electrical conductance, but that its lattice thermal conductance exhibits a pronounced spatial-anisotropy as well. The prominent electrical and thermal conducting directions are orthogonal to one another, enhancing the ratio of these \u2026",

Effects of single functional groups and their various combinations on the electronic and structural properties are investigated. It is found that single functional groups can induce interesting electronic bound states in graphene. Detailed energetics analysis shows that epoxy and hydroxyl groups tend to aggregate on the graphene plane. Investigations of possible ordered structures with different compositions of epoxy and hydroxyl groups show that the hydroxyl groups could form chainlike structures stabilized by the hydrogen bonding between these groups, in close proximity of the epoxy groups. Our calculations indicate that the energy gap of graphene oxide can be tuned in a large range of 0\u20134.0 eV, suggesting that functionalization of graphene by oxidation will significantly \u2026",

These modes are of various symmetries and exhibit different sensitivities to either Raman or infrared measurements (or both). The splitting is found to be 5 cm\u2212 1 for bilayer and 2\u20135 cm\u2212 1 for trilayer graphene. The interlayer coupling is estimated to be about 2 cm\u2212 1.

Magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) defines the stability of magnetization in a specific direction with respect to the crystal lattice and is an important parameter for nanoscale applications. In this work we apply the density functional theory to study the strain dependence of MAE in 2D monolayer chromium trihalides Cr X 3 (with X= Cl, Br, and I). Detailed calculations of their energetics, atomic structures, and electronic structures under the influence of a biaxial strain \u025b have been carried out. It is found that all three compounds exhibit ferromagnetic ordering at the ground state (with \u025b= 0), and upon applying a compressive strain, phase transition to the antiferromagnetic state occurs.

It is found that as the diameter decreases, the energy band gaps are distinctly enlarged due to the confinement effect. The valence-band maximum moves down while the conduction-band minimum moves up compared with the bulk. By using the many-body perturbation theory within the G W approximation, we have also investigated the self-energy correction to the energy band gaps. Our calculational results show that, although the band gap values strongly depend on both the diameter and orientation, the G W corrections are mainly dependent on diameter and less sensitive to the growth orientation. The effective mass as a function of diameter is also discussed.",

The emergence of these interlayer phonon modes indicate that the ReS2 layers are coupled and orderly stacked. Whereas the interlayer breathing modes behave similarly to those in other 2D layered crystals, the shear modes exhibit distinctive behavior due to the in-plane lattice distortion. In particular, the two shear modes in bilayer ReS2 are nondegenerate and clearly resolved in the Raman spectrum, in contrast to the doubly degenerate shear modes in other 2D materials.

Despite the similar honeycomb atomic arrangement and linear-band dispersion, the EPC matrix-element squares of the \u0393-E g and K-A 1 modes in silicene are only about 50% of those in graphene. However, the smaller Fermi velocity in silicene compensates for this reduction by providing a larger joint electronic density of states near the Dirac point, giving rise to comparable phonon linewidths. We predict that Kohn anomalies associated with these two optical modes are significant in silicene.
