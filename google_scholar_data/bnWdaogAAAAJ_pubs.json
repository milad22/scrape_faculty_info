However, it remains unknown how soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to be biased low in z owing to selection effects 1, as confirmed by recent findings of systems with redshifts as high as\u223c 5 (refs 2\u20134). Here we report the identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z= 6.34 through a submillimetre colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically \u2026",

During these epochs, early stars and black holes heated and ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain the timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the first galaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of heating.

The result is a new 2\u03c3 upper limit on \u0394 2 (k) of (22.4 mK) 2 in the range  at z= 8.4. This represents a three-fold improvement over the previous best upper limit.

            "Using the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array, we have conducted a blind redshift survey in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window for 26 strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected with the South Pole Telescope. The sources were selected to have S 1.4 mm> 20 mJy and a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio (S 843 MHz< 6 mJy) or far-infrared counterparts (S 100 \u03bcm< 1 Jy, S 60 \u03bcm< 200 mJy). We robustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshifted emission lines of 12 CO, 13 CO, C I, H 2 O, and H 2 O+. We find one or more spectral features in 23 sources yielding a~ 90% detection rate for this survey; in 12 of these sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only a single line. For the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshift degeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or \u2026",

            "The six-meter Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in Chile was built to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at arcminute angular scales. We are building a new polarization sensitive receiver for ACT (ACTPol). ACTPol will characterize the gravitational lensing of the CMB and aims to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses with ~ 0.05 eV precision, the running of the spectral index of inflation-induced fluctuations, and the primordial helium abundance to better than 1 %. Our observing fields will overlap with the SDSS BOSS survey at optical wavelengths, enabling a variety of cross-correlation science, including studies of the growth of cosmic structure from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations of clusters of galaxies as well as independent constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses. We describe the science objectives and the initial receiver design.",
