In this context, quantum-dot-based spin qubits could have substantial advantages over other types of qubit owing to their potential for all-electrical operation and ability to be integrated at high density onto an industrial platform 3, 4, 5. Initialization, readout and single-and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in various quantum-dot-based qubit representations 6, 7, 8, 9.

The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that it minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si\/SiGe quantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by resonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from a local micromagnet 2, and the spin state is read out in the single-shot mode 3. Electron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we attribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in silicon, a Ramsey decay timescale of 1 \u03bcs is observed, almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic timescales in GaAs quantum dots 4, 5, whereas gate operation \u2026",

They can be structured in the form of bulk materials, multilayer and monolayer films, polymerized vesicles, and even incorporated into inorganic host matrices to form nanocomposites. The resulting materials exhibit an array of spectacular properties, beginning most notably with dramatic chromogenic transitions that can be activated optically, thermally, chemically, and mechanically. Recent studies have shown that these transitions can even be controlled and observed at the nanometre scale. These transitions have been harnessed for the purpose of chemical and biomolecular sensors, and on a more fundamental level have led to new insights regarding chromogenic phenomena in polymers.

Performing two-qubit operations has negligible effect on other qubits in the array. Simulation results are used to translate error correction requirements into specifications for gate-voltage control electronics.

In materials integration, strain is typically tuned through the use of dislocations and elemental composition. We demonstrate a versatile method to control strain by fabricating membranes in which the final strain state is controlled by elastic strain sharing, that is, without the formation of defects. We grow Si\/SiGe layers on a substrate from which they can be released, forming nanomembranes. X-ray-diffraction measurements confirm a final strain predicted by elasticity theory. The effectiveness of elastic strain to alter electronic properties is demonstrated by low-temperature longitudinal Hall-effect measurements on a strained-silicon quantum well before and after release.

However, the multiple valleys in the silicon conduction band are potentially a serious source of decoherence for spin-based quantum-dot qubits. Only when a large energy splits these valleys do we obtain well-defined and long-lived spin states appropriate for quantum computing. Here, we show that the small valley splittings observed in previous experiments on Si\u2013SiGe heterostructures result from atomic steps at the quantum-well interface. Lateral confinement in a quantum point contact limits the electron wavefunctions to several steps, and enhances the valley splitting substantially, up to 1.5 meV.
