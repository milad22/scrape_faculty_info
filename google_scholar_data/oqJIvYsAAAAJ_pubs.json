            "The southeastern United States is experiencing rapid urban development. Consequently, Georgia's streams are experiencing hydrologic alterations from extensive development and from other land use activities such as livestock grazing and silviculture. A study was performed to assess stream hydrology within 18 watersheds ranging from 500 to 2500 ha. Study streams were first, second, or third order and hydrology was continuously monitored from 29 July 2003 to 23 September 2004 using InSitu pressure transducers. Rating curves between stream stage (i.e., water depth) and discharge were developed for each stream by correlating biweekly discharge measurements and stage data. Dependent variables were calculated from discharge data and placed into 4 categories: flow frequency (i.e., the number of times a predetermined discharge threshold is exceeded), flow magnitude (i.e., maximum and minimum \u2026",

We used gut-content analyses and an enclosure\u2013exclosure experiment to investigate the influence of both species of crayfish on sediment accumulation and benthic invertebrates. Crayfish guts contained mostly sediment and vegetative detritus. However, C. chasmodactylus guts contained significantly more detritus and animal matter than O. cristavarius guts, and O. cristavarius guts contained significantly more sediment than C. chasmodactylus guts.

Recently, stream-breeding salamanders have been observed to decrease in density in urban areas. We employed a two-step process to determine the mechanism(s) most likely responsible for salamander decline in disturbed streams. First, we conducted a 2-year survey of larval two-lined salamanders (Eurycea cirrigera) and abiotic variables among 12 streams in western Georgia, USA surrounded by land disturbed by urbanization and pasture. From these surveys we constructed hypotheses that might explain differences in observed larval salamander density among streams. A model in which increased watershed impervious surface causes an increase in spate (i.e., high water flow) frequency and magnitude, which then leads to decreased larval density had the most support \u2026",
