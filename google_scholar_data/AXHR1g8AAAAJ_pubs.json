            "With the popularity and growth of social networking, consumers often rely on the advice and recommendations from online friends when making purchase decisions. Social commerce in this regard represents a shift in consumers' thinking from inefficient individual-based consumption decisions to collaborative sharing and social shopping. In this study, we investigate social commerce from two different but interrelated angles (i.e., social shopping and social sharing). Built on the literature of social support, commitment-trust theory, and trust transfer theory, a research model was developed and empirically examined. The findings of this study demonstrated that both emotional and informational social support significantly affected consumers' trust and community commitment, which in turn exerted profound impacts on both social shopping and social sharing intention. Trust toward members also can be transferred into \u2026",

Further, utilitarian (hedonic) benefits are more influential for males (females) than for females (males) when formulating overall benefit perceptions, and perceived benefits (privacy risks) have stronger impacts on disclosure intention for males (females) than for females (males).

In this study, we regarded the use of instant messaging in team collaboration as a social behavior and examined the changing roles of social influence processes in the formation of usage we-intention (i.e. social intention). Building on the belief-desire-intention model and the social influence theory, an integrated model was developed and empirically tested using survey data collected from 482 students. The results demonstrated that desire partially mediates the effects of group norm and social identity on we-intention to use. In addition, the effect of group norm is more significant for users with lower usage experience, whereas the effect of social identity is more significant for users with higher usage experience. We believe this study provides several important implications for both research and practice.",

Specifically, trust in web services and two relationship-relevant factors namely functional consistency and perceived entitativity are proposed as the predictors of trust in mobile services. A field survey with 235 mobile eWOM services users is conducted to test the research model and hypotheses.

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been proved to be an effective tool to solve various kinds of optimization problems. However, for the basic PSO, the updating strategy is mainly aims to learn the global best, and it often suffers premature convergence as well as performs poorly on many complex optimization problems, especially for multimodal problems. A hybrid PSO algorithm which employs an adaptive learning strategy (ALPSO) is developed in this paper. In ALPSO, we employ a self-learning based candidate generation strategy to ensure the exploration ability, and a competitive learning based prediction strategy to guarantee exploitation of the algorithm.

The research model was tested with 240 valid responses among Chinese MIM users. The results show that fatigue with incumbent MIM and subjective norm have significant positive effects on switching intention, while inertia negatively affects switching intention. In addition, affective commitment, switching costs and habit are found to be significant to inertia. This study sheds light on the switching behavior of MIM users, and helps explain the key determinants of switching intention of MIM users.
