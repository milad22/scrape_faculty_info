            "We report transient photocurrent measurements on solar cell structures based on dye-sensitized, porous TiO2 films filled with a liquid electrolyte. The measurements are interpreted as ambipolar diffusion; under most measurement conditions, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient is dominated by electrons diffusing in the TiO2 matrix. We report a strong dependence of the ambipolar diffusion coefficient upon the photoexcitation density, as has been proposed previously. The coefficients vary from 10-8 cm2 s-1 at low density to 10-4 cm2 s-1 for densities of 1018 cm-3. At a specified photoexcitation density, ambipolar diffusion coefficients measured using weak laser pulses and optical bias are about 10 times larger than coefficients measured using large-intensity laser pulses. We describe trapping models for these effects based on an exponential distribution (T0 = 650 K) of electron trap levels in TiO2. We infer an electron \u2026",

            "We propose an experimental procedure for testing the Einstein relation for carrier drift and diffusion in semiconductors exhibiting non-Gaussian or dispersive transport. We present corresponding hole time-of-flight and steady-state photocarrier grating measurements in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a\u2212 S i: H). For a range of mobilities 10\u2212 5\u201310\u2212 2 cm 2\/V s we find that our estimates of hole diffusion are approximately twice as large as predicted by the Einstein relation and the mobility measurements. We consider the deviation to represent an upper bound to any true failure of the Einstein relation for hole transport in a\u2212 S i: H.",
