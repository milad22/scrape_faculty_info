In both phases, the conduction band minimum is at the zone center while the valance band maximum is rather flat in the k space. The calculated electron effective mass m e*\u2215 m 0 comes out to be 0.342 and 0.276 for \u03b2\u2212 Ga 2 O 3 and \u03b1\u2212 Ga 2 O 3, respectively. The dynamic dielectric function, reflectance, and energy-loss function for both phases are reported for a wide energy range of 0\u201350 eV. The subtle differences in electronic and optical properties can be attributed to the higher symmetry, coordination number of Ga atoms, and packing density in \u03b1\u2212 Ga 2 O 3 relative to that in \u03b2\u2212 Ga 2 O 3.",

Our calculations show that free-standing \u03b1 and \u03b2 allotropes of antimonene are stable and semiconducting. The \u03b1-Sb has a puckered structure with two atomic sublayers and \u03b2-Sb has a buckled hexagonal lattice. The calculated Raman spectra and STM images have distinct features thus facilitating characterization of both allotropes. The \u03b2-Sb has nearly isotropic mechanical properties, whereas \u03b1-Sb shows strongly anisotropic characteristics. An indirect\u2013direct band gap transition is expected with moderate tensile strains applied to the monolayers, which opens up the possibility of their applications in optoelectronics.",

The calculated results predict these zinc-based spinel oxides to be direct-gap materials. The direct gap at is found to be 4.11 eV for ZnAl 2 O 4 and 2.79 eV for ZnGa 2 O 4. With reference to the calculated band gap of 5.36 eV for MgAl 2 O 4, the systematic decrease in the gap is attributed to the presence of 3d orbitals of Zn and Ga and the associated pd hybridization in the upper valence band of zinc aluminate and gallate. Comparison of the contour maps of the electron localization function of ZnAl 2 O 4 and ZnGa 2 O 4 with that of MgAl 2 O 4 clearly shows the bonding to be less ionic in the zinc-based spinel oxides.

In this paper, we provide an atomic level understanding of the stability of phosphorene in terms of its interaction with O 2 and H 2 O. The results based on density functional theory together with first principles molecular dynamics calculations show that O 2 could the spontaneously dissociate on phosphorene at room temperature. H 2 O will not strongly interact with pristine phosphorene, however, an exothermic reaction could occur if phosphorene is first oxidized. The pathway of oxidation first, followed by exothermic reaction with water is the most likely route for the chemical degradation of phosphorene-based devices in air.",

The band structure of this phase is calculated by the ab initio correlated Hartree-Fock method. Not surprisingly, the band structure of rocksalt ZnO is very similar to that of CdO, which has the same crystal structure; we present a band-structure calculation for CdO, which we believe is more accurate than any in the literature. A hallmark of these band structures is that the valence-band maximum is not at the center of the Brillouin zone, in contrast to the situation in tetrahedrally coordinated II-VI semiconductors. We confirm by direct calculation that this peculiarity of the band structure is a consequence of the hybridization of oxygen 2p-derived orbitals with Zn 3d or Cd 4d states, combined \u2026",
