Shifts in hysteresis loops of up to 248Oe were observed in the 5T field cooled samples. The observed exchange bias behavior in Ni50Mn25+xSb25\u2212x is attributed to the coexistence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange interactions in the system. Such behavior is an addition to the multifunctional properties of the Ni50Mn25+xSb25\u2212x Heusler alloy system.",

The power to the Mo target was kept constant, while power to the MoS2 and Ag targets was varied to obtain different coating compositions. The coatings consisted of Mo2N, with silver and\/or sulfur additions of up to approximately 24 at%. Coating chemistry and crystal structure were evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed the presence of tetragonal Mo2N and cubic Ag phases. The MoS2 phase was detected from XPS analysis and was likely present as an amorphous inclusion based on the absence of characteristic XRD peaks. The tribological properties of the coatings were investigated in dry sliding at room temperature \u2026",
