            "This paper presents the boundary conditions needed for drift-diffusion models to treat interfaces with spin-orbit coupling. Using these boundary conditions for heavy-metal\/ferromagnet bilayers, solutions of the drift-diffusion equations agree with solutions of the spin-dependent Boltzmann equation and allow for a much simpler interpretation of the results. A key feature of these boundary conditions is their ability to capture the role that in-plane electric fields have in the generation of spin currents that flow perpendicularly to the interface. The generation of these spin currents is a direct consequence of the effect of interfacial spin-orbit coupling on interfacial scattering. In heavy-metal\/ferromagnet bilayers, these spin currents provide an important mechanism for the creation of dampinglike and fieldlike torques; they also lead to possible reinterpretations of experiments in which interfacial contributions to spin torques are \u2026",

For applications, it is important that these torques switch films with perpendicular magnetizations without an external magnetic field 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. One suggested approach 15 to enable such switching uses magnetic trilayers in which the torque on the top magnetic layer can be manipulated by changing the magnetization of the bottom layer. Spin currents generated in the bottom magnetic layer or its interfaces transit the spacer layer and exert a torque on the top magnetization. Here we demonstrate field-free switching in such structures and show that its dependence on the bottom-layer magnetization is not consistent with the anticipated bulk effects 15. We describe a mechanism for spin-current generation 16, 17 at the interface between the bottom layer and the spacer layer, which gives \u2026",

This enables a proper treatment of spin transport at interfaces between a ferromagnet and a heavy-metal nonmagnet. This generalized approach describes spin transport in terms of drops in spin and charge accumulations across the interface (as in the standard approach), but additionally includes the responses from in-plane electric fields and offsets in spin accumulations. A key finding is that in-plane electric fields give rise to spin accumulations and spin currents that can be polarized in any direction, generalizing the Rashba-Edelstein and spin Hall effects. The spin accumulations exert torques on the magnetization at the interface when they are misaligned from the magnetization. The additional out-of-plane spin currents exert torques via the spin-transfer mechanism on the \u2026",

Reduced symmetry in these ferromagnets enables a wide variety of such spin currents.

Intrinsic spin currents are not subject to dephasing, enabling their spin polarizations to be misaligned with the magnetization and allowing for the magnetization-independent spin Hall effect. The spin Hall conductivity and spin anomalous Hall conductivities of transition-metal ferromagnets are comparable to those found in heavy metals, opening different avenues for efficient spin current generation in spintronic devices.",

Here, we report the observation of a counterpart of the AHE that we term the anomalous spin\u2013orbit torque (ASOT), wherein an electric current parallel to the magnetization generates opposite spin\u2013orbit torques on the surfaces of the magnetic film. We interpret the ASOT as being due to a spin-Hall-like current generated with an efficiency of 0.053\u00b10.003 in Ni 80 Fe 20, comparable to the spin Hall angle of Pt 7.
