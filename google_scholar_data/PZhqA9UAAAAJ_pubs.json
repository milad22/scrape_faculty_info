            "  Movement is influenced by landscape structure, configuration and geometry, but measuring distance as perceived by animals poses technical and logistical challenges. Instead, movement is typically measured using Euclidean distance, irrespective of location or landscape structure, or is based on arbitrary cost surfaces. A recently proposed extension of spatial capture\u2010recapture (SCR) models resolves this issue using spatial encounter histories of individuals to calculate least\u2010cost paths (ecological distance: Ecology, 94, 2013, 287) thereby relaxing the Euclidean assumption. We evaluate the consequences of not accounting for movement heterogeneity when estimating abundance in highly structured landscapes, and demonstrate the value of this approach for estimating biologically realistic space\u2010use patterns and landscape connectivity.

Spatial capture\u2013recapture (SCR) represents an individual\u2010based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory.

One of the core assumptions of SCR models is that individuals possess home ranges that are spatially stationary during the sampling period. For many species, this assumption is unlikely to be met and, even for species that are typically territorial, individuals may disperse or exhibit transience at some life stages. In this paper we first conduct a simulation study to evaluate the robustness of estimators of density under ordinary SCR models when dispersal or transience is present in the population.

The immediate adoption of SCR is due to the fact that it resolves some major criticisms of traditional capture\u2013recapture methods related to heterogeneity in detectabililty, and the emergence of new technologies (e.g. camera traps, non\u2010invasive genetics) that have vastly improved our ability to collection spatially explicit observation data on individuals. However, the utility of SCR methods reaches far beyond simply convenience and data availability. SCR presents a formal statistical framework that can be used to test explicit hypotheses about core elements of population and landscape ecology, and has profound implications for how we study animal populations.
