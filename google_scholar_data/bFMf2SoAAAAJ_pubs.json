Particular attention is paid to the high-energy electron end-point region in B decay since it is crucial to a determination of the b\u2192 u weak mixing angle. It is argued that in this region the usual inclusive (\u2018\u2018quark decay\u2019\u2019) calculations are unjustified and must be replaced by explicit sums over decays of the original meson into low-mass exclusive hadronic final states.",

One of the effects we calculate gives the leading q2-dependence of the form factor of a heavey quark, which in turn dominates the q2-dependence of the form factors of bound states of the heavy quark with light quarks. This, combined with the normalization of the form factor provided by symmetry, gives us a first principles calculation of the heavy meson (or baryon) form factors in the limit of very large heavy quark mass.",

Our approach is patterned after the operator product expansion analysis of R in e+ \u2212e\u2212 annihilation and deep inelastic electroproduction. We extend the idea of an operator product expansion to a situation in which we match the physics from a T-product in the high energy theory to a set of local operators in the low energy effective heavy quark field theory. In leading order we reproduce the results of the parton model, but we can also describe the corrections systematically.

Factorization has been used in an attempt to transcribe results from model calculations of semileptonic decay rates of heavy mesons. We propose that factorization holds perturbatively in QCD, provided one looks in the appropriate kinematic regime. This is studied with the use of a novel expansion in which factorization holds in leading order, which includes all orders in the loop expansion. Our results are contrasted with large-N expansion arguments.",
