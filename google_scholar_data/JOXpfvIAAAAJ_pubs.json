            "Recently, on-chip comb generation methods based on nonlinear optical modulation in ultrahigh-quality-factor monolithic microresonators have been demonstrated, where two pump photons are transformed into sideband photons in a four-wave-mixing process mediated by Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we investigate line-by-line pulse shaping of such combs generated in silicon nitride ring resonators. We observe two distinct paths to comb formation that exhibit strikingly different time-domain behaviours. For combs formed as a cascade of sidebands spaced by a single free spectral range that spread from the pump, we are able to compress stably to nearly bandwidth-limited pulses. This indicates high coherence across the spectra and provides new data on the high passive stability of the spectral phase. For combs where the initial sidebands are spaced by multiple free spectral ranges that then fill in to give combs with \u2026",

            "Cavity quantum electrodynamics 1, the study of coherent quantum interactions between the electromagnetic field and matter inside a resonator, has received attention as both a test bed for ideas in quantum mechanics and a building block for applications in the field of quantum information processing 2. The canonical experimental system studied in the optical domain is a single alkali atom coupled to a high-finesse Fabry\u2013Perot cavity. Progress made in this system 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has recently been complemented by research involving trapped ions 6, chip-based microtoroid cavities 7, integrated microcavity-atom-chips 8, nanocrystalline quantum dots coupled to microsphere cavities 9, and semiconductor quantum dots embedded in micropillars, photonic crystals and microdisks 10, 11, 12. The last system has been of particular interest owing to its relative simplicity and scalability. Here we use a fibre taper waveguide to \u2026",

            "A technique is demonstrated which efficiently transfers light between a tapered standard single-mode optical fiber and a high-Q, ultra-small mode volume, silicon photonic crystal resonant cavity. Cavity mode quality factors of 4.7??10^4 are measured, and a total fiber-to-cavity coupling efficiency of 44% is demonstrated. Using this efficient cavity input and output channel, the steady-state nonlinear absorption and dispersion of the photonic crystal cavity is studied. Optical bistability is observed for fiber input powers as low as 250 \u00b5W, corresponding to a dropped power of 100 \u00b5W and 3 fJ of stored cavity energy. A high-density effective free-carrier lifetime for these silicon photonic crystal resonators of ~ 0.5 ns is also estimated from power dependent loss and dispersion measurements.",
