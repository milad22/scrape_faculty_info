In India older firms are found to be more productive and less profitable, whereas the larger firms are, conversely, found to be more profitable and less productive. These performance differences are explained as arising from the market-restricting industrial policies that have been followed in India over the past three decades.",

Foreign ownership is categorized according to the control exercisable at different levels of ownership. These categories are, in turn, determined by the institutional structure of the Indian environment that helps define the property rights accruing at different levels of ownership. Firms' performance is measured as return on sales and return on assets. The results show that, after controlling for a variety of firm and environment\u2010specific factors, only when property rights devolve to foreign owners, at ownership levels providing unambiguous control at 51 percent, do firms in which there is foreign ownership display relatively superior performance.",

We expect the conversion effect to be felt more strongly during earlier phases of a technology's evolution, while a strong consumption effect is felt throughout.

            "The issue of resource utilization is important in the resource\u2010based stream of work, since the ability of firms to utilize resources is a key indicator of their competitive abilities. This paper specifies why some firms might be better at utilizing resources than others. Thereafter, it demonstrates how to empirically ascertain differences in resource utilization patterns between firms using the U.S. telecommunications industry as a context. The data envelopment analysis procedure (DEA), which is a firm\u2010level resource utilization measure, is used. This procedure can be useful for the resource\u2010based approach research agenda since performance is measured in resource terms. DEA is applied to measure variations in different dimensions of resource utilization for the firms making up the local operating sector of the telecommunications industry. The use of DEA to guide empirical research and address theoretical issues within \u2026",
