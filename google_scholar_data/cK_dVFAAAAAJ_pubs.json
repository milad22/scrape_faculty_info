The Born cross section is measured to be (62.9\u00b11.9\u00b13.7) pb, consistent with the production of the Y (4260). We observe a structure at around 3.9 GeV\/c 2 in the \u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8 mass spectrum, which we refer to as the Z c (3900). If interpreted as a new particle, it is unusual in that it carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium. A fit to the \u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8 invariant mass spectrum, neglecting interference, results in a mass of (3899.0\u00b13.6\u00b14.9) MeV\/c 2 and a width of (46\u00b110\u00b120) MeV.

The search for such a state was motivated by the recent discovery by the BaBar Collaboration of a narrow state at 2.32 GeV\/c 2, the D sJ*(2317)+, that decays to D s+ \u03c0 0. Reconstructing the D s+ \u03c0 0 and D s*+ \u03c0 0 final states in CLEO data, we observe peaks in both of the corresponding reconstructed mass difference distributions, \u0394 M (D s \u03c0 0)= M (D s \u03c0 0)\u2212 M (D s) and \u0394 M (D s* \u03c0 0)= M (D s* \u03c0 0)\u2212 M (D s*), both of them at values near 350 MeV\/c 2. We interpret these peaks as signatures of two distinct states, the D sJ*(2317)+ plus a new state, designated as the D sJ (2463)+. Because of the similar \u0394 M values, each of these states represents a source of background for the other if photons are lost, ignored or added. A quantitative accounting of \u2026",

            "We report on a study of the process e+ e\u2212\u2192 \u03c0\u00b1(D D*)\u2213 at s= 4.26 GeV using a 525 pb\u2212 1 data sample collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. A distinct charged structure is observed in the (D D*)\u2213 invariant mass distribution. When fitted to a mass-dependent-width Breit-Wigner line shape, the pole mass and width are determined to be M pole=(3883. 9\u00b11.5 (stat)\u00b14.2 (syst)) MeV\/c 2 and \u0393 pole=(24. 8\u00b13.3 (stat)\u00b111. 0 (syst)) MeV. The mass and width of the structure, which we refer to as Z c (3885), are 2 \u03c3 and 1 \u03c3, respectively, below those of the Z c (3900)\u2192 \u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8 peak observed by BESIII and Belle in \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 final states produced at the same center-of-mass energy. The angular distribution of the \u03c0 Z c (3885) system favors a J P= 1+ quantum number assignment for the structure and disfavors 1\u2212 or 0\u2212. The Born cross section times the D D* branching fraction of the Z c (3885) is measured to be \u2026",
