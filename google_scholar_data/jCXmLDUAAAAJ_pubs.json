            "Instrument fracture within the root canal during root canal treatment is an unwanted and frustrating complication. The fractured segment may hinder cleaning and shaping procedures with potential impact on prognosis of treatment. Fracture of endodontic instrument often results from incorrect use or overuse. If breakage occurs clinically, the patient should be informed of the incident and consideration should be given whether to remove the fragment or not. When managed properly, the presence of a broken fragment per se may not adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment. This article reports management of an intracanal separated instrument. Masserann kit along with gates glidden drills were used to remove the intracanal broken instrument.",
