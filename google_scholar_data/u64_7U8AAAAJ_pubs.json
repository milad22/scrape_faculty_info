            "Despite being a complex many-body system, the atomic nucleus exhibits simple structures for certain \u2018magic\u2019numbers of protons and neutrons. The calcium chain in particular is both unique and puzzling: evidence of doubly magic features are known in 40, 48 Ca, and recently suggested in two radioactive isotopes, 52, 54 Ca. Although many properties of experimentally known calcium isotopes have been successfully described by nuclear theory, it is still a challenge to predict the evolution of their charge radii. Here we present the first measurements of the charge radii of 49, 51, 52 Ca, obtained from laser spectroscopy experiments at ISOLDE, CERN. The experimental results are complemented by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. The large and unexpected increase of the size of the neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond N= 28 challenges the doubly magic nature of 52 Ca and opens new intriguing questions \u2026",

Through a comparison of the measured charge radii with predictions from the spherical droplet model, it is concluded that the ground-state wave function remains spherical down to Fr 205, with a departure observed in Fr 203 (N= 116).",

The existence of a long-lived isomer with a few hundred milliseconds half-life is confirmed, and the nuclear spins and moments of the ground and isomeric states in Zn 79 as well as the isomer shift are measured. From the observed hyperfine structures, spins I= 9\/2 and I= 1\/2 are firmly assigned to the ground and isomeric states. The magnetic moment \u03bc (Zn 79)=\u2212 1.1866 (10) \u03bc N, confirms the spin-parity 9\/2+ with a \u03bd g 9\/2\u2212 1 shell-model configuration, in excellent agreement with the prediction from large scale shell-model theories. The magnetic moment \u03bc (Zn 79 m)=\u2212 1.0180 (12) \u03bc N supports a positive parity for the isomer, with a wave function dominated by a 2 h\u2212 1 p neutron excitation across the N= 50 shell gap.

The high resolution innate to collinear laser spectroscopy is combined with the high efficiency of ion detection to provide a highly sensitive technique to probe the hyperfine structure of exotic isotopes. The technique of decay-assisted laser spectroscopy is presented, whereby the isomeric ion beam is deflected to a decay-spectroscopy station for alpha-decay tagging of the hyperfine components. Here, we present the first hyperfine-structure measurements of the neutron-deficient francium isotopes Fr 202\u2013206, in addition to the identification of the low-lying states of Fr 202, 204 performed at the CRIS experiment.",
