Amine-modified silica aerogels were prepared by copolymerizing small amounts of (aminopropyl)triethoxysilane with tetraethoxysilane. After silation of the aminated gels with hexamethyldisilazane, they were dried as aerogels using supercritical carbon dioxide processing. The resulting aerogels had only the amine groups as initiators for the cyanoacrylate polymerizations, resulting in cyanoacrylate macromolecules that were higher in molecular weight than those observed with unmodified silica and that were covalently attached to the silica surface. Starting with aminated silica aerogels that were 0.075 g\/cm3 density, composite aerogels were made with densities up to 0.220 g\/cm3 and up to 31 times stronger (flexural strength) than the precursor aerogel and about 2.3 \u2026",

In this work, we designed charged \u223c5 nm Au nanospheres coated with binary mixed-charge ligand monolayers that do not change in size upon incubation in pure fetal bovine serum (FBS). This lack of protein adsorption was unexpected in view of the fact that the Au surface was moderately charged. The mixed-charge monolayers were composed of anionic citrate ligands modified by place exchange with naturally occurring amino acids: either cationic lysine or zwitterionic cysteine ligands. The zwitterionic tips of either the lysine or cysteine ligands interact weakly with the proteins and furthermore increase the distance between the \u201cburied\u201d charges closer to the Au surface and the interacting sites on the protein surface.

            "Although sub-100 nm nanoclusters of metal nanoparticles are of interest in many fields including biomedical imaging, sensors, and catalysis, it has been challenging to control their morphologies and chemical properties. Herein, a new concept is presented to assemble equilibrium Au nanoclusters of controlled size by tuning the colloidal interactions with a polymeric stabilizer, PLA(1k)-b-PEG(10k)-b-PLA(1k). The nanoclusters form upon mixing a dispersion of \u223c5 nm Au nanospheres with a polymer solution followed by partial solvent evaporation. A weakly adsorbed polymer quenches the equilibrium nanocluster size and provides steric stabilization. Nanocluster size is tuned from \u223c20 to \u223c40 nm by experimentally varying the final Au nanoparticle concentration and the polymer\/Au ratio, along with the charge on the initial Au nanoparticle surface.

These assemblies were formed between 1 s to 30 min by tuning the electrostatic repulsion and the interparticle bridging attraction between the cations and citrate ligands as a function of electrolyte concentration. For dilute Ca2+, strong interparticle bridging favored particle attachment at chain ends. This resulted in the formation of small, branched chains with lengths as short as 20 nm, due to the large Debye length for the diffuse counterions. Furthermore, the bridging produced very small interparticle spacings and sintering, as evident in high-resolution TEM despite the low temperature. This morphology produced a large red shift in the surface plasmon resonance, as characterized by a broad extinction peak with NIR absorption out to 1000 nm, which is unusual for \u2026",
