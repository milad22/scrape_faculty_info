            "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",

The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 880 nb\u2212 1, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Photon candidates are identified by combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate. The results are compared to predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.",

            "Modern general-purpose detectors at high-energy colliders are based on the concept of cylindrical detection layers, nested around the beam axis. Starting from the beam interaction region, particles first enter a tracker, in which charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and origins (vertices) are reconstructed from signals (hits) in the sensitive layers. The tracker is immersed in a magnetic field that bends the trajectories and allows the electric charges and momenta of charged particles to be measured. Electrons and photons are then absorbed in an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The corresponding electromagnetic showers are detected as clusters of energy recorded in neighbouring cells, from which the energy and direction of the particles can be determined. Charged and neutral hadrons may initiate a hadronic shower in the ECAL as well, which is subsequently fully absorbed in the hadron calorimeter (HCAL \u2026",

The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region (| \u03b7|< 0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2< p t< 5.0 GeV\/c. The elliptic flow signal v 2, measured using the 4-particle correlation method, averaged over transverse momentum and pseudorapidity is 0.087\u00b10.002 (stat)\u00b10.003 (syst) in the 40%\u201350% centrality class. The differential elliptic flow v 2 (p t) reaches a maximum of 0.2 near p t= 3 GeV\/c. Compared to RHIC Au-Au collisions at s N N= 200 GeV, the elliptic flow increases by about 30%. Some hydrodynamic model predictions which include viscous corrections are in agreement with the observed increase.",

The spectra are presented over the transverse momentum ranges spanning 0. 5< p T< 400 GeV in pp and 0. 7< p T< 400 GeV in PbPb collisions. The corresponding nuclear modification factor, R AA, is measured in bins of collision centrality. The R AA in the 5% most central collisions shows a maximal suppression by a factor of 7-8 in the p T region of 6-9 GeV. This dip is followed by an increase, which continues up to the highest p T measured, and approaches unity in the vicinity of p T= 200 GeV. The R AA is compared to theoretical predictions and earlier experimental results at lower collision energies.
