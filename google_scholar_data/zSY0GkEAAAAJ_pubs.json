            "We propose a new state of matter in which the pairing interactions carve out a gap within the interior of a large Fermi ball, while the exterior surface remains gapless. This defines a system which contains both a superfluid and a normal Fermi liquid simultaneously, with both gapped and gapless quasiparticle excitations. The universality class of this state can be realized at weak coupling. We predict that a cold mixture of two species of fermionic atoms with different mass will exhibit this state. For electrons in appropriate solids, it would define a material that is simultaneously superconducting and metallic.",

The recent implementation of orbital degrees of freedom in chequerboard 1, 2 and hexagonal 3 optical lattices opens up a new avenue towards discovering novel quantum states of matter that have no prior analogues in solid-state electronic materials. Here, we predict that an exotic topological semimetal emerges as a parity-protected gapless state in the orbital bands of a two-dimensional fermionic optical lattice. This new quantum state is characterized by a parabolic band-degeneracy point with Berry flux 2\u03c0, in sharp contrast to the \u03c0 flux of Dirac points as in graphene. We show that the appearance of this topological liquid is universal for all lattices with D 4 point-group symmetry, as long as orbitals with opposite parities hybridize strongly with each other and the band degeneracy is protected by odd parity.

Here we propose a new quantum state where bosonic alkali-metal atoms condense at nonzero momenta, defying the paradigm. This becomes possible when the atoms are confined in the p-orbital Bloch band of an optical lattice rather than the usual s-orbital band. The new condensate simultaneously forms an order of transversely staggered orbital currents, reminiscent of orbital antiferromagnetism or d-density wave in correlated electronic systems but different in fundamental ways. We discuss several approaches of preparing atoms to the p-orbital band and propose an \u201cenergy blocking\u201d mechanism by Feshbach resonance to protect them from decaying to the lowest s-orbital band. Such a model system seems very unique and novel to atomic gases. It suggests a new \u2026",
