            "The optimal time for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy for asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is uncertain.We conducted two parallel analyses involving a total of 17,517 asymptomatic patients with HIV infection in the United States and Canada who received medical care during the period from 1996 through 2005. None of the patients had undergone previous antiretroviral therapy. In each group, we stratified the patients according to the CD4+ count (351 to 500 cells per cubic millimeter or >500 cells per cubic millimeter) at the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. In each group, we compared the relative risk of death for patients who initiated therapy when the CD4+ count was above each of the two thresholds of interest (early-therapy group) with that of patients who deferred therapy until the CD4+ count fell below these thresholds (deferred-therapy group \u2026",

In this paper, the authors outline 3 regression approaches for estimating 2 key quantities in competing risks analysis: the cause-specific relative hazard (csRH) and the subdistribution relative hazard (sdRH). They compare and contrast the structure of the risk sets and the interpretation of parameters obtained with these methods. They also demonstrate the use of these methods with data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study established in 1993, treating time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy or to clinical disease progression as competing events. In our example, women with an injection drug use history were less likely than those without a history of injection drug use to initiate therapy prior to progression to acquired \u2026",

            "CONTEXT: HIV-1 RNA and lymphocyte subset levels are the principal indications for antiretroviral treatment. Past reports have differed with regard to the effect of gender and race on these measures and in measures of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To assess racial and gender differences in HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ lymphocyte decline. DESIGN: A longitudinal study based in the two largest HIV natural history cohort studies conducted in 7 metropolitan areas of the United States. RESULTS: In all, 1256 adult women and 1603 adult men for whom multiple data points were available prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy were included. Women were more likely to be nonwhite, to have a history of injection drug use, and to have HIV-associated symptoms. After adjustment for differences in measurement method, baseline CD4+ cell count, age, and clinical symptoms, HIV-1 RNA levels were 32% to 50% lower in women than in men at CD4+ counts> 200 cells\/mm3 (p<. 001) but not at CD4+ cell counts< 200 cells\/mm3. HIV-1 RNA levels were also 41% lower in nonwhites than in whites (p<. 001) and 21% lower in persons reporting a prior history of injection drug use (p<. 001). Women had more rapid declines in CD4+ cell counts over time than men (difference in slope of 46 cells\/year) and nonwhite individuals had slower decline in CD4 cell counts than whites (difference of 39 cells\/year). CONCLUSIONS: Both race and gender influence the values of HIV-1 RNA and the rate of HIV-1 disease progression as indicated by decline in CD4 cell counts over time. These effects could provide clues regarding the factors that influence HIV-disease \u2026",
