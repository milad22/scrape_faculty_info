            "Four constructed, experimental wetlands at the Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Project near Chicago, Illinois, USA, were studied during the 1990 and 1991 growing seasons, to evaluate certain water quality functions. The wetlands, ranging in size from 2 to 3.5 hectares with a maximum depth around 1.5 m, were supplied with water from the nearby Des Plaines River. Concentrations of total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids, nitrate-nitrogen, and total phosphorus, measured at the inlet and outlet of each wetland, were consistently lower at the outlets. Based on constituent mass balances for each wetland, trap efficiencies (percent removal) ranged from 76 to 99% for total suspended solids, from 39 to 99% for nitrate-nitrogen, and from 52 to 99% for total phosphorus. Although the wetlands were subjected to different hydraulic loading rates, their effluent water quality was similar. Also, although \u2026",

Following a successful greenhouse experiment, a panel study under field weather elucidated the efficiency of the chelating agent ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) on phytoextraction of lead (Pb) by vetiver grass, a hyperaccumulator of Pb, and a nonaccumulator fescue grass from residential soils contaminated with Pb-based paint from Baltimore, MD and San Antonio, TX. Three soils from each city with Pb content between 1000 and 2400 mg kg\u22121 were chosen for the panel study. Sequential extraction revealed that Fe-Mn oxide (60\u201363%) and carbonate (25\u201333%) fractions of Pb dominated in Baltimore soils, whereas in San Antonio soils, Pb was primarily bound to the organic fraction (64\u201370%) because organic content was greater and \u2026",

It can be defined as the design, construction, operation, and management of landscape\/aquatic structures and associated plant and animal communities to benefit humanity and nature. It is introduced by comparing it with \u201cconventional\u201d engineering, including case studies with cost and performance data. Ecological engineering can offer important potential advantages: better performance, less cost, multiple benefits, and better acceptance by the public and regulators. It can cost less because structures are sometimes not as highly engineered and are durable and self-maintaining. Natural energy sources and self-regulating processes reduce operation and maintenance costs. The ancillary benefits can be ecological, recreational, or economic.
