            "The structure of the earth has been extensively studied using seismic waves generated by natural earthquakes and man-made sources. In classical seismology, the earth is considered to consist of a sequence of horizontal layers having differing elastic properties, which are determined from travel-time readings of body waves and the dispersion of surface waves. More recently, three-dimensional inhomogeneity having scale larger than the predominant seismic wavelength has been characterized using travel-time data with velocity tomography. Forward and inverse waveform modeling methods for deterministic models have been developed that can model complicated structures allowing many features of complex waveforms to be successfully explained. Classical seismic methods are described in books like Quantitative Seismology: Theory and Methods by Aki and Richards [1980], Seismic Waves and Sources by \u2026",
