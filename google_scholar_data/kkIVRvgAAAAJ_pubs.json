            "It is believed that depending on the thermodynamic stability of the 5\u2032-strand and the 3\u2032-strand in the stem-loop structure of a precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA), cells preferentially select the less stable one (called the miRNA or guide strand) and destroy the other one (called the miRNA* or passenger strand). However, our expression profiling analyses revealed that both strands could be co-accumulated as miRNA pairs in some tissues while being subjected to strand selection in other tissues. Our target prediction and validation assays demonstrated that both strands of a miRNA pair could target equal numbers of genes and that both were able to suppress the expression of their target genes. Our finding not only suggests that the numbers of miRNAs and their targets are much greater than what we previously thought, but also implies that novel mechanisms are involved in the tissue-dependent miRNA \u2026",

Many previous studies have attempted to characterize the conductances responsible for pacemaker current and slow waves in the GI tract, but the precise mechanism of electrical rhythmicity is still debated. We used a new transgenic mouse with a bright green fluorescent protein (copGFP) constitutively expressed in ICC to facilitate study of these cells in mixed cell dispersions. We found that ICC express a specialized \u2018slow wave\u2019 current. Reversal of tail current analysis showed this current was due to a Cl\u2212 selective conductance.

The search for epigenetic factors in mammalian sperm that transmit acquired phenotypes has recently focused on RNAs and, more recently, RNA modifications. Here, we review insights that have been gained from studying sperm RNAs and RNA modifications, and their roles in influencing offspring phenotypes. We discuss the possible mechanisms by which sperm become acquisitive following environmental\u2013somatic\u2013germline interactions, and how they transmit paternally acquired phenotypes by shaping early embryonic development.",

To explore the potential pro-survival function of SCF during spermatogenesis, the seminiferous tubules from stage XII were cultured in the presence or absence of SCF (100 ng\/ml) for 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively, and apoptosis was analyzed by DNA laddering and in situ 3\u2032-end labeling (ISEL) staining.

It has long been  thought that H1t is the only testis-specific linker histone, and that all  linker histones are replaced by transition proteins, and subsequently by  protamines during spermiogenesis.

Rat ARIP3 is a nuclear protein comprising 572 amino acids. It modulates AR-dependent but not basal transcription, suggesting that ARIP3 acts as an AR transcriptional coregulator. Except for the C-terminal AR-interacting domain, ARIP3 contains distinct regions that are also present in two recently described proteins, a protein inhibitor of activated Stat3 and an RNA helicase II-interacting protein (Gu\/RH-II binding protein). Conserved structural features of these proteins indicate the existence of a gene family involved in the regulation of various transcription factors.

            "Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis is characterized by transcriptional silencing of genes on both the X and Y chromosomes in mid-to-late pachytene spermatocytes 1. MSCI is believed to result from meiotic silencing of unpaired DNA because the X and Y chromosomes remain largely unpaired throughout first meiotic prophase 2. However, unlike X-chromosome inactivation in female embryonic cells, where 25\u201330% of X-linked structural genes have been reported to escape inactivation 3, previous microarray 4-and RT-PCR 5\u2013based studies of expression of> 364 X-linked mRNA-encoding genes during spermatogenesis have failed to reveal any X-linked gene that escapes the silencing effects of MSCI in primary spermatocytes. Here we show that many X-linked miRNAs are transcribed and processed in pachytene spermatocytes. This unprecedented escape from MSCI by these X \u2026",
