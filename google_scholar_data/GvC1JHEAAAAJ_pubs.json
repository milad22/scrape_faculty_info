            "On September 14, 2015 at 09: 50: 45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 \u03c3. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0\u2212 180+ 160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z= 0.0 9\u2212 0.04+ 0.03. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6\u2212 4+ 5 M\u2299 and 2 9\u2212 4+ 4 M\u2299, and the final black hole mass is 6 2\u2212 4+ 4 M\u2299, with 3. 0\u2212 0.5+ 0.5 M\u2299 c 2 \u2026",

            "On August 17, 2017 at 12\u2236 41: 04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0\u00d7 10 4 years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M\u2299, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17\u20131.60 M\u2299, with the total mass of the system 2.7 4\u2212 0.01+ 0.04 M\u2299. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg 2 (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of 4 0\u2212 14+ 8 Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet.

The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 \u03c3. The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of 3. 4\u2212 0.9+ 0.7\u00d7 10\u2212 22.

The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry\u2013Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic \u2026",
