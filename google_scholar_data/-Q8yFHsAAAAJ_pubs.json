            "We present a study of the dynamics of optical contrast agents indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) in an adenocarcinoma rat tumor model. Measurements are conducted with a combined frequency-domain and steady-state optical technique that facilitates rapid measurement of tissue absorption in the 650\u20131000-nm spectral region. Tumors were also imaged by use of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and coregistered with the location of the optical probe. The absolute concentrations of contrast agent, oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and water are measured simultaneously each second for approximately 10 min. The differing tissue uptake kinetics of ICG and MB in these late-stage tumors arise from differences in their effective molecular weights. ICG, because of its binding to plasma proteins, behaves as a macromolecular contrast agent with a low vascular permeability. A \u2026",

            "Structural changes in water molecules are related to physiological, anatomical and pathological properties of tissues. Near infrared (NIR) optical absorption methods are sensitive to water; however, detailed characterization of water in thick tissues is difficult to achieve because subtle spectral shifts can be obscured by multiple light scattering. In the NIR, a water absorption peak is observed around 975 nm. The precise NIR peak's shape and position are highly sensitive to water molecular disposition. We introduce a bound water index (BWI) that quantifies shifts observed in tissue water absorption spectra measured by broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS). DOS quantitatively measures light absorption and scattering spectra and therefore reveals bound water spectral shifts. BWI as a water state index was validated by comparing broadband DOS to magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted MRI \u2026",

The purpose of this system is to perform quantitative fluorescence tomography using multi-modality imaging approach. XCT anatomical information is used as structural priori while optical background heterogeneity information obtained by DOT measurements is used as functional priori. The performance of the hybrid system is evaluated using multi-modality phantoms. In particular, we show that a 2.4 mm diameter fluorescence inclusion located in a heterogeneous medium can be localized accurately with the functional a priori information, although the fluorophore concentration is recovered with 70% error. On the other hand, the fluorophore concentration can be accurately recovered within 8% error only when both DOT optical \u2026",

In this study, we investigate the performance of a frequency-domain FT system for small inclusions that are embedded in a heterogeneous background. The results demonstrate that functional and structural a priori information is crucial to be able to recover both parameters with high accuracy. The functional a priori information is defined by the absorption and scattering maps at both excitation and emission wavelengths. Similarly, the boundaries of the small inclusion and different regions in the background are utilized as the structural a priori information. Without a priori information, the fluorophore concentration of a 5 mm inclusion in a 40 mm medium is recovered with 50% error, while the lifetime cannot be recovered at all.

In this present work, the details of a combined MR-diffuse optical imaging system for dual-modality imaging of small animals are given. As a part of this effort, a multi-spectral frequency domain diffuse optical tomography system is integrated with an MRI system. Here, a network analyzer provides the rf modulation signal for the laser diodes and measures the amplitude and the phase of the detected signals. Photomultiplier tubes are utilized to measure low-level signals. The integration of this optical imaging system with the 4T MRI system is realized by incorporating a fiber adaptive interface inside the MR magnet. Coregistration is achieved by a special \u2026",
