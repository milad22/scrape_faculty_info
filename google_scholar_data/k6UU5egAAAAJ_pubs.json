Shu (1996) and X.-D. Liu, S. Osher, and T. Chan (1994). Used by themselves, the schemes may not always be monotonicity preserving but coupled with the monotonicity preserving bounds of A. Suresh and H. T. Huynh (1997) they perform very well. The resulting monotonicity preserving weighted essentially non-oscillatory (MPWENO) schemes have high phase accuracy and high order of accuracy. The higher-order members of this family are almost spectrally accurate for smooth problems. Nevertheless, they, have robust shock capturing ability. The schemes are stable under normal CFL numbers. They are also efficient and do not have a computational complexity that is substantially greater than that of the lower-order members of this same \u2026",

In that form it becomes possible to use higher order Godunov schemes for their solution. This results in a robust and accurate solution strategy. However, the magnetic field also satisfies a constraint that requires its divergence to be zero at all times. This is a property that cannot be guaranteed in the zone centered discretizations that are favored in Godunov schemes without involving a divergence cleaning step. In this paper we present a staggered mesh strategy which directly uses the properly upwinded fluxes that are provided by a Godunov scheme. The process of directly using the upwinded fluxes relies on a duality that exists between the fluxes obtained from a higher order Godunov scheme and the electric fields in a plasma. By exploiting this duality we have been able to construct a higher \u2026",

The stability analysis is done without any major restrictions and, hence, models the full Euler equations in one dimension. This then allows us to deduce optimal ranges for parameters that need to be used in SPH. Thus we show that for the commonly used M5 spline the ratio of smoothing length to interparticle distance should range between 1.0 to 1.4. We also show that the linear artificial viscosity coefficient and the coefficient of spatial filtering have to be bounded. The results of this von Neumann stability analysis provide us with several suggestions for future algorithm improvement. Because the SPH method is so unique we provide, wherever possible, comparisons with more familiar and well-used high resolution finite difference methods.",

The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M\u2a7e N, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes (N= 0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (N= M). In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator.
