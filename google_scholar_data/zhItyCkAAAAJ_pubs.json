A significant expansion of the decay scheme of In 131, including 17 new excited states and 35 new \u03b3-ray transitions in Sn 81 50 131 is also reported. This leads to large changes in the deduced \u03b2-branching ratios to some of the low-lying states of Sn 131 compared to previous work with implications for the strength of the first-forbidden \u03b2 transitions in the vicinity of doubly magic Sn 82 50 132.",

We present a detector concept aimed at measuring the diffuse flux of tau neutrinos in this energy range via a high-elevation mountaintop detector using the radio technique. The detector searches for radio signals from upgoing air showers generated by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Signals from several antennas in a compact array are coherently summed at the trigger level, permitting not only directional masking of anthropogenic backgrounds, but also a low trigger threshold. This design takes advantage of both the large viewing area available at high-elevation sites and the nearly full duty cycle available to radio instruments.
