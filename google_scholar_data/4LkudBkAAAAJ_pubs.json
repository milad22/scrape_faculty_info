Seawater from within a natural Macrocystis bed had elevated CH3X concentrations compared to seawater from outside the kelp bed. Highest concentrations were associated with regions of high biomass density: surface canopy and sporophyll\/juvenile frond zone. Rates of methyl halide production (normalized to kelp biomass) were determined from the short\u2010term incubation, blade culture, and natural population, the latter based on a simple hydrodynamic model. Estimates of global CH3X production based on these production rates and published estimates of global kelp standing stock suggest that kelps (and other marine macroalgae) are not a significant source of global CH \u2026",

Methyl iodide production by blade tissue from five kelp species was not enhanced by desiccation, but production rates were enhanced by drastic cellular disruption. Wounding and tissue age of Macrocystis pyrifera had no effect on methyl iodide production. Undefined microbial populations, obtained from decaying kelp, produced methyl iodide at low rates while growing on suspensions of powdered kelp tissue in seawater and on artificial media. This study (1984\u20131985 on kelp collected from California, USA) confirms that direct methyl iodide production by kelp is not globally significant, but suggests that production by marine microbes \u2026",

Algae and fungi produce bothmethyl halides and polyhalomethanes, whereasplants are known to produce only methylhalides. Why these organisms producehalomethanes is a question frequently asked bychemists and biologists. This question impliesthat halomethanes have a function and have aselective value to the producing organism.Except for some fungi, the evolutionaryadvantage of producing halomethanes may notpresently exist. Polyhalomethanes areby-products of halogenation of certain organiccompounds by haloperoxidases in marine algaeand perhaps some fungi, and they may beindirectly produced in aquatic environments byalgal release of oxidized halogen species.

            "Emissions of CH3Cl, CH3Br and CH3I were measured biweekly for 12\u2010 to 24\u2010month periods between March 2002 and March 2005 from monospecific stands of four dominant southern California coastal salt marsh plants. These measurements revealed large inherent differences between species and more detailed patterns of seasonal production than previously reported. Marsh plants displayed intrinsic abilities to produce methyl halides. Salt marsh plants produced 92% of CH3Cl and 90% of CH3Br emitted and only 41% of the emitted CH3I. Unvegetated areas emitted 7.9% of CH3Cl, 9.9% CH3Br, and 59% of the emitted CH3I. The accuracy of the estimated methyl halide emissions from a coastal marsh and probably other ecosystems can be dramatically improved with increasing the number of species being measured and including emission from barren (mudflats and soil) areas.

            "Physiological factors affecting bromoform (CHBr3) production by Ulva lactuca were investigated using metabolic inhibitors and presumed substrates of bromoperoxidase (BrPO). The metabolic inhibitors were used at a verified physiologically active concentration. Bromoform production was nearly tripled in the light (376 \u00b1 92 pg cm\u22122 h\u22121) compared to the dark (114 \u00b1 70 pg cm\u22122 h\u22121), was inhibited in the light in the presence of the photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU, and was inhibited in the dark in the presence of mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor rotenone. Removal of H2O2 from seawater (treatment with catalase) decreased CHBr3 production in the light and dark. Addition of H2O2 to incubations at either 1.0 mM or 100 \u00b5M significantly decreased CHBr3 production in the light and inhibited photosynthesis. In the dark, CHBr3 production was decreased and respiration inhibited in the presence of 1 mM H2O2; CHBr3 \u2026",

Production was greater from water collected near shore than 16 km offshore, presumably reflecting the difference in the reactive dissolved organic matter (DOMreact) concentrations. In the spring, there was an increase in phytoplankton abundance, and CHBr3 production from BrPO incubations was greater, presumably due to increased DOMreact. In the winter, CH2Br2 production was enhanced, although still lower than CHBr3, suggesting a qualitative change in DOM composition due to terrestrial runoff. During the month of the highest precipitation, CHBr3 and CH2Br2 production was enhanced in samples obtained \u2026",
