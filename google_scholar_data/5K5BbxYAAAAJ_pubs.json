The dominant uncertainties were attributed to the absolute determination of the fluence of the neutron beam (2.7 s). The fluence was measured with a neutron monitor that counted the neutron-induced charged particles from absorption in a thin, well-characterized Li 6 deposit. The detection efficiency of the monitor was calculated from the areal density of the deposit, the detector solid angle, and the evaluated nuclear data file, ENDF\/B-VI Li 6 (n, t) He 4 thermal neutron cross section. In the current work, we measure the detection efficiency of the same monitor used in the neutron lifetime measurement with a second, totally absorbing neutron detector. This direct approach does not rely on the Li 6 (n, t) He 4 cross section or any other nuclear data. The detection \u2026",

            "The decay of the free neutron into a proton, electron, and antineutrino is the prototype semileptonic weak decay and is the simplest example of nuclear beta decay. It played a key role in the early Universe as it determined the ratio of neutrons to protons during the era of primordial light element nucleosynthesis. Neutron decay is physically related to important processes in solar physics and neutrino detection. The mean neutron lifetime has been the subject of more than 20 major experiments done, using a variety of methods, between 1950 and the present. The most precise recent measurements have stated accuracies approaching 0.1%, but are not in good agreement as they differ by as much as 5 \u03c3 using quoted uncertainties. The history of neutron lifetime measurements is reviewed and the different methods used are described, giving important examples of each. The discrepancies and some systematic issues in \u2026",

            "Accurate measurement of the lifetime of the neutron (which is unstable to beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force 1 and the creation of matter during the Big Bang 2. Previous measurements of the neutron lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors 3; however, these could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in a magnetic trap. Neutral-particle and charged-particle traps are widely used for studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long interaction times and isolation of particles from perturbing environments 4. Here we report the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with superfluid 4 He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons in the trap have a lifetime of 750+ 330-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap \u2026",

            "We present the results of two separate measurements of the half-life of 44 Ti relative to those of 22 Na and 207 Bi, respectively. By comparing the numbers of 1157-keV \u03b3 rays from 44 Ti to those of 1274-keV \u03b3 rays from 22 Na observed from a mixed source over a period of approximately 2 yr, we determined the half-life of 44 Ti to be 61.5\u00b11.0 yr. From an approximately 1-yr-long study of another mixed source, where we compared the numbers of 1157-keV \u03b3 rays from 44 Ti to those of 1064-keV \u03b3 rays from 207 Bi, we determined the 44 Ti half-life to be 62\u00b15 yr. From these two results, we have obtained a best value of 62\u00b12 yr for the half-life of 44 Ti. The astrophysical implications of this result are discussed.",
