Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly 1, 2. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars 3, 4, 5, and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts< z> of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40% and 24% of its current age.

Although the current high-z samples are still small and biased towards the luminous and massive tail of the actively star-forming \u2018main-sequence\u2019, a fairly clear picture is emerging. Independent of whether galaxy-integrated quantities or surface densities are considered, low- and high-z SFG populations appear to follow similar molecular gas\u2013star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2, over three orders of magnitude in gas mass or surface density. The gas-depletion time-scale in these SFGs grows from 0.5 Gyr at z\u223c 2 to 1.5 Gyr at z\u223c 0.
