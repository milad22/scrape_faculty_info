Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a \u201csteady-state\u201d population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age.

Cell-size homeostasis has been discussed in the context of two major paradigms: \u201csizer,\u201d in which the cell actively monitors its size and triggers the cell cycle once it reaches a critical size, and \u201ctimer,\u201d in which the cell attempts to grow for a specific amount of time before division. These paradigms, in conjunction with the \u201cgrowth law\u201d [1] and the quantitative bacterial cell-cycle model [2], inspired numerous theoretical models [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and experimental investigations, from growth [10, 11] to cell cycle and size control [12, 13, 14, 15]. However, experimental evidence involved difficult-to-verify assumptions or population-averaged data, which allowed different interpretations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] or limited conclusions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Here we address a basic physical issue associated with bacterial chromosome segregation, namely the spatial organization of highly confined, self-avoiding polymers (of nontrivial topology) in a rod-shaped cell-like geometry. Through computer simulations, we present evidence that, under strong confinement conditions, topologically distinct domains of a polymer complex effectively repel each other to maximize their conformational entropy, suggesting that duplicated circular chromosomes could partition spontaneously. This mechanism not only is able to account for the spatial separation per se but also captures the major features of the spatiotemporal organization of the duplicating chromosomes observed in Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus.",

We posit that replicated Escherichia coli daughter strands will spontaneously demix as a result of entropic forces, despite their strong confinement within the cell; in other words, we propose that entropy can act as a primordial physical force which drives chromosome segregation under the right physical conditions. Furthermore, proteins implicated in the regulation of chromosome structure and segregation may in fact function primarily in supporting such an entropy-driven segregation mechanism by regulating the physical state of chromosomes. We conclude that bacterial chromosome segregation is best understood in terms of spontaneous demixing of daughter strands.

Although many proteins involved in this process have been identified, the nature of the global forces that shape and segregate the chromosomes has remained unclear because of limited knowledge of the micromechanical properties of the chromosome. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally the fundamentally soft nature of the bacterial chromosome and the entropic forces that can compact it in a crowded intracellular environment. We developed a unique \u201cmicropiston\u201d and measured the force-compression behavior of single Escherichia coli chromosomes in confinement. Our data show that forces on the order of 100 pN and free energies on the order of 105 kBT are sufficient to compress the chromosome to its in vivo size.

Atomic force microscopy confirms that EAK16-I and -II form fibrillar assemblies, whereas EAK16-IV forms globular structures. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of EAK16-IV indicates the possible formation of a \u03b2-turn structure, which is not found in EAK16-I and -II. Our theoretical \u2026",

However, it has not been understood how cell size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can result in the same cell size.
