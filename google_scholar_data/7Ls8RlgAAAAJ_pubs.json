For our tests we make use of three-dimensional 512 3 compressible MHD isothermal simulations performed for different sonic, ie, , where V L is the injection velocity, V s is the sound velocity, and Alfv\u00e9nic , where V A is the Alfv\u00e9n velocity, Mach numbers. We introduce the bispectrum, a new tool for statistical studies of the interstellar medium which, unlike an ordinary power spectrum of turbulence, preserves the phase information of the stochastic field. We show that the bispectra of the three-dimensional stochastic density field and of column densities, available from observations, are similar. This opens good prospects for studies of MCs and diffuse media with the new tool. We use the bispectrum technique to define the role of nonlinear wave-wave \u2026",

Turbulence in the interstellar medium produces a global cascade of random gas motions, spanning scales ranging from 100 parsecs to 1,000 kilometres (ref. 4). Fundamental parameters of interstellar turbulence such as the sonic Mach number (the speed of sound) have been difficult to determine, because observations have lacked the sensitivity and resolution to image the small-scale structure associated with turbulent motion 5, 6, 7. Observations of linear polarization and Faraday rotation in radio emission from the Milky Way have identified unusual polarized structures that often have no counterparts in the total radiation intensity or at other wavelengths 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and whose physical significance has been unclear 13, 14, 15.

However, edges of the SMC\" bar\" have  and may be tracing shearing or turbulent flows. Using numerical simulations we also investigate how the slope of the spatial power spectrum depends on both sonic and Alfv\u00e9n Mach numbers.

The two dominant models are that the turbulence is driven by star formation feedback and\/or that it is produced by gravitational instability in the gas. Here we show that, while both models predict that the galaxies\u2019 ISM velocity dispersions will be positively correlated with their star formation rates, the forms of the correlation predicted by these two models are subtly but measurably different. A feedback-driven origin for the turbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star formation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. $\\skew4\\dot{M}_{\\ast } \\propto \\sigma ^2$), while a gravity-driven model yields a shallower rise and a strong dependence on gas fraction (i.e. $\\skew4\\dot{M}_{\\ast } \\propto f_{\\rm g}^2 \\sigma$).

Star formation feedback injects energy and momentum, and non-axisymmetric torques prevent the gas from becoming more than marginally gravitationally unstable. From these assumptions we derive the relationship between galaxies\u2019 bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and rotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and rates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered primarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the two. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation feedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide range of observations, including the star formation law measured in both spatially resolved and \u2026",
