Results obtained from simulations in which atoms hop from one fcc hollow site to another are compared with those obtained from a parallel set of simulations in which the database is supplemented by processes revealed in complementary molecular dynamics simulations at 500 K. They include processes involving the hcp (stacking-fault) sites, which facilitate concerted motion of the islands (simultaneous motion of all atoms in the island). A significant difference in the scaling of the effective diffusion barriers with island size is observed in the two cases. In particular, the presence of \u2026",

As the first steps in reforming our introductory courses and TA training program, we collected multiple types of data on TAs teaching in traditional algebra-based physics laboratories. Drawing on prior work on TAs' pedagogical knowledge, we explore how the beliefs expressed by TAs in interviews align with their practices during a laboratory video-taped mid-semester.

In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, linewidths are obtained from appropriate correlation functions and include the fully anharmonic contribution of the interaction potential. Surface relaxations and phonon frequencies calculated in the harmonic approximation, using selected many-body interatomic potentials, are found to be in good agreement with results from experimental data and ab initio calculations.
