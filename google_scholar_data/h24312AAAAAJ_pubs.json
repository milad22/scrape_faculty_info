            "A Bose-Einstein condensate was produced in a vapor of rubidium-87 atoms that was confined by magnetic fields and evaporatively cooled. The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.",

We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this discussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of: How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? Did you know it was going to work? How long did it take you and why? We will review some our favorites from among the experiments we have carried out with BEC. There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what \u2026",

            "We describe the first experiments that study in a controlled way the dynamics of distinguishable and interpenetrating bosonic quantum fluids. We work with a two-component system of Bose-Einstein condensates in the| F= 1, m f=\u2212 1> and| 2, 1> spin states of 87 Rb. The two condensates are created with complete spatial overlap, and in subsequent evolution they undergo complex relative motions that tend to preserve the total density profile. The motions quickly damp out, leaving the condensates in a steady state with a non-negligible (and adjustable) overlap region.",

In this experiment, 1.8\u00d7 10 7 neutral cesium atoms were optically captured directly from a low-pressure vapor in a small glass cell. We then cooled the< 1-mm 3 cloud of trapped atoms and loaded it into a low-field magnetic trap in the same cell. The magnetically trapped atoms had an effective temperature as low as 1.1\u00b10.2 \u03bcK, which is the lowest kinetic temperature ever observed and far colder than any previous sample of trapped atoms.",
