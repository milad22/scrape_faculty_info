In this paper, we present non-local operations as a generic family of building blocks for capturing long-range dependencies. Inspired by the classical non-local means method in computer vision, our non-local operation computes the response at a position as a weighted sum of the features at all positions. This building block can be plugged into many computer vision architectures. On the task of video classification, even without any bells and whistles, our non-local models can compete or outperform current competition winners on both Kinetics and Charades datasets. In static image recognition, our non-local models improve object detection\/segmentation and pose estimation on the COCO suite of tasks. Code will be made available.",

Most of the analyses use 20 of collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of TeV, although in some case an additional\\(4.7\\{\\mathrm {fb}^{-1}}\\) of collision data at TeV are used. New analyses are introduced to improve the sensitivity to specific regions of the model parameter space. Since no evidence of third-generation squarks is found, exclusion limits are derived by combining several analyses and are presented in both a simplified model framework, assuming simple decay chains, as well as within the context of more elaborate phenomenological supersymmetric models.",

Spirometry was performed on all eligible participants. Patients with airflow limitation (FEV1\/FVC < 0.70) were further examined by post-bronchodilator spirometry, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram.

We also observe that the algorithms used to first compute the reduct-soft-set and then to compute the choice value to select the optimal objects for the decision problems in [1] are not reasonable and we illustrate this with an example. Finally, we propose a reasonable definition of parameterization reduction of soft sets and compare it with the concept of attributes reduction in rough sets theory.

            "The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed-matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity 1, 2. However, many properties of exotic, strongly correlated spin systems, such as spin liquids, have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N\u2248 30 particles 3. Feynman predicted that a quantum simulator\u2014a special-purpose \u2018analogue\u2019processor built using quantum bits (qubits)\u2014would be inherently suited to solving such problems 4, 5. In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, but simulations allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on two-or three-dimensional lattices of more than a few tens of qubits have yet to be \u2026",

            "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose underground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy (MH) as a primary physics goal. The excellent energy resolution and the large fiducial volume anticipated for the JUNO detector offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important topics in neutrino and astro-particle physics. In this document, we present the physics motivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various proposed measurements. Following an introduction summarizing the current status and open issues in neutrino physics, we discuss how the detection of antineutrinos generated by a cluster of nuclear power plants allows the determination of the neutrino MH at a 3\u20134\u03c3 significance with six years of running of JUNO. The measurement of antineutrino spectrum with excellent energy resolution will also lead to \u2026",
