            "In the electrospinning process, polymer fibers with submicron-scale diameters are formed by subjecting a fluid jet to a high electric field. We report an experimental investigation of the electrically forced jet and its instabilities. The results are interpreted within the framework of a recently developed theory for electrified fluid jets. We find that the process can be described by a small set of operating parameters and summarized through the use of operating diagrams of electric field versus flow rate. In addition, the jet current is related to the net charge density and found to depend on the fluid properties, the applied electric field and the equipment configuration. The net charge density appears to be relatively insensitive to the flow rate, at least for high flow rates. The experiments reveal that a key process in the formation of submicron-scale solid fibers is a convective instability, the rapidly whipping jet. The dependence of \u2026",

            "Electrospinning is a process in which solid fibers are produced from a polymeric fluid stream (solution or melt) delivered through a millimeter-scale nozzle. The solid fibers are notable for their very small diameters (<1 \u03bcm). Recent experiments demonstrate that an essential mechanism of electrospinning is a rapidly whipping fluid jet. This series of papers analyzes the mechanics of this whipping jet by studying the instability of an electrically forced fluid jet with increasing field strength. An asymptotic approximation of the equations of electrohydrodynamics is developed so that quantitative comparisons with experiments can be carried out. The approximation governs both long wavelength axisymmetric distortions of the jet, as well as long wavelength oscillations of the centerline of the jet. Three different instabilities are identified: the classical (axisymmetric) Rayleigh instability, and electric field induced axisymmetric and \u2026",

            "Single-bubble sonoluminescence occurs when an acoustically trapped and periodically driven gas bubble collapses so strongly that the energy focusing at collapse leads to light emission. Detailed experiments have demonstrated the unique properties of this system: the spectrum of the emitted light tends to peak in the ultraviolet and depends strongly on the type of gas dissolved in the liquid; small amounts of trace noble gases or other impurities can dramatically change the amount of light emission, which is also affected by small changes in other operating parameters (mainly forcing pressure, dissolved gas concentration, and liquid temperature). This article reviews experimental and theoretical efforts to understand this phenomenon. The currently available information favors a description of sonoluminescence caused by adiabatic heating of the bubble at collapse, leading to partial ionization of the gas inside the \u2026",

            "Nanometre-and micrometre-sized charged particles at aqueous interfaces are typically stabilized by a repulsive Coulomb interaction. If one of the phases forming the interface is a nonpolar substance (such as air or oil) that cannot sustain a charge, the particles will exhibit long-ranged dipolar repulsion 1; if the interface area is confined, mutual repulsion between the particles can induce ordering 2 and even crystallization 3, 4. However, particle ordering has also been observed in the absence of area confinement 5, suggesting that like-charged particles at interfaces can also experience attractive interactions 6. Interface deformations are known to cause capillary forces that attract neighbouring particles to each other, but a satisfying explanation for the origin of such distortions remains outstanding 7, 8. Here we present quantitative measurements of attractive interactions between colloidal particles at an oil\u2013water \u2026",

            "Sound driven gas bubbles in water can emit light pulses. This phenomenon is called sonoluminescence (SL). Two different phases of single bubble SL have been proposed: diffusively stable and diffusively unstable SL. We present phase diagrams in the gas concentration versus forcing pressure state space and also in the ambient radius versus gas concentration and versus forcing pressure state spaces. These phase diagrams are based on the thresholds for energy focusing in the bubble and two kinds of instabilities, namely (i) shape instabilities and (ii) diffusive instabilities. Stable SL only occurs in a tiny parameter window of large forcing pressure amplitude Pa\u223c1.2\u20131.5 atm and low gas concentration of less than 0.4% of the saturation. The upper concentration threshold becomes smaller with increased forcing. Our results quantitatively agree with experimental results of Putterman\u2019s UCLA group on argon, but \u2026",
