Uncontrolled studies suggest that rituximab is effective and may be safer than a cyclophosphamide-based regimen.We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial of rituximab (375 mg per square meter of body-surface area per week for 4 weeks) as compared with cyclophosphamide (2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for remission induction. Glucocorticoids were tapered off; the primary end point was remission of disease without the use of prednisone at 6 months.Nine centers enrolled 197 ANCA-positive patients with either Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis.

Commonly referred to as the ANCA-associated vasculitides, these diseases are challenging to diagnose and to treat. Distinguishing the ANCA-associated vasculitides from other forms of vasculitis or nonvasculitic processes (such as infection) can be particularly difficult.

Cluster analysis was used to derive patterns of arterial disease in TAK versus GCA and in patients categorised by age at disease onset. Using latent class analysis, computer derived classification models based upon patterns of arterial disease were compared with traditional classification.Arteriographic lesions were identified in 145 patients with TAK and 62 patients with GCA.

Complete remission (CR) was defined as disease activity score of 0 and successful completion of the prednisone taper.PR3-AAV patients treated with rituximab (RTX) achieved CR at 6\u2005months more frequently than did those randomised to cyclophosphamide (CYC)\/azathioprine (AZA) (65% vs 48%; p=0.04).
