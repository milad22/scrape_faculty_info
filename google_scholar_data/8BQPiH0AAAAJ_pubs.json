            "A critical requirement for diverse applications in quantum information science is the capability to disseminate quantum resources over complex quantum networks 1, 2. For example, the coherent distribution of entangled quantum states together with quantum memory (for storing the states) can enable scalable architectures for quantum computation 3, communication 4 and metrology 5. Here we report observations of entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distinct, spatially separated set-ups. Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 10 5 atoms at each site 6. After a programmable delay, we confirm entanglement by mapping the state of the atoms to optical fields and measuring mutual coherences and photon statistics for these fields. We thereby \u2026",

            "Quantum networks are composed of quantum nodes that interact coherently through quantum channels, and open a broad frontier of scientific opportunities 1. For example, a quantum network can serve as a \u2018web\u2019for connecting quantum processors for computation 2, 3 and communication 4, or as a \u2018simulator\u2019allowing investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels 5, 6. The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and efficiently transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network. Although such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite systems 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, entangled states have not been achieved for interconnects capable of \u2018mapping\u2019multipartite \u2026",

            "Access to genuine multipartite entanglement of quantum states enables advances in                     quantum information science and also contributes to the understanding of                     strongly correlated quantum systems. We report the detection and                     characterization of heralded entanglement in a multipartite quantum state                     composed of four spatially distinct optical modes that share one photon, a                     so-called W state. By randomizing the relative phase between                     bipartite components of the W state, we observed the                     transitions from four- to three- to two-mode entanglement with increasing phase                     noise. These observations are possible for our system because our entanglement                     verification protocol makes use of quantum uncertainty relations to detect the                     entangled states that span the Hilbert space of interest.",
