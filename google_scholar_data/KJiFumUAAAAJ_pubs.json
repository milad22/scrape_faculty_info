            "We propose a robust wavelet domain method for noise filtering in medical images. The proposed method adapts itself to various types of image noise as well as to the preference of the medical expert; a single parameter can be used to balance the preservation of (expert-dependent) relevant details against the degree of noise reduction. The algorithm exploits generally valid knowledge about the correlation of significant image features across the resolution scales to perform a preliminary coefficient classification. This preliminary coefficient classification is used to empirically estimate the statistical distributions of the coefficients that represent useful image features on the one hand and mainly noise on the other. The adaptation to the spatial context in the image is achieved by using a wavelet domain indicator of the local spatial activity. The proposed method is of low complexity, both in its implementation and \u2026",

The core of our approach is the estimation of the probability that a given coefficient contains a significant noise-free component, which we call \"signal of interest\". In this respect, we analyze cases where the probability of signal presence is 1) fixed per subband, 2) conditioned on a local spatial context, and 3) conditioned on information from multiple image bands. All the probabilities are estimated assuming a generalized Laplacian prior for noise-free subband data and additive white Gaussian noise. The results demonstrate that the new subband-adaptive shrinkage function outperforms Bayesian thresholding approaches in terms of mean-squared error. The spatially adaptive version of the proposed method yields better results than the existing spatially adaptive ones of similar and \u2026",

In the last few decades, various segmentation techniques of different accuracy and degree of complexity have been developed and reported in the literature. In this paper we review the most popular methods commonly used for brain MRI segmentation. We highlight differences between them and discuss their capabilities, advantages, and limitations. To address the complexity and challenges of the brain MRI segmentation problem, we first introduce the basic concepts of image segmentation. Then, we explain different MRI preprocessing steps including image registration, bias field correction, and removal of nonbrain tissue. Finally, after reviewing different brain MRI segmentation methods, we discuss the validation problem in brain MRI segmentation.",

The first stage computes a fuzzy derivative for eight different directions. The second stage uses these fuzzy derivatives to perform fuzzy smoothing by weighting the contributions of neighboring pixel values. Both stages are based on fuzzy rules which make use of membership functions. The filter can be applied iteratively to effectively reduce heavy noise. In particular, the shape of the membership functions is adapted according to the remaining noise level after each iteration, making use of the distribution of the homogeneity in the image. A statistical model for the noise distribution can be incorporated to relate the homogeneity to the adaptation scheme of the membership functions.

The new method combines three criteria for distinguishing supposedly useful coefficients from noise: coefficient magnitudes, their evolution across scales and spatial clustering of large coefficients near image edges. These three criteria are combined in a Bayesian framework. The spatial clustering properties are expressed in a prior model. The statistical properties concerning coefficient magnitudes and their evolution across scales are expressed in a joint conditional model. The three main novelties with respect to related approaches are (1) the interscale-ratios of wavelet coefficients are statistically characterized and different local criteria for distinguishing useful coefficients from noise are evaluated, (2) a joint conditional model is introduced, and (3) a novel anisotropic Markov random field prior \u2026",

This filter exploits the repetitive character of structures in an image, unlike conventional denoising algorithms, which typically operate in a local neighbourhood. Even though the method is quite intuitive and potentially very powerful, the PSNR and visual results are somewhat inferior to other recent state-of-the-art non-local algorithms, like KSVD and BM-3D. In this paper, we show that the NLMeans algorithm is basically the first iteration of the Jacobi optimization algorithm for robustly estimating the noise-free image. Based on this insight, we present additional improvements to the NLMeans algorithm and also an extension to noise reduction of coloured (correlated) noise. For white noise, PSNR results show that the proposed method is very competitive with the BM-3D method, while the visual quality of our method is better due to the lower presence of artifacts. For correlated noise on the other hand, we obtain a significant improvement in denoising performance compared to recent wavelet-based techniques.",

            "We propose a novel semisupervised local discriminant analysis method for feature extraction in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, with improved performance in both ill-posed and poor-posed conditions. The proposed method combines unsupervised methods (local linear feature extraction methods and supervised method (linear discriminant analysis) in a novel framework without any free parameters. The underlying idea is to design an optimal projection matrix, which preserves the local neighborhood information inferred from unlabeled samples, while simultaneously maximizing the class discrimination of the data inferred from the labeled samples. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with conventional feature extraction methods.",
