            "The generalized parton distributions, introduced nearly a decade ago, have emerged as a universal tool to describe hadrons in terms of quark and gluonic degrees of freedom. They combine the features of form factors, parton densities and distribution amplitudes\u2014the functions used for a long time in studies of hadronic structure. Generalized parton distributions are analogous to the phase-space Wigner quasi-probability function of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics which encodes full information on a quantum-mechanical system. We give an extensive review of main achievements in the development of this formalism. We discuss physical interpretation and basic properties of generalized parton distributions, their modeling and QCD evolution in the leading and next-to-leading orders. We describe how these functions enter a wide class of exclusive reactions, such as electro- and photo-production of photons \u2026",

We show that these interactions give rise to gauge invariance of the transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions. As compared to previous analyses, our study demonstrates the existence of extra scaling contributions from transverse components of the gauge potential at the light-cone infinity. They form a transverse gauge link which is indispensable for restoration of the gauge invariance of parton distributions in the light-cone gauge where the gauge potential does not vanish asymptotically. Our finding helps to explain a number of features observed in a model calculation of structure functions in the light-cone gauge.",
