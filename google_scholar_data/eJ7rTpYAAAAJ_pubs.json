            "The recently commissioned Linac Coherent Light Source is an X-ray free-electron laser at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. It produces coherent soft and hard X-rays with peak brightness nearly ten orders of magnitude beyond conventional synchrotron sources and a range of pulse durations from 500 to< 10 fs (10\u2212 15 s). With these beam characteristics this light source is capable of imaging the structure and dynamics of matter at atomic size and timescales. The facility is now operating at X-ray wavelengths from 22 to 1.2 \u00c5 and is presently delivering this high-brilliance beam to a growing array of scientific researchers.

The free-electron laser process at LCLS is based on self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) where spontaneous emission from the initial electron beam shot noise is amplified by its interaction with the electrons over a long magnetic undulator. Although SASE is very effective, producing tremendously powerful, ultrashort X-ray beams, the start-up from noise leaves poor temporal coherence and a broad, noisy spectrum. We present experimental results of a new method, suggested by colleagues at DESY, allowing self-seeding using X-rays from the first half of the undulator to seed the second half through a diamond-based monochromator, producing near Fourier-transform-limited X-ray pulses with 0.4\u20130.5 eV bandwidth \u2026",

Here we report the time-resolved measurements of X-ray free-electron lasers by using an X-band radiofrequency transverse deflector at the Linac Coherent Light Source. We demonstrate this method to be a simple, non-invasive technique with a large dynamic range for single-shot electron and X-ray temporal characterization. A resolution of less than 1 fs root mean square has been achieved for soft X-ray pulses.

            "We report the first measurements of x-ray single-pulse duration and two-pulse separation at the Linac Coherent Light Source using a cross-correlation technique involving x rays and electrons. An emittance-spoiling foil is adopted as a very simple and effective method to control the output x-ray pulse. A minimum pulse duration of about 3 fs full width at half maximum has been measured together with a controllable pulse separation (delay) between two pulses. This technique provides critical temporal diagnostics for x-ray experiments such as x-ray pump-probe studies.",
