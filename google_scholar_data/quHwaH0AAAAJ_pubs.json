            "Research on \u201cepistemological beliefs\u201d has made important contributions to education, most fundamentally in identifying epistemology as a category of informal knowledge that may play a role in students\u2019 knowledge, reasoning, study strategies, and participation. A perspective on students as having epistemological beliefs can provide an alternative interpretive lens for teachers to use in understanding their students\u2019 ideas and behavior, in assessing students\u2019 abilities and needs, and in adapting their plans and strategies for instruction. This value of the perspective in opening a new category of instructional perception and intention has not been sensitive to the details of the perspective. At this point, however, further progress will depend on those details. In this chapter, we contend that current perspectives on epistemologies are problematic in their form, or \u201contology.\u201d We will focus our arguments primarily on epistemological beliefs about science and science learning, specifically in introductory physics, but our contentions apply to beliefs in other disciplines as well. The study of epistemologies has largely emulated the study of \u201cconceptual understanding,\u201d which has established that students have informal knowledge, about",

            "As researchers studying student reasoning in introductory physics, and as instructors teaching courses, we often focus on whether and how students apply what they know in one context to their reasoning in another. But we do not speak in terms of \u201ctransfer.\u201d The term connotes to us a unitary view of knowledge as a thing that is acquired in one context and carried (or not) to another. We speak, rather, in terms of activating resources, a language with an explicitly manifold view of cognitive structure. In this chapter, we describe this view and argue that it provides a more firm and generative basis for research.In particular, our resources-based perspective accounts for why it is difficult, and perhaps unnecessary, to draw a boundary around the notion of \u201ctransfer\u201d; provides an analytical framework for exploring the differences between active transfer involving metacognition and passive transfer that \u201cjust happens\u201d; helps to explain many results in the transfer literature, such as the rar-",

Debates such as this regarding subtleties of cognitive theory, however, may be difficult to connect to everyday instructional practice. Our purpose in this article is to make that connection. We first review reasons for supporting the latter account, of naive epistemologies as made up of fine-grained, context-sensitive resources; as part of this argument we note that familiar strategies and curricula tacitly ascribe epistemological resources to students. We then present several strategies designed more explicitly to help students tap those resources for learning introductory physics. Finally, we reflect on this work as an example of interplay between 2 modes of inquiry into student thinking, that of instruction and that of formal research on learning.",

Surveys, interview protocols, and other methods used to probe students' beliefs about scientific knowledge broadly reflect this outlook.

            "The notion that students come to science courses with misconceptions has become quite widely accepted by those who follow or participate in education research. DiSessa and his colleagues (diSessa, 1988, 1993; Smith, diSessa, & Roschelle, 1993\/1994) have challenged the theoretical and empirical validity of this perspective and offered an alternative account of cognitive structure in phenomenological primitives or p-prims. The purpose of this article is to further clarify and contrast the two accounts: in particular, to consider their utility and generativity as conceptual tools for teachers. How may each perspective influence instructional perceptions and intentions? The article recounts a discussion about forces and motion from a high-school  physics class, analyzes how a teacher may perceive students' participation in that discussion from either perspective, and considers what, based on those perceptions, the \u2026",

            "Most research on personal epistemologies has conceived them as made up of relatively large, coherent, and stable cognitive structures, either developmental stages or beliefs (perhaps organized into theories). Recent work has challenged these views, arguing that personal epistemologies are better understood as made up of finer grained cognitive resources whose activation depends sensitively on context. In this article, we compare these different frameworks, focusing on their instructional implications by using them to analyze a third-grade teacher's epistemologically motivated intervention and its effect on her students. We argue that the resources framework has more predictive and explanatory power than stage- and beliefs-based frameworks do.",
