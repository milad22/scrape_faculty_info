            "Characterization of amorphous Si, CdTe, and Cu(InGa)Se2\u2010based thin\u2010film solar cells is described with focus on the deviations in device behavior from standard device models. Quantum efficiency (QE), current\u2013voltage (J\u2013V), and admittance measurements are reviewed with regard to aspects of interpretation unique to the thin\u2010film solar cells. In each case, methods are presented for characterizing parasitic effects common in these solar cells in order to identify loss mechanisms and reveal fundamental device properties. Differences between these thin\u2010film solar cells and idealized devices are largely due to a high density of defect states in the absorbing layers and to parasitic losses due to the device structure and contacts. There is also commonly a voltage\u2010dependent photocurrent collection which affects J\u2013V and QE measurements. The voltage and light bias dependence of these measurements can be used to \u2026",

Properties studied include the spatial uniformity, bulk defect response, carrier density, and light-induced metastable effects. These results indicate that previous estimates of carrier densities, from C\u2013V profiling, may be significantly overestimated. In addition, a defect response previously thought to be located at the interface is observed to exist throughout the bulk material. Finally, an infrared light-soaking treatment is demonstrated to induce metastable changes in the bulk CuIn1\u2212xGaxSe2 film. Hence, the drive-level capacitance profiling technique provides valuable insights into these films. Herein, the technique itself is fully explained, compared to other junction capacitance methods, and its utility is demonstrated using numerical \u2026",

            "This paper addresses the effect of substrate temperature (T SS) and deposition profile for Cu (InGa) Se 2 films deposited by multisource elemental evaporation on film structure and solar cell performance. Different temporal Cu flux profiles are utilized to give either a graded deposition incorporating a Cu-rich growth step, with [Cu]>[In]+[Ga], before achieving the final film composition with [Cu]<[In]+[Ga], or a uniform deposition with [Cu]<[In]+[Ga] throughout. The Cu (InGa) Se 2 morphology, including quantitative analysis of the grain size distributions, and the performance of completed solar cells are compared at T SS= 400 and 550\u00b0 C. The higher T SS gives larger grains and better device performance with the best devices obtained in this work having efficiencies of 16.4% for 550\u00b0 C and 14.1% for 400\u00b0 C. At 550\u00b0 C, Cu-rich film growth gives bigger grains than a uniform flux process, but there is no difference in the \u2026",

The most satisfactory overall fit to the data is p\u223c(1\/4 and s\u223c 0, namely Mott VRH. A new criterion is given to decide the temperature regimes where Mott or Efros-Shklovskii VRH (p=(1\/2) should be observed. The characteristic Mott temperature T 0\u221d(1-N\/N c) 3 \u03bd yielded 0.77< \u03bd< 0.97. Strong deviations from VRH behavior were observed for N< 0.84 N c. Metallic samples showed a \u03c3 (n, T)= \u03c3 (n, 0)+ m (n) T 1\/2 dependence at sufficiently low temperatures.
