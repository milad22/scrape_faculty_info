These data are supplemented by existing red and near-infrared spectra (~ 0.6-2.5 \u03bcm), as well as red through mid-infrared spectroscopy of seven other L and T dwarfs presented by Cushing et al. We compare these spectra to those generated from the model atmospheres of Saumon & Marley. The models reproduce the observed spectra well, except in the case of one very red L3. 5 dwarf, 2MASS J22244381\u20130158521. The broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almost independently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in our models: effective temperature (T eff), surface gravity, grain sedimentation efficiency (f sed), and vertical gas transport efficiency (K zz).

We present model geometric albedo and phase-integral spectra and Bond albedos for planets and brown dwarfs with masses between 0.8 and 70 Jupiter masses. Rayleigh scattering predominates in the blue while molecular absorption removes most red and infrared photons. Thus cloud-free atmospheres, found on giant planets with effective temperatures exceeding about 400 K, are quite dark in reflected light beyond 0.6 \u03bcm. In cooler atmospheres, first water clouds and then other condensates provide a bright reflecting layer. Only planets with cloudy atmospheres will be detectable in reflected light beyond 1 \u03bcm. Thermal emission dominates the near-infrared for warm objects with clear atmospheres. However the presence of other condensates, not considered here \u2026",

            "In the last few years a significant population of ultracool L and T dwarfs has been discovered. With effective temperatures ranging from~ 2200 to 700 K, these objects emit most of their radiation in the near\u2010IR, and their spectral energy distributions are dominated by strong molecular absorption bands. These highly structured energy distributions lead to JHK magnitudes that are extremely sensitive to the exact filter bandpass used. In the case of the T dwarfs, the differences between commonly used photometric systems can be as large as 0.4 mag at J and 0.5 mag at J\u2212 K. Near\u2010IR magnitudes have been published for L and T dwarfs using a variety of photometric systems. Currently, the data obtained with these systems cannot be accurately compared or combined, as transformations based on the colors of hotter stars are not valid for L and T dwarfs. To address this problem, we have synthesized J, H, and K \u2026",

The heliocentric inclinations of the objects we observed range from 0.6\u00b0\u201334\u00b0. We find a very strong anticorrelation of binaries with inclination. Of the 58 targets that have inclinations of less than 5.5\u00b0, 17 are binary, a binary fraction of 29\u00b17 6%. All 17 are similar-brightness systems. On the contrary, only 4 of the 42 objects with inclinations greater than 5.5\u00b0 have satellites and only 1 of these is a similar-brightness binary.

Using PSF fitting we have identified six likely binaries in addition to the three new binaries already found in this data set. We find that 11% of trans-Neptunian objects are binaries at the separation and brightness limits of NIC2. The identification of these new binaries significantly increases the known lower limit to the binary fraction among trans-Neptunian objects. The origin of such a high fraction of binaries remains to be determined.
