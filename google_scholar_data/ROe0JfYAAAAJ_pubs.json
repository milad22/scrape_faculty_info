            "The Galchhi shear zone underlies the Kathmandu klippe in central Nepal and has emerged as a key structure for discriminating competing models for the formation of the Himalayan orogenic wedge. New chronologic data from the Galchhi area suggest a new structural and orogenic interpretation. Zircons from quartzites and an orthogneiss restrict protolith deposition to between 467\u2009+\u20097\/\u2009\u2212\u200910\u2009Ma and ~570\u2009Ma, with metamorphic zircon growth at 23\u201329\u2009Ma. Comparable data from the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) at the intra\u2010GHS Langtang thrust, north of Galchhi, similarly restrict GHS deposition to between 475\u2009+\u20097\/ \u2212 3 and ~660\u2009Ma. Undeformed pegmatites near Galchhi constrain movement of the Galchhi shear zone to \u226522.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u2009Ma, long before slip of the Main Central Thrust in the region (\u226417\u2009Ma).

Integrated U\u2010Pb ages, Hf isotopic, and whole rock trace element data establish that the Askot klippe, in northwest India, is composed of Paleoproterozoic lower Lesser Himalayan rocks, not Greater Himalayan rocks, as previously interpreted. The Askot klippe consists of 1857\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u2009Ma granite\u2010granodiorite gneiss, coeval 1878\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u2009Ma felsic volcanic rock, and circa 1800\u2009Ma Berinag quartzite, representing a small vestige of a Paleoproterozoic (circa 1850\u2009Ma) continental arc, formed on northern margin of the north Indian cratonic block. Detrital zircon from Berinag quartzite shows \u03b5Hf1850\u2009Ma values between \u22129.6 and \u22121.1 (an average of \u22124.5) and overlaps with \u03b5Hf1850\u2009Ma values of the Askot klippe granite\u2010granodiorite gneiss (\u22125.5 to \u22121.2, with an average of \u22122.7) and other \u2026",

The Main Central thrust (MCT) is at the base of the GH with the Lesser Himalayan (LH) Robang Formation in the footwall, which is the hanging wall of the Ramgarh\u2013Munsiari thrust (RMT). At Kodari-Tatopani and Malekhu, U\u2013Pb detrital zircon age populations from the RMT sheet yield a maximum depositional age of c. 1838 and c. 1871 Ma. U\u2013Pb analyses of igneous zircons from the RMT sheet yield a crystallization age of c. 1750 Ma at both Galchhi and Kodari-Tatopani. The \u03b5Nd(0) values of pelitic rocks from the RMT sheet at Kodari-Tatopani range from c. \u221223 to \u221225; whereas, GH rocks have values from c. \u221212 to \u221218.

A continuous Eocene to Miocene sequence is exposed along the Jowai-Badarpur Road (NH-44). The study area is at the junction between Assam and Bengal basins. Detrital history from this area provides data pertaining to uplift and erosional history of the hinterland areas (i.e., Himalayas, Indo-Burma Ranges and Shillong Plateau).  Lower Cenozoic units from the study area bear signatures of the both orogenic belts and stable craton. Lower Eocene Tura and Sylhet sandstones are quartzose (Q98F2L0), which points to the Indian Craton as a potential source area. Sandstones from the late Eocene Kopili Formation are quartzolithic (Q73F4L23). Younger Oligocene and   Miocene sandstones are also quartzolithic, rich in unstable grains, suggesting derivation from adjacent orogenic belts.   Eocene sandstones are rich in opaque and ultra-stable heavy minerals (e.g., zircon, rutile, and tourmaline). Concentrations of unstable heavy minerals (e.g., amphibole, chrome-spinel, and serpentine) increase in Oligocene and Miocene strata. Progressively lower maturity indices of heavy mineral assemblages in up-section suggest that the orogenic fronts are getting closer.  Mineral chemistry of detrital tourmaline grains suggests that derivation from metapelites with a subordinate Li-poor granitoid source. The majority of the detrital tourmalines belong to the schorl-dravite series. Low Al, low Fe, and high Mg-bearing chrome spinels suggest derivation \u2026",
