            "New treatments for HIV can improve immune functioning and decrease mortality. However, lapses in adherence may render these complex regimens ineffective. Sixty-three men and 9 women on highly active antiretroviral therapy completed measures of medication adherence, psychological characteristics, and barriers to adherence. HIV viral load, a health outcome measure of virus amount present in blood, was also obtained. The sample was 36% African American and 56% Caucasian, with 35% reporting disability. Nearly one third of patients had missed medication doses in the past 5 days, and 18% had missed doses weekly over the past 3 months. Frequency of missed doses was strongly related to detectable HIV viral loads. Depression, side-effect severity, self-efficacy, and social support distinguished patients with good and poor adherence. Barriers also varied with adherence level. Implications for \u2026",

PARTICIPANTS: Community sample of HIV-seropositive men (n=138) and women (n=44) currently taking a triple-drug combination of antiretroviral therapies for HIV infection; 60% were ethnic minorities, and 73% had been diagnosed with AIDS. MEASUREMENTS: An adapted form of the Test of Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), a comprehensive health and treatment interview that included 2-day recall of treatment adherence and reasons for nonadherence, and measures of substance abuse, social support, emotional distress, and attitudes toward primary care providers.

Psychological distress associated with HIV infection may compound the adjustment difficulties and increase the barriers to care associated with living in poverty. The authors surveyed 100 women who were receiving HIV care at a public hospital in the southeastern United States on measures of depression, anxiety, life stress, social support, and coping; they also assessed demographic and medical characteristics of the sample. Participants' annual incomes were low (87% < $10,000), and most participants were minorities (84% African American).

There is evidence that many factors determine medication adherence, including adherence self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to adhere) and relations with health care providers. However, there are no studies that examine how these two factors relate to each other and their subsequent influence on HIV medication adherence. The goal of the current analysis was to explore a model of medication adherence in which the relationship between positive provider interactions and adherence is mediated by adherence self-efficacy.

            "Non-adherence to medical regimens is a critical threat to the health of HIV-infected individuals. Patients who do not adhere to routine medical care cannot fully benefit from the increasingly efficacious treatments available to them. Consistent attendance at medical appointments plays a central role in both prolonging life and enhancing quality of life for persons living with HIV\/AIDS. By identifying why many patients do not reliably attend medical services, interventions can be undertaken to improve appointment-keeping. The primary purpose of the present study was to identify factors predictive of HIV-related medical appointment attendance. One-hundred-and-forty-four outpatients in a public hospital ambulatory care HIV clinic were followed for seven months. Demographic, medical care and psychosocial factors were measured in order to prospectively predict the percentage of missed clinic appointments by persons \u2026",

            "To assess the construct validity and reliability of the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines survey.Cross-sectional survey of parents of 19\u201335 month old children in a closed model HMO. We used factor analysis to confirm survey sub-domains and Cronbach's \u03b1 to determine the internal consistency reliability of sub-domain scales. Construct validity was assessed by linking parental responses to their child's immunization record.Our response rate was 46% (N = 230). Factor analysis identified 3 factors that explained 70% of the total variance for the 18 survey items. We deleted 3 items that failed to load highly (>.4) on an identified factor, correlated poorly with other items, or had a hesitant response that was not associated with increased under-immunization. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients for the 3 sub-domain scales created by grouping the remaining 15 items were .74, .84, and .74 \u2026",
