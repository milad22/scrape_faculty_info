Over the past several years, tremendous progress in the printing and transfer of single-crystalline, inorganic micro-and nanostructures on plastic substrates has been achieved through various process schemes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. For instance, contact printing of parallel arrays of semiconductor nanowires (NWs) has been explored as a versatile route to enable fabrication of high-performance, bendable transistors and sensors 11, 12, 13, 14. However, truly macroscale integration of ordered NW circuitry has not yet been demonstrated, with the largest-scale active systems being of the order of 1 cm 2 (refs 11, 15). This limitation is in part due to assembly-and processing-related obstacles, although larger-scale integration has been \u2026",

In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in developing photovoltaics that can be potentially mass deployed 1, 2, 3. Of particular interest to cost-effective solar cells is to use novel device structures and materials processing for enabling acceptable efficiencies 4, 5, 6. In this regard, here, we report the direct growth of highly regular, single-crystalline nanopillar arrays of optically active semiconductors on aluminium substrates that are then configured as solar-cell modules. As an example, we demonstrate a photovoltaic structure that incorporates three-dimensional, single-crystalline n-CdS nanopillars, embedded in polycrystalline thin films of p-CdTe, to enable high absorption of light and efficient collection of the carriers.

The field-effect mobility is found to monotonically decrease as the radius is reduced to <10 nm, with the low temperature transport data clearly highlighting the drastic impact of the surface roughness scattering on the mobility degradation for miniaturized nanowires.

Here, we present a novel strategy for controlled, nanoscale doping of semiconductor materials by taking advantage of the crystalline nature of silicon and its rich, self-limiting surface reaction properties. Our method relies on the formation of a highly uniform and covalently bonded monolayer of dopant-containing molecules, which enables deterministic positioning of dopant atoms on the Si surfaces. In a subsequent annealing step, the dopant atoms are diffused into the Si lattice to attain the desired doping profile. We show the versatility of our approach through controlled p-and n-doping of a wide range of semiconductor materials, including ultrathin \u2026",
