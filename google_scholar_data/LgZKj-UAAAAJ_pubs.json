            "The antioxidant activity of wheatgrass, which is consumed as a dietary supplement, was estimated at different levels. The methods employed include FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power), ABTS (2,2\u2032\u2010azobis\u20103\u2010ethylbenzthiazoline\u20106\u2010sulfonic acid) and DPPH (1,1\u2032\u2010diphenyl\u20102\u2010picrylhydrazyl) assays. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of wheatgrass grown under different conditions over a period of 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15 days were used. Lipid peroxidation and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were determined and utilized to check the potency of a few selected extracts. Different conditions used for growth were (1) tap water, (2) tap water with nutrients, (3) soil and tap water, and (4) soil with nutrients. For comparison, a commercially available wheatgrass tablet was analysed. To explain the reasons behind the observed differences, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts were measured \u2026",

There was a strong positive relationship between the selenium content in shoots and that in kernels, showing that grain selenium concentration can be predicted from that in the vegetative tissues of the plant. The identity and content of the selenocompounds in the grain samples and in wheat-based reference materials were investigated by HPLC\u2212ICP\u2212dynamic reaction cell\u2212MS. Reversed-phase, cation exchange, and anion exchange HPLC were used to separate the selenium species after ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction with an ultrasonic probe.

            "A color changeable optode for Hg(II) was prepared by the immobilization of a dye 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) and a liquid ion-exchanger trioctylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat-336) in the tri-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate plasticized cellulose triacetate matrix. Hg(II) and CH3Hg+ from aqueous samples could be quantitatively preconcentrated in this transparent optode producing a distinct color change (\u03bbmax = 520 nm) within 5 min equilibration time in bicarbonate aqueous medium or 30 min in natural water. Whereas optode sample without Aliquat-336 did not change its color corresponding to Hg\u2013PAR complex on equilibrium with the same aqueous solution containing Hg(II) ions. The uptake of Hg(II) was found to be pH dependant with a maximum (>90%) at a pH 7.5. The uptake of ions like Cu(II), Fe(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) was negligible in the optode where as the uptake of Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions was 10\u201315% at pH \u2026",
