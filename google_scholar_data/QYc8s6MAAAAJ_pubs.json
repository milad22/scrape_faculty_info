The resulting alloyed CsPb0.64Zn0.36I3 nanocrystals exhibited an improved, close-to-unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.5% due to the increased radiative decay rate and the decreased non-radiative decay rate. They also showed an enhanced stability, which correlated with improved effective Goldschmidt tolerance factors, by the incorporation of Zn2+ ions with a smaller radius than the Pb2+ ions. Simultaneously, the nanocrystals switched from n-type (for CsPbI3) to nearly ambipolar for the alloyed nanoparticles. The hole injection barrier of electroluminescent LEDs was effectively eliminated by using alloyed CsPb0.64Zn0.36I3 nanocrystals, and a high peak external quantum efficiency of 15.1% has been achieved.",

We demonstrate LEDs based on Ag doped\u2013passivated CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals with external quantum efficiency of 11.2% and an improved stability. Ag and trilayer MoO3\/Au\/MoO3 structure were used as cathode and anode, respectively, which reduce the electron injection barrier and ensure the high transparency and low resistance of the anode. Silver ions diffuse into perovskite film from the Ag electrode, as confirmed by the elemental mapping, the presence of Ag 3d peaks in the X-ray photoelectron spectrum, and the peak shift in the X-ray diffraction patterns of CsPbI3. In addition to doping, silver ions play the beneficial role of passivating surface defect states of CsPbI3 nanocrystals, which results in increased photoluminescence quantum yield, elongated \u2026",

The SrCl2 is chosen as the dopant to synthesize the CsPbI3 NCs. Because the ion radius of Sr2+ (1.18 \u00c5) is slightly smaller than that of Pb2+ (1.19 \u00c5) ions, divalent Sr2+ cations can partly replace the Pb2+ ions in the lattice structure of perovskite NCs and cause a slight lattice contraction. At the same time, Cl\u2212 anions from SrCl2 are able to efficiently passivate surface defect states of CsPbI3 nanocrystals, thus converting nonradiative trap states to radiative states. The simultaneous Sr2+ ion doping and surface Cl\u2212 ion passivation result in the enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 84%), elongated emission lifetime, and improved stability.

However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is low, primarily as a result of the NC surface defects. Here, we report a method to reduce the surface defects by capping CsPbI3 NCs with PbS. This passivation significantly enhanced the PL efficiency, reduced the Stokes shift, narrowed the PL bandwidth, and increased the stability of CsPbI3 NCs. At the same time, CsPbI3 NC films switched from n-type behavior to nearly ambipolar by PbS capping, which allowed us to fabricate electroluminescence LEDs using p\u2013i\u2013n structures. The thus-fabricated LEDs exhibited dramatically improved storage and operation stability, and an EQE of 11.8%. These results suggest that, with a suitable surface passivation strategy, the \u2026",

Herein, a selective surface defect elimination process with the help of hydrated nitrates was introduced into the perovskite\/toluene solution to strip the undesired surface defects and vacancies and to boost the photoluminescence quantum yield of true-blue-light-emitting (at 466 nm) CsPb(Cl\/Br)3 perovskite nanocrystals to the impressive value of 85%. Unlike the conventional passivation strategy, the anionic nitrate ions are able to desorb the undesired surface metallic lead and combine with excess surface metal ions, leaving perovskite quantum dots with better crystallinity and fewer surface defects.",
