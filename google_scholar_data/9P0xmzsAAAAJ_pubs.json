We present a unified and simple prescription for identifying these operators, using tools similar to those employed in two-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetry. In particular we rely on the work of Shifman and Vainshtein relating the \u03b2-function of the gauge coupling to the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields. Finite N = 1 models, which have marginal operators at zero coupling, are easily identified using our approach. The method can also be employed to find manifolds of fixed points which do not include the free theory; these are seen in certain models with product gauge groups and in many non-renormalizable effective theories. For a number of our models, S-duality may have interesting implications. Using the fact that relevant perturbations often cause one manifold of \u2026",

We have found that, for the Higgs-boson mass smaller than the masses of W and Z bosons, the phase transition is of the first order.

In this paper, we concentrate on a non-trivial Z 2\u00d7 Z 2 example. We show that consistency conditions, arising from tadpole cancellation and algebraic sources, require the existence of three sets of Dirichlet 5-branes. We discuss fully the enhancements of the spectrum when these 5-branes intersect. An amusing attribute of these models is the importance of the tree-level (in type I language) superpotential to the consistent relationship between Higgsing and the motions of 5-branes.",
