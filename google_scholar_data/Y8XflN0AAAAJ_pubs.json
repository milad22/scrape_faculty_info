X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and optical absorption are consistent with nanocrystals containing a core of nearly monodisperse CdSe of 27\u221230 \u00c5 diameter with a ZnS capping 6 \u00b1 3 \u00c5 thick. The ZnS capping with a higher bandgap than CdSe passivates the core crystallite removing the surface traps. The nanocrystals exhibit strong and stable band-edge luminescence with a 50% quantum yield at room temperature. ",

            "The seed-mediated growth of gold nanostructures is shown to be strongly dependent on the gold seed nanocrystal structure. The gold seed solutions can be prepared such that the seeds are either single crystalline or multiply twinned. With added silver(I) in the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) aqueous growth solutions, the two types of seeds yield either nanorods or elongated bipyramidal nanoparticles, in good yields. The gold nanorods are single crystalline, with a structure similar to those synthesized electrochemically (Yu, Y. Y. et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 1997, 101, 6661). In contrast, the gold bipyramids are pentatwinned. These bipyramids are strikingly monodisperse in shape. This leads to the sharpest ensemble longitudinal plasmon resonance reported so far for metal colloid solutions, with an inhomogeneous width as narrow as 0.13 eV for a resonance at \u223c1.5 eV.

Today\u2019s strong research focus on NCs has been prompted by the tremendous progress in their synthesis. Impressively narrow size distributions of just a few percent, rational shape-engineering, compositional modulation, electronic doping, and tailored surface chemistries are now feasible for a broad range of inorganic compounds. The performance of inorganic NC-based photovoltaic and light-emitting devices has become competitive to other state-of-the-art materials. Semiconductor NCs hold unique promise for near- and mid-infrared technologies, where very few semiconductor materials are available.

            "Second-harmonic generation from an interface, in relation to the second-order nonlinearities of the interface layer and the adjacent bulk, is considered. It is shown that both structural asymmetry and field discontinuity contribute to the interface nonlinearity, which, as far as second-harmonic generation is concerned, can be characterized by a local surface nonlinear susceptibility tensor. The bulk nonlinearity may also contribute to the second-harmonic signal, but is an order of magnitude weaker than the surface nonlinearity in centrosymmetric media with a large optical dielectric constant. The possibility of detecting submonolayers of adsorbates on various substrates is discussed qualitatively.",

            "Hot electrons in semiconductors lose their energy very quickly (within picoseconds) to lattice vibrations. Slowing this energy loss could prove useful for more efficient photovoltaic or infrared devices. With their well-separated electronic states, quantum dots should display slow relaxation, but other mechanisms have made it difficult to observe. We report slow intraband relaxation (>1 nanosecond) in colloidal quantum dots. The small cadmium selenide (CdSe) dots, with an intraband energy separation of \u223c0.25 electron volts, are capped by an epitaxial zinc selenide (ZnSe) shell. The shell is terminated by a CdSe passivating layer to remove electron traps and is covered by ligands of low infrared absorbance (alkane thiols) at the intraband energy. We found that relaxation is markedly slowed with increasing ZnSe shell thickness.",
