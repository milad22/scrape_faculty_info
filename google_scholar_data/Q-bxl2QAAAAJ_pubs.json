CTA has ambitions science goals, for which it is necessary to achieve full-sky coverage, to improve the sensitivity by about an order of magnitude, to span about four decades of energy, from a few tens of GeV to above 100 TeV with enhanced angular and energy resolutions over existing VHE gamma-ray observatories. An international collaboration has formed with more than 1000 members from 27 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America. In 2010 the CTA Consortium completed a Design Study and started a three-year Preparatory Phase which leads to production readiness of CTA in 2014.

Since the observed neutrino flux is comparable to the diffuse \u03b3-ray background flux obtained by Fermi, we place new, strong upper limits on the source spectral index, \u0393\u2272 2.1\u20132.2. In addition, the new IceCube data imply that these sources contribute at least 30%\u201340% of the diffuse \u03b3-ray background in the 100 GeV range and even\u223c 100% for softer spectra. Our results, which are insensitive to details of the p p source models, are one of the first strong examples of the multimessenger approach combining the measured neutrino and \u03b3-ray fluxes. The p p origin of the IceCube signal can further be tested by constraining \u0393 with sub-PeV neutrino observations, by unveiling the sub-TeV diffuse \u03b3-ray background and by observing such p p sources with TeV \u03b3-ray \u2026",

We obtain simple, useful constraints, using the often overlooked point that shock acceleration of particles is ineffective at radiation-mediated shocks. Classical GRBs may be too powerful to produce high-energy neutrinos inside stars, which is consistent with IceCube nondetections. We find that ultralong GRBs avoid such constraints and detecting the TeV signal will support giant progenitors. Predictions for low-power GRB classes including low-luminosity GRBs can be consistent with the astrophysical neutrino background IceCube may detect, with a spectral steepening around PeV. The models can be tested with future GRB monitors.",

Since GRB 060218 is very near, \u223c140 Mpc, and very dim, the 1 yr observation by Swift suggests that the rate of GRB 060218\u2013like events might be very high so that such low\u2010luminosity (LL) GRBs might form a different population from the cosmological high\u2010luminosity (HL) GRBs. We found that the high\u2010energy neutrino background from LL GRBs could be comparable with that from HL GRBs. If each neutrino event is detected by IceCube, later optical\u2010infrared follow\u2010up observations such as those by Subaru and HST can possibly identify a Type Ibc supernova associated with LL GRBs, even if gamma rays and X\u2010rays are not observed by Swift.

Their neutrino spectrum has a cutoff feature around PeV energies since target photons are due to Ly \u03b1 emission. Because of infrared photons provided by the dust torus, neutrino spectra above PeV energies are too hard to be consistent with the IceCube data unless the proton spectral index is steeper than 2.5, or the maximum proton energy is\u2272 100 PeV.

With these general multimessenger arguments, we find that the latest data suggest a population of cosmic-ray accelerators hidden in GeV-TeV \u03b3 rays as a neutrino origin.

The scientific potential of CTA is extremely broad: from understanding the role of relativistic cosmic particles to the search for dark matter. CTA is an explorer of the extreme universe, probing environments from the immediate neighbourhood of black holes to cosmic voids on the largest scales. Covering a huge range in photon energy from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, CTA will improve on all aspects of performance with respect to current instruments. The observatory will operate arrays on sites in both hemispheres to provide full sky coverage and will hence maximize the potential for the rarest phenomena such as very nearby supernovae, gamma-ray bursts or gravitational wave transients. With 99 telescopes on the southern site and 19 telescopes on the northern site, flexible operation will be possible, with sub-arrays available for specific tasks. CTA will have important synergies with many of the new generation of major astronomical and astroparticle observatories. Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches combining CTA data with those from other instruments will lead to a deeper understanding of the broad-band non-thermal properties of target sources. The CTA Observatory will be operated as an open, proposal-driven observatory, with all data available on a public archive after a pre-defined proprietary period.

            "High energy neutrino emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is discussed. In this paper, by using the simulation kit GEANT4, we calculate proton cooling efficiency including pion-multiplicity and proton-inelasticity in photomeson production. First, we estimate the maximum energy of accelerated protons in GRBs. Using the obtained results, neutrino flux from one burst and a diffuse neutrino background are evaluated quantitatively. We also take account of cooling processes of pion and muon, which are crucial for resulting neutrino spectra. We confirm the validity of analytic approximate treatments on GRB fiducial parameter sets, but also find that the effects of multiplicity and high-inelasticity can be important on both proton cooling and resulting spectra in some cases. Finally, assuming that the GRB rate traces the star formation rate, we obtain a diffuse neutrino background spectrum from GRBs for specific parameter \u2026",
