            "An immunosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using protein G was developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium. A protein G layer was fabricated by binding chemically to self-assembly monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) on gold (Au) surface. The formation of protein G layer on Au surface modified with 11-MUA and the binding of antibody and antigen in series were confirmed by SPR spectroscopy. The effect of detergent such as Tween-20 on binding efficiency of antibody and antigen was investigated by SPR. The binding efficiency of antigen to the antibody immobilized on Au surface was improved up to about 85% and 100% by using protein G and Tween-20, respectively. The surface morphology analyses of 11-MUA monolayer on Au substrate, protein G layer on 11-MUA monolayer and antibody layer immobilized on protein G layer were performed by atomic \u2026",

A self-assembled protein G layer on gold (Au) surface was fabricated by adsorbing a mixture of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and hexanethiol (molar ratio of 1:2) and the activation process for chemical binding between free amine (\ue5f8NH2) of protein G and 11-(MUA) using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) in series. The formation of self-assembled protein G layer on Au substrate and the binding of antibody and antigen in series were confirmed by SPR spectroscopy.
