            "Cells are active systems with molecular force generation that drives complex dynamics at the supramolecular scale. We present a quantitative study of molecular motions in cells over times from milliseconds to hours. Noninvasive tracking was accomplished by imaging highly stable near-infrared luminescence of single-walled carbon nanotubes targeted to kinesin-1 motor proteins in COS-7 cells. We observed a regime of active random \u201cstirring\u201d that constitutes an intermediate mode of transport, different from both thermal diffusion and directed motor activity. High-frequency motion was found to be thermally driven. At times greater than 100 milliseconds, nonequilibrium dynamics dominated. In addition to directed transport along microtubules, we observed strong random dynamics driven by myosins that result in enhanced nonspecific transport. We present a quantitative model connecting molecular mechanisms to \u2026",

Living systems function out of equilibrium and are characterized by directed fluxes through chemical states, which violate detailed balance at the molecular scale. Here we introduce a method to probe for broken detailed balance and demonstrate how such nonequilibrium dynamics are manifest at the mesosopic scale. The periodic beating of an isolated flagellum from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits probability flux in the phase space of shapes. With a model, we show how the breaking of detailed balance can also be quantified in stationary, nonequilibrium stochastic systems in the absence of periodic motion. We further demonstrate such broken detailed balance in the nonperiodic fluctuations of \u2026",

            "The thermal motion of stiff filaments in a crowded environment is highly constrained and anisotropic; it underlies the behavior of such disparate systems as polymer materials, nanocomposites, and the cell cytoskeleton. Despite decades of theoretical study, the fundamental dynamics of such systems remains a mystery. Using near-infrared video microscopy, we studied the thermal diffusion of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) confined in porous agarose networks. We found that even a small bending flexibility of SWNTs strongly enhances their motion: The rotational diffusion constant is proportional to the filament-bending compliance and is independent of the network pore size. The interplay between crowding and thermal bending implies that the notion of a filament\u2019s stiffness depends on its confinement. Moreover, the mobility of SWNTs and other inclusions can be controlled by tailoring their \u2026",

To power these currents, the entropy of the reservoirs increases. The rate of entropy production, or dissipation, is a measure of the statistical irreversibility of the nonequilibrium process. By measuring this irreversibility in several biological systems, recent experiments have detected that particular systems are not in equilibrium. Here we discuss three strategies to replace binary classification (equilibrium versus nonequilibrium) with a quantification of the entropy production rate. To illustrate, we generate time-series data for the evolution of an analytically tractable bead-spring model. Probability currents can be inferred and utilized to indirectly quantify the entropy production rate, but this approach requires prohibitive amounts of data in high-dimensional systems.

Endogenous embedded semiflexible filaments such as microtubules, or added filaments such as single-walled carbon nanotubes are used as novel tools to noninvasively track equilibrium and nonequilibrium fluctuations in such biopolymer networks. Here, we analytically calculate shape fluctuations of semiflexible probe filaments in a viscoelastic environment, driven out of equilibrium by motor activity. Transverse bending fluctuations of the probe filaments can be decomposed into dynamic normal modes. We find that these modes no longer evolve independently under nonequilibrium driving.

Mechanical resilience of animal cells is largely controlled by the actomyosin cortex. The cortex provides stability but is, at the same time, highly adaptable due to rapid turnover of its components. Dynamic functions involve regulated transitions between different steady states of the cortex. We find that model actomyosin cortices, constructed to maintain turnover, self-organize into distinct nonequilibrium steady states when we vary cross-link density.
