Accretion shocks arise in core\u2010collapse supernovae (the focus of this paper), star formation, and accreting white dwarfs and neutron stars. We present a simple analytic model and use time\u2010dependent hydrodynamics simulations to show that this solution is stable to radial perturbations. In two dimensions we show that small perturbations to a spherical shock front can lead to rapid growth of turbulence behind the shock, driven by the injection of vorticity from the now nonspherical shock. We discuss the ramifications this instability may have for the supernova mechanism.",

Immediately after the explosion has been launched, a region of low density and high entropy forms behind the ejecta, which is continuously subject to neutrino heating. The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the center, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface. This heat is partly converted into kinetic energy, and the material accelerates to an outflow that is known as the neutrino-driven wind. For the first time we simulate the collapse, bounce, explosion, and the neutrino-driven wind phases consistently over more than 20 s. Our numerical model is based on spherically symmetric general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics using spectral three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. In simulations where no explosions are obtained naturally, we model neutrino-driven explosions for low- and \u2026",

            "We explore the implications of the QCD phase transition during the postbounce evolution of core-collapse supernovae. Using the MIT bag model for the description of quark matter, we model phase transitions that occur during the early postbounce evolution. This stage of the evolution can be simulated with general relativistic three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. The phase transition produces a second shock wave that triggers a delayed supernova explosion. If such a phase transition happens in a future galactic supernova, its existence and properties should become observable as a second peak in the neutrino signal that is accompanied by significant changes in the energy of the emitted neutrinos. This second neutrino burst is dominated by the emission of antineutrinos because the electron degeneracy is reduced when the second shock passes through the previously neutronized matter.",
