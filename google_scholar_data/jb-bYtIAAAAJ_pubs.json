            "Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election \u2026",

Motivated by the idea of traditional correlation coefficients of fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy sets, several different types of correlation coefficients for HFLTSs are proposed.

As the uniform consensus is often unachievable in practice, in order to achieve the consensus, the existing method needs to remove the experts with the most different opinions from the decision group. It has two drawbacks: the first is the loss of the valuable judgments and opinions of the removed experts. This is especially harmful in practice where most experts or decision makers often have the biased knowledge in the sense of in-depth expertise in some aspects and naive views in other aspects. The second is demotivating the experts in GDM. To overcome these weaknesses in the existing method, this paper presents an enhanced consensus reaching process \u2026",
