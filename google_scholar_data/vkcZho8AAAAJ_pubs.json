            "A mathematical model of the human eye based on the bioheat transfer equation is developed. The intraocular temperature distribution is calculated using the Galerkin finite element method. A difficulty associated with the development of an accurate model of the human eye is the lack of reliable biological data available on the constants and parameters that are used in the model. These parameters include the thermal conductivities of the ocular tissues, the heat loss from the anterior corneal surface to the surroundings by convection and evaporation, and the convective heat loss from the sclera to the body core. The different values for the parameters reported in the ophthalmic literature are employed in the model, and the sensitivity of the temperature distribution to uncertainties in the parameters is investigated. A set of control parameter values is suggested for the normal human eye. The effect of the ambient \u2026",

Such methods are of particular interest because of the considerable scope for parallelization. We propose a number of enhancements which may improve their performance.

A finite element model of the human eye is employed to calculate the temperature rises experienced by the intraocular media when exposed to infrared radiation. The model is used to calculate transient and steady-state temperature distributions for various exposure times and a range of incident irradiances. The effect of the eye's natural cooling mechanisms on the heating is investigated. Specific absorption rates in the infrared irradiated eye are presented. For a radiation source of 1500 degrees C, absorption of radiant energy by the iris and the lens combined with conduction of heat from the anterior regions is found to be responsible for increases in the lens temperature of 1-2 degrees C, but under extreme exposure conditions \u2026",

In this communication, we report on the design and development of a robust, effective and portable Fortran 95 implementation of the classical Ruge\u2013St\u00fcben AMG, which is available as package HSL _ MI20 within the HSL mathematical software library. The routine can be used as a \u2018black-box\u2019preconditioner, but it also offers the user a range of options and parameters. Proper tuning of these parameters for a particular application can significantly enhance the performance of an AMG-preconditioned Krylov solver. This is illustrated using a number of examples arising in the unstructured finite element discretization of the diffusion \u2026",

            "The past few years have seen a signi cant increase in research into numerical methods for computing selected eigenvalues of large sparse nonsymmetric matrices. This research has begun to lead to the development of high-quality mathematical software. The software includes codes that implement subspace iteration methods, Arnoldi-based algorithms, and nonsymmetric Lanczos methods. The aim of the current study is to evaluate this state-of-the-art software. In this study we consider subspace iteration and Arnoldi codes. We look at the key features of the codes and their ease of use. Then, using a wide range of test problems, we compare the performance of the codes in terms of storage requirements, execution times, accuracy, and reliability. We also consider their suitability for solving large-scale industrial problems. Based on our ndings, we suggest how improved software should be designed.",

            "The rapid emergence of multicore machines has led to the need to design new algorithms that are efficient on these architectures. Here, we consider the solution of sparse symmetric positive-definite linear systems by Cholesky factorization. We were motivated by the successful division of the computation in the dense case into tasks on blocks and use of a task manager to exploit all the parallelism that is available between these tasks, whose dependencies may be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Our sparse algorithm is built on the assembly tree and subdivides the work at each node into tasks on blocks of the Cholesky factor. The dependencies between these tasks may again be represented by a DAG. To limit memory requirements, blocks are updated directly rather than through generated-element matrices. Our algorithm is implemented within a new efficient and portable solver HSL_MA87. It is \u2026",
