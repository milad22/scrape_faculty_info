            "We describe synthesis and applications of nonsupported semiconducting porous structures that can be used as photocatalysts for photodegradation of organic pollutants in aqueous environments. The photocatalysts, T1O2 aerogels, are prepared through the sol-gel method and supercritical point drying. These materials have a porosity of 85%, a BET surface area of 600 m2\/g, and a bulk density of 0.5 g\/cm3. X-ray diffraction show the anatase crystalline phase with a crystallite size of 50 \u00c1. The surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of these materials depend on the preparation conditions. The photoassisted oxidation of salicylic acid on these materials was compared to that obtained with commercial (P-25) T1O2 powder. The aerogel shows a much higher photocatalytic activity.",

            "We report on the application of Raman scattering as a probe to follow the structural evolution of TiO2 aerogels. We have traced the evolution of the 142 and 630 cm-1 Eg anatase peaks as a function of morphology. The results have been analyzed in terms of the q vector relaxation mechanism which predicts a unique relation between particle size and features of the Raman spectra. Since the phonon dispersion of anatase is not known, we have used the analogous rutile dispersion. There is good agreement between the particle sizes evaluated from the model and those determined by X-ray diffraction. Our results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be an effective tool in monitoring the evolution of these aerogel systems. ",

The most important properties of the semiconductor are shown to be the band-gap energyE  g , and the flat-band potentialU  fb . The semiconductor absorbs photons that are more energetic than the band-gap energy and creates electronhole pairs. These charge carriers can be separated before recombination by the electric field at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. For electrolysis to proceed, the potential corresponding to the band gap must appreciably exceed the standard potential for the electrolysis of water, 1.23 volts. In addition, the flat-band potential must be more negative than the hydrogen potential or an external bias voltage is required. The \u2026",

The Mott\u2010Schottky plots used for evaluation of the flatband potential were linear over a potential range that exceeds 70% of the bandgap. It has been shown that when the doping distribution is homogeneous, the presence of surface states can be responsible for nonlinear Mott\u2010Schottky plots.

Anodic of the open\u2010circuit potential, both carrier types stop etching, owing to passivation of the surface.

Two types of porous silicon are formed underneath an etch crater: a layer of nanoporous material with pores in the nanometer range on top of a macroporous layer with pores in the micron range. The form of the macropores changes with the crystallographic orientation. We report on the evolution of these different features with the quantity of charge passed during the PEC and other etching parameters.",

The computer simulation is done as a function of\" concentration\" of the particles and the sticking coefficient to the surface. These parameters are correlated with electrochemical parameters such as overpotential, limiting current, exchange current, and electrolyte concentration. The correlations between the two sets of parameters permits direct comparison between simulation and experiment. The transition between\" mossy\" deposits and fully developed dendritic growth is recorded. The simulation reproduces the presence of a critical overpotential and an initiation time. The fundamental interdependence of these parameters and their dependence on the concentration of the electrolyte, quantitatively resemble that of the observed dendrite growth in electrodeposition of Zn \u2026",

The equivalent circuit was interpreted in terms of two space charge layers with two different doping levels. The effect of surface treatment on the relative areas and on the lateral distribution of the two regions is also presented.",
