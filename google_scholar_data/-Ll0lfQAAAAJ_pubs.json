            "A new mode of IR detection using photoemission from a single quantum well is proposed and optimization of the device performance by the proper choice of parameters is discussed. Despite the very thin device structures, theoretical calculations show large absorption at wavelengths near cutoff. The largest photoemissive response is found by adjusting the well parameters so that an excited virtual state lies just above threshold.",

Noise equivalent temperature difference of the camera in the 1-5 THz frequency range was estimated to be at least 3 K, confirming the need for external THz illumination when imaging in this frequency regime. Despite the appearance of fringe patterns produced by multiple diffraction effects, single-frame and extended video imaging of obscured objects show high-contrast differentiation between metallic and plastic materials, supporting the viability of this imaging approach for use in future security screening applications.",

The position of the peak in the photoresponse is in good agreement with that observed in the absorption measurement using a waveguide geometry. A peak responsivity of about 0.3 A\/W and detectivity of D*=1\u00d7109 cm \u221aHz\/W at 77 K are achieved.

The device utilizes the intersubband absorption and the large change of separation between energy levels in the step quantum well under an applied electric field. The incident infrared beam on the device is either absorbed or transmitted depending on the energy separation of the levels, and thus the modulation can be achieved by adjusting the energy levels with an applied electric field. The extremely short lifetime of the intersubband transition makes this modulator suitable for application in high-speed long-wavelength optical communications.< >",
