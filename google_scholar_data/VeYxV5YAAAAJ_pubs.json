Yet this remains challenging in electron matter 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, especially superconductors 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The grand question of what is hidden underneath superconductivity (SC) 15 appears universal, but poorly understood. Here we reveal a long-lived gapless quantum phase of prethermalized quasiparticles (QPs) after a single-cycle terahertz (THz) quench of a Nb 3 Sn SC gap. Its conductivity spectra is characterized by a sharp coherent peak and a vanishing scattering rate that decreases almost linearly towards zero frequency, which is most pronounced around the full depletion of the condensate and absent for a high-frequency pump. Above a critical pump threshold, such a QP phase with coherent transport and memory persists as an unusual prethermalization plateau \u2026",

However, controlled spatial\u2013temporal modulation of the complex order parameter characterizing such non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states remains elusive. Such ultrafast phase-amplitude modulation can manifest via high harmonic modes beyond those allowed by equilibrium symmetries. Here, we drive moving condensate states via subcycle dynamical symmetry breaking achieved with nonlinear oscillating terahertz photocurrents. These non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states with broken inversion symmetry are controlled via Cooper pair acceleration by asymmetric and multi-cycle terahertz photoexcitations.

The unique, transient electronic state is characterized by frequency-dependent carrier relaxations that directly distinguish the faster surface channel than the bulk with no complication from interband excitations or need for reduced bulk doping.

This demonstrates wavelength-selective nonthermal control of conductivity distinct from sample heating.

The THz second harmonic emission vanishes above the superconductor critical temperature and arises from precession of twisted Anderson pseudospins at a multicycle, THz driving frequency that is not allowed by equilibrium symmetry. We explain the microscopic physics by a dynamical symmetry breaking principle at sub-THz-cycle by using quantum kinetic modeling of the interplay between strong THz-lightwave nonlinearity and pulse propagation. The resulting nonzero integrated pulse area inside the superconductor leads to light-induced nonlinear supercurrents due to subcycle Cooper pair acceleration, in contrast to dc-biased superconductors, which can be controlled by the band structure and THz driving field below the superconducting gap.",

Above a critical THz-pump field threshold, there emerges a long-lived metastable phase, approximately 100 ps, with unique Raman phonon-assisted topological switching dynamics absent for optical pumping. The switching also manifests itself by distinct features: nonthermal spectral shape, relaxation slowing near the Lifshitz transition where the critical Dirac point occurs, and diminishing signals at the same temperature that the Berry-curvature-induced anomalous Hall effect \u2026",

While the discovery of morphotropic-like phases in multiferroic BiFeO3 films has broadened this definition, accessing these phase spaces is still typically accomplished through isovalent substitution or heteroepitaxial strain which do not allow for continuous modification of phase composition postsynthesis. Here, we show that it is possible to use low-energy helium implantation to tailor morphotropic phases of epitaxial BiFeO3 films postsynthesis in a continuous and iterative manner. Applying this strain doping approach to morphotropic films creates a new phase space based on internal and external lattice stress that can be seen as an analogue to temperature\u2013composition phase diagrams of classical morphotropic ferroelectric \u2026",

These processes, conveniently expressed as longitudinal T 1 and transverse T 2 relaxation times in the standard pseudospin language for superconductors, cause the gap amplitude to be suppressed after the pulse is turned off, but before the timescale where thermalization occurs due to coupling to the lattice.
