            "This letter presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production using up to 36.1 fb\u2212 1 of proton\u2013proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy s= 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the b b\u00af b b\u00af, b b\u00af W+ W\u2212, b b\u00af \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, W+ W\u2212 W+ W\u2212, b b\u00af \u03b3 \u03b3 and W+ W\u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. No statistically significant excess in data above the Standard Model predictions is found. The combined observed (expected) limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 (10) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (\u03ba \u03bb) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level in \u2026",

The distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of the Standard Model background. In addition to an inclusive dijet search, events with jets identified as containing b-hadrons are examined specifically. No significant excess of events above the smoothly falling background spectra is observed. The results are used to set cross-section upper limits at 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Model-independent limits on Gaussian-shaped signals are also reported. The analysis looking at jets containing b-hadrons benefits from improvements in the jet flavour \u2026",

ATLAS has over 100 million electronic channels, which provide read-out for multiple, distinct detector subsystems, each featuring dedicated technologies to serve a specific purpose. During data-taking it is important that data are available from all detector subsystems, and that they are free from integrity issues.

The searches use 139 fb\u2212 1 of s= 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Events with missing transverse momentum and two same-flavor, oppositely charged, low-transverse-momentum leptons are selected, and are further categorized by the presence of hadronic activity from initial-state radiation or a topology compatible with vector-boson fusion processes. The data are found to be consistent with predictions from the Standard Model. The results are interpreted using simplified models of R-parity-conserving supersymmetry in which the lightest supersymmetric partner is a neutralino with a mass similar to the lightest chargino, the second-to-lightest neutralino, or the slepton.

            "\u00a9 2020, The Author (s). A search for Higgs boson pair production via vector-boson fusion (VBF) in the bb bb final state is carried out with the ATLAS experiment using 126 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collision data delivered at s= 13 TeV by the Large Hadron Collider. This search is sensitive to VBF production of additional heavy bosons that may decay into Higgs boson pairs, and in a non-resonant topology it can constrain the quartic coupling between the Higgs bosons and vector bosons. No significant excess relative to the Standard Model expectation is observed, and limits on the production cross-section are set at the 95% confidence level for a heavy scalar resonance in the context of an extended Higgs sector, and for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Interpretation in terms of the coupling between a Higgs boson pair and two vector bosons is also provided: coupling values normalised to the Standard Model expectation of \u03ba2V<\u2212 0.76 and \u03ba2V> 2.90 are excluded at the 95% confidence level in data.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

The signal selection requires a pair of b-tagged jets consistent with those from a Higgs boson decay, and either an electron or a muon from the W boson decay, together with missing transverse momentum from the corresponding neutrino and the stable neutralinos. The analysis is based on data corresponding to 139 of TeV pp collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector.
