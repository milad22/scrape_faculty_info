We retrieved data on TERT C228T and C250T promoter mutations in 196 HCCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We measured these TERT mutations in plasma cfDNA in 218 patients with HCC and 81 patients with cirrhosis without imaging evidence of HCC. The prevalence of TERT mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas HCC specimens was 44.4%. TERT mutations were detected with similar prevalence (47.7%) in plasma cfDNAs from 218 patients with HCC.

We aimed at determining the prevalence and associated risk factors of cirrhosis in this population. Clinical and demographic variables were extracted for 2466 participants in the community-based Cameron County Hispanic Cohort in South Texas. Aspartate transaminase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) was used to predict cirrhosis in Cameron County Hispanic Cohort. The prevalence of cirrhosis using APRI\u22652 was 0.94%, which is nearly 4-fold higher than the national prevalence. Using APRI\u22651, the overall prevalence of cirrhosis\/advanced fibrosis was 3.54%. In both analyses, highest prevalence was observed in males, specifically in the 25\u201334 age group. Risk factors independently associated with APRI\u22652 and APRI\u22651 included hepatitis C, diabetes and central obesity with a remarkable population attributable fraction of 52.5% and 65.3% from central obesity, respectively. Excess alcohol consumption was also independently associated with APRI\u22652. The presence of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing-3 gene variants was independently associated with APRI\u22651 in participants >50 years old. Males with both central obesity and excess alcohol consumption presented with cirrhosis\/advanced fibrosis at a young age. Alarmingly high prevalence of cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis was identified in Hispanics in South Texas, affecting young males in particular. Central obesity was identified as the major risk factor.

However, trabecular bone score (TBS) is also affected by demographic patterns and body size, and is expected to be different in people from various ethnic or racial backgrounds. Therefore, it is important to understand associations between T2D and TBS for each ethnic or racial group separately.

Current understanding about changes in bone turnover markers in T2D patients is mainly based on studies focused on Caucasian men and women. However, Hispanic populations have the highest prevalence of both T2D and osteoporosis in the US. We investigated associations of glycemic control (in terms of glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) and bone turnover rate in 69 older (\u226550 years) Mexican American Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) participants with T2D. Multivariable analyses were conducted to assess the associations between HbA1c (%), serum osteocalcin (OC), and serum sclerostin. In agreement with published reports from other racial\/ethnic populations, our study found that lower bone turnover (indicated by lower serum OC) occurred in Mexican American men with T2D who had poorer glycemic control. For the women in our study, we found no significant association between glycemic control and OC. In contrast, HbA1c was positively associated with sclerostin for women, with near significance (), while no association was found in men.
