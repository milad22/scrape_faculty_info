The integrals \u0393 p=\u222b 0 1 g 1 p (x, Q 2) d x and \u0393 d=\u222b 0 1 g 1 d (x, Q 2) d x were evaluated at fixed Q 2= 3 (GeV\/c) 2 using the full data set to yield \u0393 p= 0.132\u00b10.003 (stat)\u00b10.009 (syst) and \u0393 d= 0.047\u00b10.003\u00b10.006. The Q 2 dependence of the ratio g 1\/F 1 was studied and found to be small for Q 2> 1 (GeV\/c) 2. Within experimental precision the g 2 data are well described by the twist-2 contribution, g 2 WW. Twist-3 matrix elements were extracted and compared to theoretical predictions. The asymmetry A 2 was measured and found to be significantly smaller than the positivity limit R for both proton and deuteron targets. A 2 p is found to be positive and inconsistent with zero. Measurements of g 1 in the resonance region show \u2026",

The measurements were made at 28 distinct kinematic settings covering a range in momentum transfer of 0.4< Q 2< 5.5 (GeV\u2215 c) 2. These measurements represent a significant contribution to the world\u2019s cross section data set in the Q 2 range, where a large discrepancy currently exists between the ratio of electric to magnetic proton form factors extracted from previous cross section measurements and that recently measured via polarization transfer in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. This data set shows good agreement with previous cross section measurements, indicating that if a heretofore unknown systematic error does exist in the cross section measurements, then it is intrinsic to all such measurements.",

In this Letter, we report new measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio using the recoil polarization method, at momentum transfers Q 2= 5.2, 6.7, and 8.5 GeV 2. By extending the range of Q 2 for which G E p is accurately determined by more than 50%, these measurements will provide significant constraints on models of nucleon structure in the nonperturbative regime.",

For exam ple, they have been widely used in the fields of solid-state and atomic physics-with particular emphasis on electron-atom scattering and neu tron scattering from liquids. Here the structure of the constituents is quite well understood and so the details of scaling, or deviation from scaling, present useful perspectives about the reaction mechanism and the dynamics of the interacting system. In the last twenty years, both theor etical and experimental work in studying scaling phenomena have been extended to higher energy and momentum transfer, a regime where nuclei and nucleons are the many-body systems under investigation. In this area it is not only information about the dynamics that is being sought, but also the nature and underlying structure of the bound \u2026",
