            "When sufficient electrical power P is dissipated in a thin metal film at millikelvin temperatures, the electrons can be driven far out of thermal equilibrium with the phonons. For uniform power dissipation in a volume \u03a9 we show that the electrons attain a steady-state temperature T e=(P\/\u03a3\u03a9+ T p 5) 1\/5, where T p is the phonon temperature and \u03a3 is a parameter involving the electron-phonon coupling. We have used a sensitive ammeter based on a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to measure the Nyquist current noise in thin films of AuCu as a function of P, and thus inferred T e. We fitted our data to the theory with the single parameter \u03a3, and found good agreement for \u03a3=(2.4\u00b10.6)\u00d7 10 9 Wm\u2212 3 K\u2212 5. When we increased the volume of the resistor by attaching a thin-film cooling fin, there was a much smaller increase in T e for a given power dissipation in the resistor, in qualitative agreement with a \u2026",

The individual junction bias currents are used to control the interaction between the qubits by tuning the energy level spacings of the junctions in and out of resonance with each other. Microwave spectroscopy in the 4 to 6 gigahertzrange at 20 millikelvin reveals energy levels that agree well with theoretical results for entangled states. The single qubits are spatially separate, and the entangled states extend over the 0.7-millimeter distance between the two qubits.",

Here, using thin-film composition spreads, we have mapped the functional phase diagram of the Ni\u2013Mn\u2013Ga system whose Heusler composition Ni 2 MnGa is a well known ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy. A characterization technique that allows detection of martensitic transitions by visual inspection was combined with quantitative magnetization mapping using scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy. We find that a large, previously unexplored region outside the Heusler composition contains reversible martensites that are also ferromagnetic. A clear relationship between magnetization and the martensitic transition temperature is observed, revealing a strong thermodynamical coupling \u2026",
