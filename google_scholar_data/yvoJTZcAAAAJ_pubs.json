            "The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) borate crystals for generation of visible and UV light is reviewed. We first discussed on the basic principles of laser frequency conversion. Then, we examine the trends in research on NLO crystals. The background and present status of NLO borate crystals are summarized. The main considerations are focused on the discussion of crystals like CsLiB6O10 (CLBO), GdxY1\u2212xCa4O(BO3)3 (GdYCOB) and K2Al2B2O7 (KAB). Properties of related materials like \u03b2-BaB2O2 (BBO), LiB3O5 (LBO), KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), Sr2Be2BO7 (SBBO), CsB3O5 (CBO), GdCa4O(BO3)3 (GdCOB) and YCa4O(BO3)3 (YCOB) are included for comparison. We aim to provide a complete view of developing a new NLO borate material for actual laser applications. This review covers various aspects including the search for new materials, the growth of bulk crystals, the characterization of crystal \u2026",
