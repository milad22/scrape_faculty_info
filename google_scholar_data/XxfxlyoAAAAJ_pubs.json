            "Fly ash (FA) has been widely used to improve concrete sustainability for many years; however, the amount of FA has been limited by the relatively low cement contents in concrete. In this study, massive volume fly-ash concrete was developed that maximizes the use of FA in concrete through its use as both a cement and aggregate replacement. Concrete containing as much as 728 kg of FA per cubic meter was produced with a compressive strength greater than 30 MPa, a low permeability measured in terms of chloride ion permeability (2300C at 56 d) and electrical resistivity (60 \u03a9-m at 56 d), and a decreased environmental impact.",

            "Large-scale impacts from natural disasters suffered by society encourage researchers and public agencies to develop methods to evaluate, mitigate, respond, and recover from these events. A key aspect for the calculation of the potential earthquake losses is to properly describe the characteristics and value of assets exposed to seismic hazard. This article describes a methodology to develop an exposure model at a census-block resolution for residential structures in Chile using statistical data. The methodology is based on three steps: (1) obtaining dwelling count, construction material and location from census data, (2) defining classification rules for dwellings associated with houses and apartment buildings, and (3) assigning structural typologies and replacement cost. The resulting exposure model consists of a database with the number of residential structures classified into 18 structural typologies at \u2026",

The article is not an exhaustive recollection of all of the processes and methodologies used; it rather points out some of the critical processes that took place with special emphasis in the earthquake characterization and building data. Although there are strong similarities in all of the different data recollection processes after the earthquake, the evidence shows that a rather disaggregate approach was used by the different stakeholders. Moreover, no common standards were implemented or used, and the resulting granularity and accuracy of the data was not comparable even for similar structures, which sometimes led to inadequate decisions.

            "Rural roads may be defined as low-volume roads that provide access and mobility to rural populations. In developing countries they commonly represent 80% of the total road network length and play a key role in economic and social development. Rural roads are divided into unsealed (gravel and earth) and sealed roads (roads with thin bituminous surfaces and stabilized roads). Network management methods recommend the use of objective condition evaluations, such as the pavement condition index and the unpaved roads condition indicator, to assist in decision making. However, none of these indicators properly apply to sealed rural roads; the performance of these roads is different because of climate and traffic demands. The lack of an objective indicator specially calibrated for sealed rural roads was addressed in this study. The main goal was to calibrate a condition indicator for managing sealed rural road \u2026",

A first team focused on the seismic performance and effects of the tsunami on public hospitals and on reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. A second team focused on the road network infrastructure. Field work included: (i) a survey on the physical and functional damages of the public hospitals in the Region; (ii) a visual inspection and preliminary damage assessment of 20 RC buildings in the largest cities of the region and an aftershock instrumentation of the Coquimbo hospital; and (iii) the inspection of bridges, pedestrian bridges, and rockfall along overstepped cut slopes of the road network. The overall limited impact of this megathrust earthquake may be explained in part by the long-term efforts made by the country to prepare for such events. Learnings from the 2010 Maule earthquake were evidenced in the successful evacuation along the coast of the country, and the overall good performance of engineered masonry structures, and of RC buildings designed after 2010.",

            "In a post-disaster environment, hospitals play a critical role in healthcare services continuities to the population while effectively coping with eventual losses of functionality. These losses come from physical damage to the facility, loss of utility lifelines, failure in supply chains, and reduction of personnel. However, data describing the detailed performance of hospitals during past earthquakes are scarce. Consequently, following the 2015 Mw 8.3 Illapel earthquake in central Chile, an exhaustive field campaign was carried out in the Coquimbo region to collect substantial perishable data to describe physical damage to hospitals and functionality losses. This study presents first the baseline information obtained in nine surveyed government hospitals, including size, location and type of infrastructure. Then, the seismic impact was analyzed and classified to show the main physical structural and non-structural damage, lifeline interruptions, losses in hospital units, and variations in flow of patients and staff. Transfers, discharges and evacuations of patients that occurred after the event were also reported. We found that the earthquake did not affect strongly the healthcare service despite the fact that most of the structural and non-structural damage was localized in the largest regional hospital. The archival nature of the data collected may deepen our understanding of the post-earthquake healthcare system performance, which is very useful in improving disaster preparation and overall resilience.",

DNA analyses of the histologic samples showed a euploid pattern in benign and intermediate types of metaplasia, while well\u2010differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma showed a hyperdiploid pattern.

            "With an annual average expense of more than $2,800 million USD, Chile leads the OECD countries with the largest percentage of the GDP spent in disaster losses per year (almost 1.2% GDP). This was the motivation of the Chilean President in 2015 to ask a group of experts to prepare a national Research, Development, and Innovation (R&D+i) strategy for disaster resilience. The strategy was developed by a group, called by the acronym CREDEN, and involved more than 80 experts representing different national stakeholders from the academia, public and private sectors, NGOs, and the armed forces. The work of CREDEN finished December 2016 and produced an R&D+i roadmap composed of five enabling conditions and 14 tasks. The implementation of this strategy demands a total investment of $914 million USD in 20 years, which is expected to have a benefit-cost ratio of 2.32, and annual savings of about $106 million USD. The first stage in this process is the design of a National Institute of R&D+i for Disaster Resilience (ITReND), which will oversee the implementation of the strategy. ITReND\u2019s design was completed in 2017 and its implementation is expected to begin in 2018. This strategy can be considered as an example of how to position R&D+i in the basis of public policy for disaster resilience. Both, the contents of this strategy and its implementation process, have unique aspects and may help guide other disaster-prone countries in their pursuit of larger resilience to the increasing occurrence rate of extreme natural events.",

This article describes the methodology used to obtain an exposure model for residential structures in Chile, and summarizes its results. The exposure model consists in a database with the number of residential structures of each structural typology, and their spatial distribution throughout the country. Three data sources were used: the 2002 and the 2012 Census, and the 2002-2014 Unique Edification Statistic Form. Eighteen structural typologies were defined: ten for masonry, four for reinforced concrete (RC), two for timber, one for adobe, and one for informal constructions. The model showed that 86% of the dwellings are in urban areas and 14% are in rural areas, and that 81% of the dwellings are houses and 19% are located in apartment buildings. The most used materials are masonry (47%), timber (27%), and RC (22%). The model was compared to the PAGER database for Chile, finding agreement on the definition of the main typologies and some differences on dwelling distributions.
