Measurements performed in situ on individual custom-engineered nanotubes inside a high-resolution transmission electron microscope demonstrated the anticipated van der Waals energy\u2013based retraction force and enabled us to place quantitative limits on the static and dynamic interwall frictional forces between nested nanotubes. Repeated extension and retraction of telescoping nanotube segments revealed no wear or fatigue on the atomic scale. Hence, these nanotubes may constitute near perfect, wear-free surfaces.",

The miniaturization of electronic devices over the past century has profoundly affected human communication, computation, manufacturing and transportation systems. True molecular-scale electronic devices are now emerging that set the stage for future integrated nanoelectronics 1. Recently, there have been dramatic parallel advances in the miniaturization of mechanical and electromechanical devices 2.

Based on our observation of the force required to break the tube, a tensile strength of 0.15 TPa was computed. From corresponding bending studies on such nanotubes, the Young's modulus was estimated to be 0.9 TPa (0.8 TPa after \u2018sub continuum\u2019 corrections). These results suggest a strength that is a large fraction of the elastic modulus, although previous measurements of their elastic stiffness have yielded higher modulus values, by as much as a factor of 2. The result does indicate that individual nanotubes can fail as essentially defect-free materials. Furthermore, we observed no obvious reduction in cross-sectional area prior to the failure. In addition, the bending experiments revealed a remarkable flexibility in these tubes. These unique properties support the potential of nanotubes as \u2026",

It is well known that electrochemical insertion of Na+ into graphite is significantly hindered by the insufficient interlayer spacing. Here we report expanded graphite as a Na-ion battery anode. Prepared through a process of oxidation and partial reduction on graphite, expanded graphite has an enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 4.3 \u00c5 yet retains an analogous long-range-ordered layered structure to graphite. In situ transmission electron microscopy has demonstrated that the Na-ion can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from expanded graphite. Galvanostatic studies show that expanded graphite can deliver a high reversible capacity of 284 mAh g\u2212 1 at a current density of 20 mA g\u2212 1, maintain a capacity of 184 mAh g\u2212 1 at 100 mA g\u2212 1, and retain 73.92 \u2026",

Such anisotropic expansion is attributed to the interfacial processes of accommodating large volumetric strains at the lithiation reaction front that depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation. This anisotropic swelling results in lithiated Si nanowires with a remarkable dumbbell-shaped cross section, which develops due to plastic flow and an ensuing necking instability that is induced by the tensile hoop stress buildup in the lithiated shell. The plasticity-driven morphological instabilities often lead to fracture in lithiated nanowires, now captured in video. These results provide important insight into the battery degradation mechanisms.",

            "A simplified arc-method is presented which allows for the continuous synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. In its basic form, the method requires only a dc power supply, a graphite electrode, and a container of liquid nitrogen with no need for pumps, seals, water-cooled vacuum chambers, or purge-gas handling systems. High-quality nanotubes are produced in high yield. The system is easily adaptable to produce large quantities of nanotubes continuously without interruptions for electrode replacement, chamber cleaning, or gas purging.",
