It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to theoretical and empirical studies of both the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxy formation. We present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model, star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the H I ionizing field at z< 3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of re-emitted \u2026",

We demonstrate that the actual situation is more encouraging, using a suite of radiative transfer simulations, post-processed on outputs from a 10243, 94-Mpc N-body simulation. Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale structures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body simulation.

This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of H ii regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: H ii regions grow collectively around highly clustered sources and have a well\u2010defined characteristic size, which evolves from a sub\u2010Mpc scale at the beginning of reionization to   Mpc toward the end.

We have run a set of 190 and 430 comoving Mpc simulations of He II being reionized by quasars to develop an understanding of the nature of He II reionization and its potential impact on observables. We find that He II reionization heats regions in the IGM by as much as 25, 000 K above the temperature that is expected otherwise, with the volume-averaged temperature increasing by~ 12, 000 K and with large temperature fluctuations on~ 50 Mpc scales. Much of this heating occurs far from quasars by photons with long mean free path. We find a temperature-density equation of state of \u03b3\u20131\u2248 0.3 during He II reionization, but with a wide dispersion in this relation having \u03c3 T~ 10 4 K.

            "We forecast the sensitivity with which the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can measure the 21 cm power spectrum of cosmic hydrogen. The MWA is sensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of  \u20131 h Mpc\u22121). This amounts primarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift evolution in these quantities can yield important information about reionization. We examine a range of theoretical models, spanning uncertainties in the nature of the ionizing sources and the abundance of minihalos during reionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially among these models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales (  h Mpc\u22121) peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM) is \u224850% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power \u2026",

            "The epoch of reionization is a milestone of cosmological structure formation, marking the birth of the first objects massive enough to yield large numbers of ionizing photons. However, the mechanism and timescale of reionization remain largely unknown. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) Doppler effect from ionizing bubbles embedded in large-scale velocity streams\u2014known as the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect\u2014can be used to constrain the duration of reionization. When combined with large-scale CMB polarization measurements, the evolution of the ionized fraction, , can be inferred. Using new multi-frequency data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT), we show that the ionized fraction evolved relatively rapidly. For our basic foreground model, we find the kSZ power sourced by reionization at \u2113= 3000 to be D patchy 3000\u2264 2.1 \u03bcK 2 at 95% confidence. Using reionization \u2026",
