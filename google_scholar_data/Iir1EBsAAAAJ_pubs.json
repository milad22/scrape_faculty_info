In most of the complex machine learning problems, the main challenge lies in finding good features. Sparse autoencoders have the ability to learn good features from the input data in an unsuperivised fashion. Sparse auto-encoders and other deep architectures are already showing very good results in text classification, speaker and speech recognition and face recognition as well. In this paper, we compare the performance of sparse autoencoders with soft max regression, fast classifier based on Mahalanobis distance and SVM in fault diagnosis of air compressors.",

Two different strategies have been adopted to deal with the input and the output delays. In the first strategy, the system output delay has been compensated by predicting the dynamics of the signals. In the second strategy, a wide-area controller, based on delay-range-dependent stability criteria, has been designed for the time-varying delays in the input signals. The network induced delays and the maximum amount of the consecutive packet dropout are assumed to be bounded. The controller parameters are optimally obtained using a trace minimization of certain matrix variables by formulating Linear Matrix Inequalities problem. The system has been identified by \u2026",

Traditional classification approaches deal poorly on content based image classification tasks being one of the reasons of high dimensionality of the feature space. In this paper, color image classification is done on features extracted from histograms of color components. The benefit of using color image histograms are better efficiency, and insensitivity to small changes in camera view-point i.e. translation and rotation. As a case study for validation purpose, experimental trials were done on a database of about 500 images divided into four different classes has been reported and compared on histogram features for RGB, CMYK, Lab, YUV, YCBCR, HSV, HVC and YIQ color spaces. Results based on the proposed approach are found encouraging in terms of color image classification accuracy.",

In the first step, the pixels are categorized as good or bad based on their primary membership function (MF) values in the respective filter window. In this paper, two approaches have been proposed for finding threshold between good or bad pixels by designing primary MFs. a) MFs with distinct Means and same Variance and b) MFs with distinct Means and distinct Variances. The primary MFs of the Type-2 fuzzy set is chosen as Gaussian membership functions. Whereas, in the second step, the pixels categorized as bad are denoised. For denoising, a novel Type-1 fuzzy approach based on a weighted mean of good pixels is presented in the paper.

Recently, deep learning techniques have shown new ways of obtaining useful feature representation that provide state of the art results in image and speech processing applications.
