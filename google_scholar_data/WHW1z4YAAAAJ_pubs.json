We take two forms of the energy-momentum tensor of dark components and demonstrate that equilibrium description of thermodynamics is not achievable in both cases. We check the validity of the first and second law of thermodynamics in this scenario. It is shown that the Friedmann equations can be expressed in the form of first law of thermodynamics T h dS'h+ T h d bold jmath S'=\u2212 dE'+ W'dV, where d bold jmath S'is the entropy production term. Finally, we conclude that the second law of thermodynamics holds both in phantom and non-phantom phases.",
