            "When a spilled drop of coffee dries on a solid surface, it leaves a dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The coffee\u2014initially dispersed over the entire drop\u2014becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time\u2014a law independent of the particular \u2026",

            "Solids dispersed in a drying drop will migrate to the edge of the drop and form a solid ring. This phenomenon produces ringlike stains and occurs for a wide range of surfaces, solvents, and solutes. Here we show that the migration is caused by an outward flow within the drop that is driven by the loss of solvent by evaporation and geometrical constraint that the drop maintain an equilibrium droplet shape with a fixed boundary. We describe a theory that predicts the flow velocity, the rate of growth of the ring, and the distribution of solute within the drop. These predictions are compared with our experimental results.",

            "One of the main goals of polymer sciencehas been to relate the structure of macromolecular chains to their macroscopic properties. In particular, it has been hoped that one could relate the sizes of polymer coils to the degree to which they entangle with one another and thus to their viscoelasticity in the melt. In recent years, the availability of model polymers with nearly monodisperse molecular weight distributions and precisely controlled chemical structures has allowed for improved data both on rheology and on the dimensions of the chains. This has now allowed us to determine the correlations between such properties as chain dimensions, density, and plateau modulus and to show that some quite simple relations exist between them. The main body of these data is on polymers that can be considered to be models for polyolefins. These have been madeby the hydrogenation of polydienes synthesized by anionic \u2026",

            "We study theoretically the complex network of forces that is responsible for the static structure and properties of granular materials. We present detailed calculations for a model in which the fluctuations in the force distribution arise because of variations in the contact angles and the constraints imposed by the force balance on each bead of the pile. We compare our results for the force distribution function for this model, including exact results for certain contact angle probability distributions, with numerical simulations of force distributions in random sphere packings. This model reproduces many aspects of the force distribution observed both in experiment and in numerical simulations of sphere packings. Our model is closely related to some that have been studied in the context of self-organized criticality. We present evidence that in the force distribution context,\" critical\" power-law force distributions occur only when \u2026",

We use a self-consistent field method, valid in the limit of weak excluded volume and at moderately high surface coverage. Exploiting the fact that the chains are highly stretched, we map the problem (in the long-chain limit) onto one involving the motion of classical particles in an equal-time potential, which we can solve exactly. The resulting density profile for the brush takes a parabolic form.",

We show that such a feature is a necessary consequence of the weak connectivity of the solid, and that the frequency of modes in excess is very sensitive to the pressure. We analyze, in particular, two systems whose density D (\u03c9) of vibrational modes of angular frequency \u03c9 display scaling behaviors with the packing fraction:(i) simulations of jammed packings of particles interacting through finite-range, purely repulsive potentials, comprised of weakly compressed spheres at zero temperature and (ii) a system with the same network of contacts, but where the force between any particles in contact (and therefore the total pressure) is set to zero. We account in the two cases for the observed (a) convergence of D (\u03c9) toward a nonzero constant as \u03c9\u2192 0,(b) appearance of a low-frequency cutoff \u03c9*, and (c) power \u2026",
