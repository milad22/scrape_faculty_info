            "If dark matter interacts with quarks or gluons, the mediator of these interactions is either directly accessible at the LHC or is so heavy that its effects are encoded in contact operators. We find that the self-consistency of a contact operator description at the LHC implies bounds on the mediator scale stronger than those found from missing energy searches. This translates into spin-independent elastic scattering cross sections at a level\u2272 10\u2212 41 cm 2, with direct implications for the DAMA, CoGeNT, and CRESST-II anomalies. We then carefully explore the potential of monojet searches in the light mediator limit, focusing on a Z\u2032 model with arbitrary couplings to quarks and dark matter. We find that Tevatron data currently provide the most stringent bounds for dark matter and Z\u2032 masses below 100 GeV, and that these searches can constrain models for the DAMA, CoGeNT, and CRESST-II anomalies only if the mediator \u2026",

By exploring the consequences of a primordial asymmetry on the coupled dark matter and anti-dark matter Boltzmann equations we find large regions of parameter space that interpolate between these two extremes. Interestingly, this new asymmetric WIMP framework can accommodate a wide range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross sections. The present-day dark matter population is typically asymmetric, but only weakly so, such that indirect signals of dark matter annihilation are not completely suppressed. We apply our results to existing models, noting that upcoming direct detection experiments will constrain a large region of the relevant parameter space.",

We use the CERN SPS 190 GeV\/c \u03c0\u2212 beam and a transversely polarized ammonia target. Three azimuthal asymmetries giving access to different transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are extracted using dimuon events with invariant mass between 4.3 GeV\/c 2 and 8.5 GeV\/c 2. Within the experimental uncertainties, the observed sign of the Sivers asymmetry is found to be consistent with the fundamental prediction of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that the Sivers TMD PDFs extracted from DY have a sign opposite to the one extracted from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data.

These design choices will enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that will help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 1 contains an executive summary that describes the general aims of this document. The remainder of this first volume provides a more detailed description of the DUNE physics program that drives the choice of detector technologies. It also includes concise outlines of two overarching systems that have not yet evolved to consortium structures: computing and calibration. Volumes 2 and 3 of this IDR describe, for the single-phase and dual-phase technologies, respectively, each detector module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its design, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure.",

We point out that these events also probe extensions of the Standard Model modifying neutrino\u2013quark interactions. Such nonstandard interactions (NSI) have been discussed in connection with neutrino oscillation experiments. Assuming first that NSI remain contact at LHC energies, we derive stringent bounds that approach the levels suggested by the B 8 solar data. We next explore the possibility that the mediators of the NSI can be produced at colliders. The constraints are found to be strongest for mediator masses in the 10 2\u201310 3 GeV range, with the best bounds above\u223c 200 GeV coming from ATLAS and below from CDF. For mediators with masses below 30 GeV the monojet bounds are weaker than in the contact limit. These results also directly apply to light dark matter searches.

To test such possibilities, we consider the fate of a wind powered by an active minidisk in a relatively short, super-Eddington accretion episode onto a BH with~ 10\u2013100 solar masses.
