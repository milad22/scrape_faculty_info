            "Amber is the collective name for a suite of programs that allow users to carry out molecular dynamics simulations, particularly on biomolecules. None of the individual programs carries this name, but the various parts work reasonably well together, and provide a powerful framework for many common calculations.[3, 4] The term amber is also sometimes used to refer to the empirical force fields that are implemented here.[5, 6] It should be recognized however, that the code and force field are separate: several other computer packages have implemented the amber force fields, and other force fields can be implemented with the amber programs. Further, the force fields are in the public domain, whereas the codes are distributed under a license agreement.The Amber software suite is now divided into two parts: AmberTools, a collection of freely available programs mostly under the GPL license, and Amber10, which is centered around the sander and pmemd simulation programs, and which continues to be licensed as before, under a more restrictive license. You need to install both parts, starting with AmberTools. Amber 10 (2008) represents a significant change from the most recent previous version, Amber 9, which was released in March, 2006. Briefly, the major differences include:",

            "The recent dramatic rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has triggered intense research worldwide. However, high PCE values have often been reached with poor stability at an illuminated area of typically less than 0.1 square centimeter. We used heavily doped inorganic charge extraction layers in planar PSCs to achieve very rapid carrier extraction, even with 10- to 20-nanometer-thick layers, avoiding pinholes and eliminating local structural defects over large areas. The robust inorganic nature of the layers allowed for the fabrication of PSCs with an aperture area >1 square centimeter that have a PCE >15%, as certified by an accredited photovoltaic calibration laboratory. Hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics was eliminated; the PSCs were stable, with >90% of the initial PCE remaining after 1000 hours of light soaking.",

This binding is not sufficient for viral entry, which requires fusion between the viral envelope and cell membrane. Here, we show that heparan sulfate modified by a subset of the multiple D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms provides sites for the binding of a third viral glycoprotein, gD, and for initiation of HSV-1 entry. We conclude that susceptibility of cells to HSV-1 entry depends on (1) presence of heparan sulfate chains to which virus can bind and (2) 3-O-sulfation of specific glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate to generate gD-binding sites or the expression of other previously identified gD-binding receptors.",

This study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to diet-induced obesity and diabetes. For example, white adipose tissue (WAT) from obese humans and mice contain more mast cells than WAT from their lean counterparts. Furthermore, in the context of mice on a Western diet, genetically induced deficiency of mast cells, or their pharmacological stabilization, reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases in serum and WAT, in concert with improved glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure.
