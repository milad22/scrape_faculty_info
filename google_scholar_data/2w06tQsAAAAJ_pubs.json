            "The different roles the attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a Lennard\u2010Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair\u2010correlation function) rather than the pair\u2010correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard\u2010Jones fluid.

            "We develop a unified and generally applicable theory of solvation of small and large apolar species in water. In the former, hydrogen bonding of water is hindered yet persists near the solutes. In the latter, hydrogen bonding is depleted, leading to drying of extended apolar surfaces, large forces of attraction, and hysteresis on mesoscopic length scales. The crossover occurs on nanometer length scales, when the local concentration of apolar units is sufficiently high, or when an apolar surface is sufficiently large. Our theory for the crossover has implications concerning the stability of protein assemblies and protein folding. ",

The expansion is ordered by a softness parameter \u03be which is essentially the range of intermolecular distances in which the difference between the Mayer f functions for the repulsive potential and an appropriate reference hard-sphere potential is nonzero. The first (lowest-order) approximation generated by the expansion equates the free energy and y (r) for the fluid to the respective functions appropriate to a system of hard spheres with diameter d.

The total volume V is divided into a square array of columns whose width is the order of the bulk correlation length. The canonical partition function is written as a sum of constrained partition functions, each describing a system with a given number of particles in each column. Changes in the occupation number of each column (i.e., density fluctuations) are related to changes in position of the local Gibbs dividing surface, and the free energy of such distortions of the Gibbs surface is estimated using macroscopic ideas similar to those used in the capillary wave theory by Buff, Lovett, and Stillinger. Corrections to the interface tension as calculated for a single column with periodic boundary conditions are given. We make a self\u2010consistent choice of \u2026",

            "We present a quantitative theory to describe enhancement of defect reaction rates upon electron-hole recombination. The theory is based on the following mechanism: energy liberated upon nonradiative electron or hole capture is converted largely into vibrational energy that is initially localized in the vicinity of the defect. This vibrational energy can be utilized to promote defect reactions such as diffusion. The process can be described using a formulation similar to the successful Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel theory of unimolecular reactions. The resulting expression for the enhanced reaction rate depends upon two physical properties of the defect: the number of effective oscillators of the\" defect molecule\" and the rate of dissipation of local vibrational energy to the lattice. The theory is consistent with recent experiments of Kimerling and Lang and may be useful for understanding several related processes occurring in \u2026",
