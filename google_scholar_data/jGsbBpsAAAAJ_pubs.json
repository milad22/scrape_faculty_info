            "Modeling studies indicate that double\u2010headed streamers originating from single electron avalanches in lightning\u2010driven quasi\u2010static electric fields at mesospheric altitudes accelerate and expand, reaching transverse scales from tens to a few hundreds of meters and propagation speeds up to one tenth of the speed of light, in good agreement with recent telescopic, high\u2010speed video and multichannel photometric observations of sprites. The preionization of the medium ahead of a streamer by the ionizing UV photons originating from a region of high electric field in the streamer head (i.e., photoionization) significantly modifies the streamer scaling properties as a function of air pressure in comparison with those predicted by similarity laws. The photoionization leads to lower peak electric fields in the streamer head, lower streamer electron densities, wider initial streamer structures, and lower acceleration and \u2026",

These streamers at ground pressure, after 1\/N scaling with atmospheric air density N, appear to be fully analogous to those documented using telescopic imagers in transient luminous events (TLEs) termed sprites, which occur in the altitude range 40\u201390 km in the Earth's atmosphere above thunderstorms.

The modelling results emphasize that the quenching of the singlet excited states of molecular nitrogen emitting photoionizing radiation is responsible for non-similar behaviour of streamers at pressures higher than approximately 30 Torr. Our modelling results are consistent with recent experimental work showing that streamers have more and thinner channels and branch more frequently at higher (ie near atmospheric) pressures than at lower pressures. The results also demonstrate the importance of accounting for effects associated with electrode geometry for the interpretation of experimental studies on similarity properties of streamers at various pressures.",

Numerical simulations show that positive streamers are able to form from the tip of an ionization column in a uniform applied electric field well below the breakdown threshold field. However, even when the applied field approaches the breakdown threshold field, negative streamers fail to originate from the other tip of the ionization column after the positive streamer has propagated a certain distance.

            "The time dependent optical emission model developed by Liu and Pasko (2004) is applied to studies of far\u2010UV emissions of sprite streamers due to N2 Lyman\u2010Birge\u2010Hopfield (LBH) band system. Modeling results indicate that the LBH emissions of sprite streamers at 70 km are generally stronger by up to a factor of 10 than those from the first negative band system of N2+, and experimental measurements of the ratio of these two emissions at sprite altitudes can be used to determine poorly known quenching altitude of the N2 (a1\u03a0g) state.",
