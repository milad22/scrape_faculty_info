These electronic parameters can be reversibly \u201ctuned\u201d by surprisingly small concentrations of adsorbed gases, and an apparently semiconducting nanotube can be converted into an apparent metal through such exposure. These results, although demonstrating that nanotubes could find use as sensitive chemical gas sensors, likewise indicate that many supposedly intrinsic properties measured on as-prepared nanotubes may be severely compromised by extrinsic air exposure effects.",

Both large, multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs), with many concentric carbon shells, and bundles or \u201cropes\u201d of aligned single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), are complex composite conductors that incorporate many weakly coupled nanotubes that each have a different electronic structure. Here we demonstrate a simple and reliable method for selectively removing single carbon shells from MWNTs and SWNT ropes to tailor the properties of these composite nanotubes. We can remove shells of MWNTs stepwise and individually characterize the different shells. By choosing among the shells, we can convert a MWNT into either a metallic or a semiconducting conductor, as well as directly address the issue of multiple-shell transport. With SWNT ropes, similar selectivity allows us to generate entire arrays of nanoscale field-effect transistors based solely \u2026",

The first carbon nanotubes that Iijima observed back in 1991 were so-called multiwalled tubes: each contained a number of hollow cylinders of carbon atoms nested inside one another like Russian dolls. Two years later Iijima and Donald Bethune of IBM independently created single-walled nanotubes that were made of just one layer of carbon atoms. Both kinds of tubes are made in similar ways, and they have many similar properties\u2014the most obvious being that they are exceedingly narrow and long.

We assign these steps to the sequential destruction of individual nanotube shells, consistent with the MWNT's concentric-shell geometry. Furthermore, the initiation of this failure is very sensitive to air exposure. In air failure is initiated by oxidation at a particular power, whereas in vacuum MWNTs can withstand much higher power densities and reach their full current carrying capacities.",

At low applied electric fields, the electron field emission current-voltage characteristics qualitatively follow conventional Fowler-Nordheim behavior up to a critical current density. However, the current rise at low applied fields is anomalously steep, suggesting that the Fowler-Nordheim model is not sufficient to quantitatively characterize the emission. In the high-field region, the emission characteristics have a more complex behavior. In that regime, the instantaneous field emission is reminiscent of the low-field behavior, but discrete switching events lead to an overall current suppression.

Although this defect density compares favourably to high-quality, silicon single-crystals, the presence of a single defect can have tremendous electronic effects in one-dimensional conductors such as SWNTs. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between chemically active point defects and sites of local electronic sensitivity in SWNT circuits, confirming the expectation that individual defects may be critical to understanding and controlling variability, noise and chemical \u2026",
