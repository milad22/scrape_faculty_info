The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026",

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma\u2010ray bursts and jet\u2010driven supernovae.",

The observed sky distribution of weak gamma-ray bursts constrains the allowable geometrical models to sources in either a giant spherical galactic halo or to sources at cosmological distances. Observations of time dilation consistent with the latter have been reported. Extensive searches for a counterpart to gamma-ray bursts in other wavelength regions have thus far proved negative. In spite of the abundance of new observations of gamma-ray bursts, their energy source and emission mechanism remain highly speculative. New, rapid counterpart search efforts and several new space-borne experiments may provide the needed observations to make progress in the field",

The Galaxy is relatively transparent to such \u03b3-rays, and emission has been found concentrated along its plane 2. This led to the conclusion 1 that massive stars throughout the Galaxy dominate the production of 26 Al. On the other hand, meteoritic data show evidence for locally produced 26 Al, perhaps from spallation reactions in the protosolar disk 3, 4, 5. Furthermore, prominent \u03b3-ray emission from the Cygnus region suggests that a substantial fraction of Galactic 26 Al could originate in localized star-forming regions. Here we report high spectral resolution measurements of 26 Al emission at 1808.65 keV, which demonstrate that the 26 Al source regions corotate with the Galaxy, supporting its Galaxy-wide origin. We determine a present-day equilibrium mass of 2.8 (\u00b10.8) solar \u2026",

While many models have been proposed, those currently favored are all based upon the formation of and\/or rapid accretion into stellar\u2010mass black holes.

Population synthesis calculations are carried out using a Monte Carlo approach in which the many uncertain parameters intrinsic to such calculations are varied.

            "We report on the detection by Swift of GRB 080913, and subsequent optical\/near-infrared follow-up observations by GROND, which led to the discovery of its optical\/NIR afterglow and the recognition of its high-z nature via the detection of a spectral break between the i'and z'bands. Spectroscopy obtained at the ESO-VLT revealed a continuum extending down to \u03bb= 9400 \u00c5, and zero flux for 7500 \u00c5< \u03bb< 9400 \u00c5, which we interpret as the onset of a Gunn-Peterson trough at z= 6.695\u00b10.025 (95.5% confidence level), making GRB 080913 the highest-redshift gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date, and more distant than the highest-redshift QSO. We note that many redshift indicators that are based on promptly available burst or afterglow properties have failed for GRB 080913. We report on our follow-up campaign and compare the properties of GRB 080913 with bursts at lower redshift. In particular, since the afterglow of this \u2026",

VLT spectra of the afterglow show damped Ly\u03b1\u2000(DLA) absorption and low- and high-ionization lines at a redshift . The inferred neutral hydrogen column density, , is larger than any (GRB- or QSO-) DLA column density inferred directly from Ly\u03b1\u2000in absorption. From the afterglow photometry, we derive a conservative upper limit to the host-galaxy extinction:  mag. The iron abundance is , while the metallicity of the gas as measured from sulphur is . We derive an upper limit on the H2 molecular fraction of . In the Ly\u03b1\u2000trough, a Ly\u03b1\u2000emission line is detected, which corresponds to a star-formation rate (not corrected for dust extinction) of roughly 1 M yr-1. All these results are consistent with the host galaxy of GRB\u2009030323\u2000consisting of a low metallicity gas with a low dust content. We detect fine-structure lines of silicon, *, which have never been \u2026",
