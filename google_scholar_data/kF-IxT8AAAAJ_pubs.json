            "A broad review of the structure and properties of carbon nanotubes is presented. Particular emphasis is given to the singularities in the one-dimensional density of states predicted for single-wall nanotubes of small diameter. The evidence provided by scanning tunneling microscopy and resonant Raman scattering experiments in support of these singularities in the one-dimensional density of states is presented. The remarkable electronic and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are also briefly reviewed and some potential applications for the nanotubes are suggested.",

Numerous Raman peaks were observed and identified with vibrational modes of armchair symmetry (n, n) SWNTs. The Raman spectra are in good agreement with lattice dynamics calculations based on C-C force constants used to fit the two-dimensional, experimental phonon dispersion of a single graphene sheet. Calculated intensities from a nonresonant, bond polarizability model optimized for sp2 carbon are also in qualitative agreement with the Raman data, although a resonant Raman scattering process is also taking place. This resonance results from the one-dimensional quantum confinement of the electrons in the nanotube.",

Chemical doping is expected to substantially increase the density of free charge carriers and thereby enhance the electrical (and thermal) conductivity. Here we use Raman spectroscopy to study the effects of exposing SWNT bundles 1 to typical electron-donor (potassium, rubidium) and electron-acceptor (iodine, bromine) dopants. We find that the high-frequency tangential vibrational modes of the carbon atoms in the SWNTs shift substantially to lower (for K, Rb) or higher (for Br 2) frequencies. Little change is seen for I 2 doping. These shifts provide evidence for charge transfer between the dopants and the nanotubes, indicating an ionic character of the doped samples.

Electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were all used to study the effect of the catalyst on the tube yield, and the evolution of the tube diameter distribution with increasing growth environment temperature T. By controlling the temperature in the range 780< T< 1050 C, we have been able to tune the diameter of the tubules from\u223c 0.81 to\u223c 1.51 nm. The threshold temperature for significant SWNT production was found to be\u223c 850 C.",

            "This Letter outlines a model to account for the catalyzed growth of nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition. It proposes that their formation and growth is an extension of other known processes in which graphitic structures form over metal surfaces at moderate temperatures through the decomposition of organic precursors. Importantly, the model also states that the form of carbon produced depends on the physical dimensions of the catalyzed reactions. Experimental data are presented that correlate nanotube diameters to the size of the catalyst particles. Nanotube stability as a function of nanotube type, length and diameter are also investigated through theoretical calculations.",

            "Full-length single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were rendered soluble in common organic solvents by noncovalent (ionic) functionalization of the carboxylic acid groups present in the purified SWNTs. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the majority of the SWNTs ropes were exfoliated into small ropes (2\u22125 nm in diameter) and individual nanotubes with lengths of several micrometers during the dissolution process. The combination of multiwavelength laser excitation Raman scattering spectroscopy and solution-phase visible and near-infrared spectroscopies was used to characterize the library of SWNTs that is produced in current preparations. The average diameter of metallic nanotubes was found by Raman spectroscopy to be smaller than that of semiconducting nanotubes in the various types of full-length SWNT preparations. This observation sheds new light on the mechanism of SWNT formation. ",
