Two integers label the family of Hopfions we have found. Their product is equal to the Hopf charge which provides a lower bound to the soliton's finite energy. The Hopfions are explicitly constructed in terms of the toroidal coordinates and shown to have a form of linked closed vortices.",

Construction of the action is guided by the requirement that the energy of static configuration should be scale invariant. The solution is constructed exactly.

The relevant integrable cKPr,m structure  is a generalization of the familiar r-reduction of the full KP  hierarchy to the SL(r) generalized KdV hierarchy  cKPr,0. The important feature of  cKPr,m hierarchies is the presence of a discrete  symmetry structure generated by successive Darboux\u2013B\u00e4cklund (DB)  transformations. This symmetry allows for expressing the relevant  tau-functions as Wronskians within a formalism which realizes the  tau-functions as DB orbits of simple initial solutions. In particular,  it is shown that any DB orbit of a cKPr,1 defines  a generalized two-dimensional Toda lattice structure. Furthermore, we  consider the class of truncated KP hierarchies (i.e \u2026",

            "The conventional formulation of additional nonisospectral sysmmetries for the full Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) integrable hierarchy is not compatible with the reduction to the important class of constrained KP (cKP) integrable models. This paper solves explicitly the problem of compatibility of the Virasoro part of additional symmetries with the underlying constraints of cKP hierarchies. Our construction involves an appropriate modification of the standard additional-symmetry flows by adding a set of \u201cghost symmetry\u201d flows. We also discuss the special case of cKP \u2014 truncated KP hierarchies, obtained as Darboux-B\u00e4cklund orbits of initial purely differential Lax operators. Our construction establishes the condition for commutativity of the additional-symmetry flows with the discrete Darboux-B\u00e4cklund transformations of cKP hierarchies leading to a new derivation of the string-equation constraint in matrix models.",

This hierarchy is analyzed using two approaches, namely linear matrix eigenvalue problem on hermitian symmetric space and constrained KP Lax formulation and it is shown that these approaches are equivalent. The model is recognized to be the generalized non\u2010linear Schr\u00f6dinger (GNLS ) hierarchy and it is used as a building block for a new class of constrained KP hierarchies. These constrained KP hierarchies are connected via similarity\u2010B\u00e4cklund transformations and interpolate between GNLS and multi\u2010boson KP\u2010Toda hierarchies. Our construction uncovers the origin of the Toda lattice structure behind the latter hierarchy.",
