The triplet state is formed in near quantitative yield and produces a very high yield of singlet oxygen by energy transfer. does not react with singlet molecular oxygen and quenches it only slowly by an unknown mechanism. These results are discussed in terms of the unusual geometry of this molecule.",

Each of the \u223c20 samples, ranging in effective core diameter from 1.4 to 3.2 nm (\u223c70 to \u223c800 Au atoms), has been purified by fractional crystallization and has undergone a separate compositional and structural characterization by mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction. With decreasing core mass (crystallite size) the spectra uniformly show a systematic evolution, specifically (i) a broadening of the so-called surface-plasmon band until it is essentially unidentifiable for crystallites of less than 2.0 nm effective diameter, (ii) the emergence of a distinct onset for strong absorption near the energy (\u223c1.7 eV) of the interbandgap (5d \u2192 6sp), and (iii) the \u2026",

            "Synthesis, characterization, and functionalization of self-assembled, ligand-stabilized gold nanoparticles are long-standing issues in the chemistry of nanomaterials. Factors driving the thermodynamic stability of well documented discrete sizes are largely unknown. Herein, we provide a unified view of principles that underlie the stability of particles protected by thiolate (SR) or phosphine and halide (PR3, X) ligands. The picture has emerged from analysis of large-scale density functional theory calculations of structurally characterized compounds, namely Au102(SR)44, Au39(PR3)14X6\u2212, Au11(PR3)7X3, and Au13(PR3)10X23+, where X is either a halogen or a thiolate. Attributable to a compact, symmetric core and complete steric protection, each compound has a filled spherical electronic shell and a major energy gap to unoccupied states. Consequently, the exceptional stability is best described by a \u201cnoble-gas \u2026",

The monodisperse gold nanoparticles are stabilized by short-chain alkanethiolate monolayers and have 8 to 38 kilodaltons core mass (1.1 to 1.9 nanometers in diameter). Larger cores display Coulomb staircase responses consistent with double-layer charging of metal-electrolyte interfaces, whereas smaller core nanoparticles exhibit redox chemical character, including a large central gap. The change in behavior is consistent with new near-infrared spectroscopic data showing an emerging gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals of 0.4 to 0.9 electron volt.",

Superconductivity was originally discovered in samples prepared from gas\u2013solid reactions 1, which made it impossible to determine the composition or structure of the superconducting phase. Holczer et al. 4 demonstrated that potassium-doped C 60 has only a single stable superconducting phase, K 3 C 60, with a transition temperature of 19.3 K. Improvements have since resulted in the preparation of 100% bulk superconductors 3. Because of the absence of impurity phases, we have been able to perform accurate Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction data from the superconducting phase. Here we report our results for the crystal structure of K 3 C 60, determining that this superconducting compound has a face-centred cubic \u2026",
