            "Using first principles calculations we showed that the electronic and optical properties of single-layer black phosphorus (BP) depend strongly on the applied strain. Due to the strong anisotropic atomic structure of BP, its electronic conductivity and optical response are sensitive to the magnitude and the orientation of the applied strain. We found that the inclusion of many body effects is essential for the correct description of the electronic properties of monolayer BP; for example, while the electronic gap of strainless BP is found to be 0.90 eV by using semilocal functionals, it becomes 2.31 eV when many-body effects are taken into account within the G 0 W 0 scheme. Applied tensile strain was shown to significantly enhance electron transport along zigzag direction of BP. Furthermore, biaxial strain is able to tune the optical band gap of monolayer BP from 0.38 eV (at\u2212 8% strain) to 2.07 eV (at 5.5%). The exciton binding \u2026",

We found that the considered metal atoms are strongly bound to the Mo2C monolayer. However, the adsorption energies of these alkali and earth alkali elements decrease as the coverage increases due to the enhanced repulsion between the metal ions. We predict a significant charge transfer from the ad-atoms to the Mo2C monolayer, which indicates clearly the cationic state of the metal atoms. The metallic character of both pristine and doped Mo2C ensures a good electronic conduction that is essential for an optimal anode material. Low migration energy barriers are predicted as small as 43 meV for Li, 19 meV for Na and 15 meV for K, which result in the very fast diffusion of these atoms on Mo2C.

Unlike the well-known members of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), ReS 2 crystallizes in a stable distorted-1 T structure and lacks an indirect to direct gap crossover. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the formation, energetics, and stability of the most prominent lattice defects in monolayer ReS 2. Experimentally, irradiation with 3-MeV He+ 2 ions was used to break the strong covalent bonds in ReS 2 flakes. Photoluminescence measurements showed that the luminescence from monolayers is mostly unchanged after highly energetic \u03b1 particle irradiation. In order to understand the energetics of possible vacancies in ReS 2 we performed systematic first-principles calculations. Our calculations revealed that the formation of a \u2026",

While blue phosphorus has isotropic properties, black phosphorus is strongly anisotropic in its electronic and optical properties due to its anisotropic crystal structure. In this work, we systematically investigated the lattice thermal properties of black and blue phosphorene by using first-principles calculations based on the quasiharmonic approximation approach. Similar to the optoelectronic and electronic properties, we predict that black phosphorene has highly anisotropic thermal properties, in contrast to the blue phase. The linear thermal expansion coefficients along the zigzag and armchair direction differ up to 20% in black phosphorene.
