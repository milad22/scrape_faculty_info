            "Mice deficient in the Polycomb repressor Bmi1 develop numerous abnormalities including a severe defect in stem cell self-renewal, alterations in thymocyte maturation and a shortened lifespan. Previous work has implicated de-repression of the Ink4a\/Arf (also known as Cdkn2a) locus as mediating many of the aspects of the Bmi1-\/-phenotype. Here we demonstrate that cells derived from Bmi1-\/-mice also have impaired mitochondrial function, a marked increase in the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and subsequent engagement of the DNA damage response pathway. Furthermore, many of the deficiencies normally observed in Bmi1-\/-mice improve after either pharmacological treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or genetic disruption of the DNA damage response pathway by Chk2 (also known as Chek2) deletion. These results demonstrate that Bmi1 has an unexpected role in maintaining \u2026",

            "Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of acetylcholine, is presently the most specific indicator for monitoring the functional state of cholinergic neurones in the central and peripheral nervous systems. ChAT is a single\u2010strand globular protein. The enzyme is synthesized in the perikaryon of cholinergic neurones and transported to the nerve terminals probably by both slow and rapid axoplasmic flows. ChAT exists in at least two forms in cholinergic nerve terminals: (i) soluble; and (ii) non\u2010ionically membrane\u2010bound forms. Multiple mRNA species of ChAT (R\u2010, N\u2010and M\u2010types) are transcribed from different promoter regions and produced by different splicing in the mouse, rat, and human. All transcripts encode the same ChAT protein in rodents, while in human M\u2010type mRNA has the capability to generate both large and small forms of ChAT proteins and R\u2010and N\u2010types ChAT \u2026",

The formation of RGO was studied using Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Composites were prepared by dispersing 2%, 4% and 10% by weight of the synthesized RGO into nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) matrix. Microwave absorption properties of RGO\/NBR composites were investigated by measuring their complex permittivity and permeability by using waveguide method. Simulation studies show that 10 wt.% of graphene oxide in NBR matrix exhibits high values of reflection loss (>10 dB) over a wide frequency range 7.5\u201312 GHz and maximum loss is 57 dB at 9.6 GHz at a thickness of 3 mm.",

The nanoparticles were stabilized by capping with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). XRD studies show the phase singularity of ZnS particles having zinc-blende (cubic) structure. TEM as well as XRD line broadening indicate that the average crystallite size of undoped samples is \u223c2 nm. The effects of change in stoichiometry and doping with Cu+ and halogen on the photoluminescence properties of ZnS nanophosphors have been investigated. Sulfur vacancy (VS) related emission with peak maximum at 434 nm has been dominant in undoped ZnS nanoparticles. Unlike in the case of microcrystalline ZnS phosphor, incorporation of halogens in nanoparticles did not result VZn related self-activated emission. However, emission characteristics of nanophosphors have been changed with Cu \u2026",

            "A single step method was developed for the preparation of graphene oxide\/Fe2O3 composites by exfoliation of graphite oxide with an oxygen-rich ferric acetyl acetonate complex. The synthesized materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, atomic force microscopy, and low temperature dc conductivity measurements. After exfoliation, the Fourier transform infrared studies reveal the decomposition of epoxy groups and the simultaneous formation of composites of iron oxide particles within the graphene oxide. Atomic force microscopy reveals the formation of an \u223c5nm thick graphene oxide stack with layered morphology. The layered morphology of graphene oxide degrades at higher concentrations of iron oxide. The vibrating sample magnetometer studies show ferromagnetic behavior of all composites in the range of 0.13\u20135.5 emu\/g at \u2026",

            "An environmentally-friendly method to separate cellulose and hemicelluloses from lignin in recalcitrant biomass for subsequent conversion is desirable to reduce greenhouse gas generation. Easily-prepared, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have low volatility, wide liquid range, non-flammability, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This study shows the DESs (formic acid:choline chloride, lactic acid:choline chloride, acetic acid:choline chloride, lactic acid:betaine, and lactic acid:proline) to be capable of preferentially dissolving lignin at 60 \u00b0C. Thermogravimetric analysis show DES to be stable at typical biomass processing temperatures. Pretreating loblolly pine in one DES increased glucose yield after enzymatic hydrolysis to more than seven times that of raw or glycerol-pretreated pine. The density of DES-pretreated biomass was found to be 40% higher than the untreated pine\u2019s density.",
