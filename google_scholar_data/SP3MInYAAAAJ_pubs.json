            "We report the construction of large new classes of models which break supersymmetry dynamically. We then turn to model building. Two of the principal obstacles to constructing simple models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking are the appearance of Fayet-Iliopoulos D terms and difficulties in generating a \u03bc term for the Higgs fields. Among the new models are examples in which symmetries prevent the appearance of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. A gauge singlet field, which may play a role in explaining the hierarchy in quark and lepton parameters, can generate a suitable \u03bc term. The result is a comparatively simple model, with a low energy structure similar to that of the MSSM, but with far fewer arbitrary parameters. We begin the study of the phenomenology of these models.",

Previous efforts to construct simple models of this sort have been hampered by the presence of axions. The present model, which exploits an observation of Bagger, Poppitz, and Randall to avoid this problem, is far simpler than previous constructions. Models of this kind do not suffer from the naturalness difficulties of conventional supergravity models, and make quite definite predictions for physics over a range of scales from 100\u2019s of GeV to 1000\u2019s of TeV. Thus \u2018\u2018renormalizable visible sector models\u2019\u2019are a viable alternative to more conventional approaches.

We show that under certain mild assumptions there is a universal equation for the gravitational fluctuations. We study both the graviton ground state and the continuum of Kaluza\u2013Klein modes and we find that the four-dimensional gravitational mode is localized precisely when the effects of the continuum modes decouple at distances larger than the fundamental Planck scale. The decoupling is contingent only on the long-range behaviour of the metric from the brane and we find a universal form for the corrections to Newton's law. We also comment on the possible \u2026",

            "Supersymmetry is one of the most plausible and theoretically motivated frameworks for extending the standard model. However, any supersymmetry in Nature must be a broken symmetry. Dynamical supersymmetry breaking (DSB) is an attractive idea for incorporating supersymmetry into a successful description of Nature. The study of DSB has recently enjoyed dramatic progress, fueled by advances in our understanding of the dynamics of supersymmetric field theories. These advances have allowed for direct analysis of DSB in strongly coupled theories, and for the discovery of new DSB theories, some of which contradict early criteria for DSB. The authors review these criteria, emphasizing recently discovered exceptions. They also describe, through many examples, various techniques for directly establishing DSB by studying the infrared theory, including both older techniques in regions of weak coupling and new \u2026",

            "We construct a calculable model of low-energy direct gauge mediation making use of the metastable supersymmetry breaking vacua recently discovered by Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih. The standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the global symmetries of the SUSY breaking sector and messengers play an essential role in dynamical SUSY breaking: they are composites of a confining gauge theory, and the holomorphic scalar messenger mass appears as a consequence of the confining dynamics. The SUSY breaking scale is around 100 TeV nevertheless the model is calculable. The minimal non-renormalizable coupling of the Higgs to the DSB sector leads in a simple way to a \u03bc-term, while the B-term arises at two-loop order resulting in a moderately large tan \u03b2. A novel feature of this class of models is that some particles from the dynamical SUSY breaking sector may be accessible at the LHC.",
