InAs epilayers are grown by molecular beam epitaxy and characterized by Hall measurements and optical techniques. We show that the plasma frequency of our material can be controlled across a broad range of mid-infrared frequencies. Subwavelength disks are fabricated out of our material, and localized plasmonic resonances are observed from these structures. Experimental results are compared to both numerical simulations and a simple quasistatic dipole model of our disks with good agreement.",

            "Surface plasmon polaritons and their localized counterparts, surface plasmons, are widely used at visible and near-infrared (near-IR) frequencies to confine, enhance, and manipulate light on the subwavelength scale. At these frequencies, surface plasmons serve as enabling mechanisms for future on-chip communications architectures, high-performance sensors, and high-resolution imaging and lithography systems. Successful implementation of plasmonics-inspired solutions at longer wavelengths, in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) frequency range, would benefit a number of highly important technologies in health- and defense-related fields that include trace-gas detection, heat-signature sensing, mimicking, and cloaking, and source and detector development. However, the body of knowledge of visible\/near-IR frequency plasmonics cannot be easily transferred to the mid-IR due to the fundamentally different material \u2026",

However, the wavelength of light required to excite these resonances is often orders of magnitude larger than the absorption cross sections of the molecules under investigation. This mismatch makes infrared detection and identification of nanoscale volumes of material challenging. Here we demonstrate a new type of infrared plasmonic antenna for long-wavelength nanoscale enhanced sensing. The plasmonic materials utilized are epitaxially grown semiconductor engineered metals, which results in high-quality, low-loss infrared plasmonic metals with tunable optical properties. Nanoantennas are fabricated using nanosphere lithography, allowing for cost-effective and large-area fabrication of nanoscale structures. Antenna arrays are \u2026",

The materials we focus on are the V 2-VI 3 family of TIs. These materials are ideally bulk insulating with surface states housing Dirac excitations which are spin-momentum locked. These surface states are interesting for fundamental physics studies (such as the search for Majorana fermions) as well as applications in spintronics and other fields. However, the majority of TI films and bulk crystals exhibit significant bulk conductivity, which obscures these states. In addition, many TI films have a high defect density. This review will discuss progress in reducing the bulk conductivity while increasing the crystal quality. We will describe in detail how growth parameters, substrate choice, and growth technique influence the resulting TI film properties for binary and ternary TIs. We then give an overview of progress in the growth of TI heterostructures. We close by discussing the bright future for TI film growth by MBE. View Full-Text",

Precise measurements by using a 14 MHz tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) allow detailed insight into the field and temperature dependence of \u03c7. In particular, local moment ferromagnets show a sharp peak in \u03c7 (T) near the Curie temperature, T C. The peak amplitude decreases and shifts to higher temperatures with very small applied dc fields. Anisotropic measurements of CeVSb 3 show that this peak is present provided the magnetic easy axis is aligned with the excitation field. In a striking contrast, small moment, itinerant ferromagnets (ie, ZrZn 2) show a broad maximum in \u03c7 (T) that responds differently to applied field.
