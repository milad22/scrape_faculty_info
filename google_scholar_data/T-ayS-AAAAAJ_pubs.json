            "Fundamental processes on the molecular level, such as vibrations and rotations in single molecules, liquids or crystal lattices and the breaking and formation of chemical bonds, occur on timescales of femtoseconds to picoseconds. The electronic changes associated with such processes can be monitored in a time-resolved manner by ultrafast optical spectroscopic techniques 1, but the accompanying structural rearrangements have proved more difficult to observe. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction has the potential to probe fast, atomic-scale motions 2, 3, 4, 5. This is made possible by the generation of ultrashort X-ray pulses 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and several X-ray studies of fast dynamics have been reported 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Here we report the direct observation of coherent acoustic phonon propagation in crystalline gallium arsenide using a non-thermal, ultrafast-laser-driven plasma\u2014a high-brightness, laboratory \u2026",

A 100 fs excitation pulse at 1.2 \u00e6m results in a 400 nm signal which is generated directly within the specimen. Chara plant rhizoids have been imaged, showing dynamic plant activity, and non-fading image characteristics even with continuous viewing, indicating prolonged viability under these THG-imaging conditions.",

A significant challenge in biological research is the dynamic imaging of features deep within living organisms, which permits the real-time analysis of cellular structure and function. To make progress in our understanding of biological machinery, optical microscopes must be capable of rapid, targeted access deep within samples at high resolution. In this Review, we discuss the basic architecture of a multiphoton microscope capable of such analysis and summarize the state-of-the-art technologies for the quantitative imaging of biological phenomena.",
