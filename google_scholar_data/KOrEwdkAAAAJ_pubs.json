            "The isolated, young, sunlike star TW Hya and four other young stars in its vicinity are strong x-ray sources. Their similar x-ray and optical properties indicate that the stars make up a physical association that is on the order of 20 million years old and that lies between about 40 and 60 parsecs (between about 130 and 200 light years) from Earth. TW Hya itself displays circumstellar CO, HCN, CN, and HCO+ emission. These molecules probably orbit the star in a solar-system\u2013sized disk viewed more or less face-on, whereas the star is likely viewed pole-on. Being at least three times closer to Earth than any well-studied region of star formation, the TW Hya Association serves as a test-bed for the study of x-ray emission from young stars and the formation of planetary systems around sunlike stars.",

Abundance anomalies are apparent, with iron very deficient relative to oxygen, while neon is enhanced relative to oxygen. Density\u2010sensitive line ratios of Ne ix and O vii indicate densities near log ne\u2009=\u200913. A flare with rapid (\u223c1 ks) rise time was detected during our 48 ks observation; however, based on analysis of the emission\u2010line spectrum during quiescent and flaring states, the derived plasma parameters do not seem strongly time\u2010dependent.

The submillimeter maps reveal that FU Orionis stars have accretion disks that are larger and contain an order of magnitude more mass than those of T Tauri stars but are comparable in mass to those seen around Class I sources. The disks around the FU Orionis stars are sufficiently massive to act as reservoirs of material for replenishing the mass of the disks after eruptions, in which large amounts of material are believed to fall onto the underlying stars. We have identified a number of FU Orionis stars that are surrounded by extended cloud emission, and in several cases we find nearby submillimeter sources that have no optical or near\u2010infrared counterparts. These sources most likely are young protostellar \u2026",

This pre-main-sequence source is the second in Taurus, the third in our survey, and the fifth known in the sky to show the broad 2166\/cm absorption feature. Of equal importance, this feature is not seen toward several other embedded sources in our survey, nor is it seen toward the source Elias 16, located behind the Taurus cloud. Laboratory experiments with interstellar ice analogs show that such a feature is associated with a complex C triple bonded to N containing compound (called X(C triple bonded to N)) that results from high-energy processing (ultraviolet irradiation or ion bombardment) of simple ice components into more complex, organic components. We find a nonlinear anticorrelation between the abundance of X(C triple bonded to N) and frozen CO components in nonpolar lattices. We find no correlation between the abundance of X(C triple bonded to N) and frozen CO in polar lattices. Because the abundances of frozen CO and H2O are strongly correlated with each other and with visual extinction toward sources embedded in and located behind the Taurus molecular cloud, these ice components usually are associated with intracloud material. Our results indicate that X(C triple bonded to N) molecules result from chemical processing of dust grains dominated by nonpolar icy mantles in the local environments of pre-main-sequence stars. Such processing of icy grains in the early solar system may be an important source of organic compounds observed in minor solar system bodies. The delivery of these organic \u2026",

            "Young, low-mass stars are luminous X-ray sources 1 whose powerful X-ray flares 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 may exert a profound influence over the process of planet formation 7. The origin of the X-ray emission is uncertain. Although many (or perhaps most) recently formed, low-mass stars emit X-rays as a consequence of solar-like coronal activity 1, 8, 9, it has also been suggested that X-ray emission may be a direct result of mass accretion onto the forming star 10, 11, 12. Here we report X-ray imaging spectroscopy observations which reveal a factor\u223c 50 increase in the X-ray flux from a young star that is at present undergoing a spectacular optical\/infrared outburst 13 (this star illuminates McNeil's nebula 14). The outburst seems to be due to the sudden onset of a phase of rapid accretion 13, 15, 16. The coincidence of a surge in X-ray brightness with the optical\/infrared eruption demonstrates that strongly enhanced high-energy \u2026",
