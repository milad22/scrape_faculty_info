These states are the Fock ground states of hamiltonians for fermions in even dimensional space with opposite sign mass terms coupled to identical static vector potentials. A perturbative analysis of the overlap in the continuum framework produces the correct anomaly for abelian gauge fields in two dimensions. When a lattice transfer matrix formalism is applied in the direction perpendicular to a domain wall on which chiral fermions live a lattice version of the overlap is obtained. The real part of the overlap is nonperturbatively defined and previous work indicates that the real part of the vacuum polarization tensor in four dimensions has the correct continuum limit for a chiral theory. The phase of the overlap represents the imaginary part of the chiral action and suffers from ambiguities.",

We also present a truncated version of regularized, pure gauge, supersymmetric models. The mechanism for generating almost masslessness is shown to be a generalized seesaw which can also be viewed as a version of the Froggatt-Nielsen method for obtaining natural large mass hierarchies. Viewed in this way the mechanism preserving the mass hierarchy naturally avoids preserving even approximately axial U (1). The new insights into the source of the mass hierarchy suggest ways to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of QCD employing the truncated overlap.",

The continuum operators maintain their character as unitary matrices and undergo a phase transition at infinite N reflected by the eigenvalue distribution closing a gap in its spectrum when the defining smooth loop is dilated from a small size to a large one. If this large N phase transition belongs to a solvable universality class one might be able to calculate analytically the string tension in terms of the perturbative \u039b-parameter. This would be achieved by matching instanton results for small loops to the relevant large-N-universal function which, in turn, would be matched for large loops to an effective string theory. Similarities between our findings and known analytical results in two dimensional space-time indicate that the phase transitions we found only affect the \u2026",
