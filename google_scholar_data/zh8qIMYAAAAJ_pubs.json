            "We determine the limiting dynamics of a fermionic condensate following a sudden perturbation for various initial conditions. Possible initial states of the condensate fall into two classes. In the first case, the order parameter asymptotes to a constant value. The approach to a constant is oscillatory with an inverse square root decay. This happens, eg, when the strength of pairing is abruptly changed while the system is in the paired ground state and more generally for any nonequilibrium state that is in the same class as the ground state. In the second case, the order parameter exhibits persistent oscillations with several frequencies. This is realized for nonequilibrium states that belong to the same class as excited stationary states.",

When cells are grown to a moderate density within a confining microenvironment, these traveling waves of cell density allow the cells to find and collapse into confining topologies, which are unstable to population fluctuations above a critical threshold. This was first observed in mazes designed to mimic complex environments, then more clearly in a simpler geometry consisting of a large open area surrounding a square (250 \u00d7 250 \u03bcm) with a narrow opening of 10\u201330 \u03bcm.

            "Bacterial gene expression is frequently regulated by small molecules secreted into the surrounding medium. These autoinducers build up with increasing cell number until a critical population density or \u201cquorum\u201d is achieved, at which point the cells produce a response such as virulence or biofilm formation that requires the coordinated activity of large numbers of individuals. It has generally been assumed that quorum formation derives primarily from conditions favorable for growth to high cell density (1). Numerous studies have shown that motility promotes biofilm formation, but this dependence has been attributed to random transport of cells from the bulk medium to a surface (2). Such experiments have been conducted with smooth surfaces that have no preferred surface sites or flow chambers where gradients of attractant chemicals will be dispersed. Here we show that, given appropriate surface topologies, bacteria can use chemotaxis to associate and form a quorum. Thus, chemotaxis provides an important mechanism for establishing the high local cell densities required for quorum-dependent interactions. A culture of Escherichia coli grown to moderate density (approximately 2 108 cells\/ml) in either rich media or in minimal media was used to uniformly fill a microfluidic chamber (7 mm by 3 mm by 30 m) with a small central enclosure (250 m by 250 m) constructed from silicone elastomer. Over the course of 1 to 3 hours (depending on the media), the cells migrate from the chamber into the central enclosure through a narrow (40 m) channel (Fig. 1A). This behavior is not observed with a mutant strain that is motile but deficient in chemotaxis \u2026",

            "We study the dynamic response of an s-wave BCS-BEC (atomic-molecular) condensate to detuning quenches within the two-channel model beyond the weak-coupling BCS limit. At long times after the quench, the condensate ends up in one of three main asymptotic states (nonequilibrium phases), which are qualitatively similar to those in other fermionic condensates defined by a global complex order parameter. In phase I the amplitude of the order parameter vanishes as a power law, in phase II it goes to a nonzero constant, and in phase III it oscillates persistently. We construct exact quench phase diagrams that predict the asymptotic state (including the many-body wave function) depending on the initial and final detunings and on the Feshbach resonance width. Outside of the weak-coupling regime, both the mechanism and the time dependence of the relaxation of the amplitude of the order parameter in phases I \u2026",
