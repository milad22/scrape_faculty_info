The optimal arrangement of the control sites is shown to depend on the symmetry properties of the system, while their minimal density depends on the strength of noise in the system. The method is shown to work in any region of parameter space and requires a significantly smaller number of controllers compared to the method proposed earlier by Hu and Qu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 68 (1994)]. A nonlinear generalization of the method for a 1D lattice is also presented.",

The flow is manipulated by thermally induced surface-tension gradients that are regulated by controlling the absorption of light in the substrate. This approach permits, for the first time, the measurement of the dispersion relation for the well-known contact line instability; the measurements are compared with theoretical predictions from the slip model for spreading films. The experiments also demonstrate the use of feedback control to suppress instability. These results show that optical control can provide dynamically reconfigurable manipulations of fluid flow, thereby suggesting a general approach for constructing reprogrammable microfluidic devices.",

            "In the process of drying, thin volatile liquid films often undergo a long-wavelength instability leading to nonuniformities or formation of dry spots, with the strength of the instability increasing with the volatility and temperature of the liquid. Perhaps counterintuitively, this evaporative instability can be actively suppressed by an appropriate heating procedure. We use linear stability analysis of the lubrication approximation to show that spatially nonuniform time-dependent radiative heating can indeed have a stabilizing effect. Evaporation is shown to introduce several fundamentally new aspects into the control problem for heated liquid films, compared to the relatively well-studied case of thermal convection. The control problem becomes especially interesting and nontrivial for mixtures and solutions with negative Marangoni numbers due to a peculiar cancellation effect rendering the system insensitive to temperature \u2026",

We demonstrate the dynamical importance of these solutions by showing that turbulent flows visit their state space neighborhoods repeatedly.

We show that thermal perturbations of certain spatial structure imposed behind the contact line and proportional to the deviation of the contact line from its mean position can completely suppress the instability. Due to the presence of mean flow and a spatially nonuniform nature of spreading liquid films the dynamics of disturbances is governed by a non-normal evolution operator, opening up a possibility of transient amplification and nonlinear instabilities.

However, recent experimental results have shown that removing most of the air from a sealed cavity significantly alters the flow structure and, in particular, suppresses transitions between different convection patterns found at atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, removing air has a very small effect on the flow speed, while a simple analytical estimate predicts that complete removal of noncondensable gases such as air should reduce the flow speed by an order of magnitude. To understand these unexpected results, we have formulated and numerically implemented a detailed transport model that takes into account mass and heat transport in both phases in the absence of noncondensables.
