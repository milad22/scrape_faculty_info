            "Scalar quintessence seems epicyclic because one can choose the potential to reproduce any cosmology (I review the construction) and because the properties of this scalar seem to raise more questions than they answer. This is why there has been so much recent interest in modified gravity. I review the powerful theorem of Ostrogradski which demonstrates that the only potentially stable, local modification of general relativity is to make the Lagrangian an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar. Such a theory can certainly reproduce the current phase of cosmic acceleration without Dark Energy. However, this explanation again seems epicyclic in that one can construct a function of the Ricci scalar to support any cosmology (I give the technique). Models of this form are also liable to problems in the way they couple to matter, both in terms of matter\u2019s impact upon them and in terms of the long range gravitational \u2026",

This model is important because it demonstrates that quantum effects can lead to violations of the weak energy condition on cosmological scales\u2014on average, not just in fluctuations\u2014although the effect in this particular model is far too small to be observed. The revision consists of modifying the propagator so that dimensional regularization can be used when the dimension of the renormalized theory is not four. Although the finite part of the stress-energy tensor does not change (in D= 4) from our previous result, the counterterms do. We also speculate that a certain, finite and separately conserved part of the stress tensor can be subsumed into a natural correction of the initial state from free Bunch \u2026",

We then employ it to compute the fully renormalized stress tensor at one-and two-loop orders for a massless, minimally coupled phgr 4 theory which is released in Bunch\u2013Davies vacuum at t= 0 in co-moving coordinates. In this system, the uncertainty principle elevates the scalar above the minimum of its potential, resulting in a phase of super-acceleration. With the non-derivative self-interaction the scalar's breaking of de Sitter invariance becomes observable. It is also worth noting that the weak-energy condition is violated on cosmological scales. An interesting subsidiary result is that cancelling overlapping divergences in the stress tensor requires a conformal counterterm which has no effect on purely scalar diagrams.",

Manifestly Poincar\u00e9 invariant theories are shown to be unstable and bereft of an initial value formulation; light cone theories suffer from a breakdown of Lorentz invariance. However, because free string actions are local up to a field redefinition these problems are invisible to perturbative analysis. The use of perturbation theory is shown to change the causal and canonical structure of the covariant formulations. One consequence is the loss of the infinite number of nonperturbative solutions associated with the freedom to prescribe arbitrarily many initial time derivatives. Since these solutions also contain the negative energy degrees of freedom which destabilize the theory both covariant problems are avoided in this way. The penalty is acausality. This is fundamental property of the light cone formalism. It can be avoided in the \u2026",

            "A non-zero cosmological constant allows massless gravitons to self-interact via a coupling of dimension three. If the cosmological constant is positive then the background geometry will subject gravitons to an enormous redshift. These two facts are together responsible for the severe infrared divergences which detailed, explicit calculations [N.C. Tsamis and R.P. Woodard, Strong infrared effects in quantum gravity, preprint CRETE-92-17, UFIFT-92-24] reveal in loop corrections to the gravitational force law. We argue that, as a result, the cosmological interaction has a finite lifetime. Furthermore, this lifetime is consistent with inflation.",
