            "A simple, green method is described for the synthesis of Gold (Au) and Silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) from the stem extract of Breynia rhamnoides. Unlike other biological methods for NP synthesis, the uniqueness of our method lies in its fast synthesis rates (\u223c7 min for AuNPs) and the ability to tune the nanoparticle size (and subsequently their catalytic activity) via the extract concentration used in the experiment. The phenolic glycosides and reducing sugars present in the extract are largely responsible for the rapid reduction rates of Au3+ ions to AuNPs. Efficient reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of AuNPs (or AgNPs) and NaBH4 was observed and was found to depend upon the nanoparticle size or the stem extract concentration used for synthesis.",

            "The potential applications of nanomaterials as drug delivery systems and in other products continue to expand. Upon introduction into physiological environments and driven by energetics, nanomaterials readily associate proteins forming a protein corona (PC) on their surface. This PC influences the nanomaterial\u2019s surface characteristics and may impact their interaction with cells. To determine the biological impact of nanomaterial exposure as well as nanotherapeutic applications, it is necessary to understand PC formation. Utilizing a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we examined the composition of the PC for a set of four silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) including citrate-stabilized and polyvinlypyrrolidone-stabilized (PVP) colloidal silver (20 or 110 nm diameter). To simulate cell culture conditions, AgNPs were incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, washed, coronal proteins solubilized, and proteins identified and quantified by label-free LC-MS\/MS. To determine which attributes influence PC formation, the AgNPs were characterized in both water and cell culture media with 10% FBS. All AgNPs associated a common subset of 11 proteins including albumin, apolipoproteins, keratins, and other serum proteins. 110 nm citrate- and PVP-stabilized AgNPs were found to bind the greatest number of proteins (79 and 85 respectively) compared to 20 nm citrate- and PVP-stabilized AgNPs (45 and 48 respectively), suggesting a difference in PC formation based on surface curvature.

A peak at \u223c1860 cm\u22121 (iTALO\u2212) is observed due to a combination of the in-plane transverse acoustic (iTA) and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The intensity of this peak decreases with increasing number of layers and this peak is absent for bulk graphite. The overtone of the out-of-plane transverse optical (oTO) phonon at \u223c1750 cm\u22121, also called the M band, is suppressed for both SLG and IBLG. In addition, two previously unidentified modes at \u223c2200 and \u223c1880 cm\u22121 are observed in SLG.

Therefore, some concerns about the possible human health and environmental impacts of manufactured MWCNTs are rising. We hypothesized that instillation of MWCNTs impairs pulmonary function in C57BL\/6 mice due to development of lung inflammation and fibrosis. MWCNTs were administered to C57BL\/6 mice by oropharyngeal aspiration (1, 2, and 4 mg\/kg) and we assessed lung inflammation and fibrosis by inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen content, and histological assessment. Pulmonary function was assessed using a FlexiVent system and levels of Ccl3, Ccl11, Mmp13 and IL-33 were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA. Mice administered MWCNTs exhibited increased inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and granuloma formation in lung tissue, which correlated with impaired pulmonary function as assessed by increased resistance, tissue damping, and decreased lung compliance. Pulmonary exposure to MWCNTs induced an inflammatory signature marked by cytokine (IL-33), chemokine (Ccl3 and Ccl11), and protease production (Mmp13) that promoted the inflammatory and fibrotic changes observed within the lung. These results further highlight the potential adverse health effects that may occur following MWCNT exposure and therefore we suggest these materials may pose a significant risk leading to impaired lung function following environmental and occupational exposures.",

Though this property was attributed to the presence of defects, systematic experimental and theoretical studies to pinpoint its origin and mechanism are lacking. While it is widely believed that oxygen vacancies are responsible for FM ordering, surprisingly we find that annealing as-prepared samples at low temperature (high temperature) in flowing oxygen actually enhances (diminishes) the FM ordering. For these reasons, we have prepared, annealed in different environments, and measured the ensuing magnetization in micrometer and nanoscale ZnO with varying crystallinity. We further find from our magnetization measurements and ab initio calculations that a range of magnetic properties in ZnO can result, depending on the sample preparation and annealing conditions.
