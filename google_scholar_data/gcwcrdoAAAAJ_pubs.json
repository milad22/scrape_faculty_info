            "The current understanding of the behavior of quantum chromodynamics at finite temperature is presented. Perturbative methods are used to explore the high-temperature dynamics. At sufficiently high temperatures the plasma of thermal excitations screens all color electric fields and quarks are unconfined. It is believed that the high-temperature theory develops a dynamical mass gap. However in perturbation theory the infrared behavior of magnetic fluctuations is so singular that beyond some order the perturbative expansion breaks down. The topological classification of finite-energy, periodic fields is presented and the classical solutions which minimize the action in each topological sector are examined. These include periodic instantons and magnetic monopoles. At sufficiently high temperature only fields with integral topological charge can contribute to the functional integral.

Integrating out all degrees of freedom except this order parameter generates an effective scalar field theory for the order parameter, globally invariant under the center symmetry. We argue that the effective theory possesses only short-range couplings, and hence that the finite-temperature confinement phase transition (when continuous) is accompanied by long-range fluctuations only in the order parameter. Universality ideas then lead to predictions for the critical properties of U(1), Z(N), and SU(N) gauge theories for all dimensionalities of space-time. An explicit renormalization-group calculation is presented for the U(1) gauge theory in (2 + 1) dimensions, the results of which fit the general picture.",

A general method for finding classical limits in arbitrary quantum theories is developed. The method is based on certain assumptions which isolate the minimal structure any quantum theory should possess if it is to have a classical limit. In any theory satisfying these assumptions, one can generate a natural set of generalized coherent states. These coherent states may then be used to construct a classical phase space, derive a classical Hamiltonian, and show that the resulting classical dynamics is equivalent to the limiting form of the original quantum dynamics. This formalism is shown to be applicable to the large N limits of vector models, matrix models, and gauge theories. In every case, one can explicitly derive a classical action which contains the complete physics of the N=\u221e theory.\" Solving\" \u2026",

A brief review is given of the classical gravitational instabilities, as well as the stability of flat space. The Euclidean path-integral representation of the partition function is employed to discuss the instability of flat space at finite temperature. Semiclassical, or saddle-point, approximations are utilized. We show how the Jeans instability arises as a tachyon in the graviton propagator when small perturbations about hot flat space are considered. The effect due to the Schwarzschild instanton is studied. The small fluctuations about this instanton are analyzed and a negative mode is discovered. This produces, in the semiclassical approximation, an imaginary part of the free energy. This is interpreted as being due to the metastability of hot flat space to nucleate black holes. These then evolve by evaporation or by \u2026",
