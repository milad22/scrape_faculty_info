They all share the same basic building blocks, but there is significant variation in their physical properties, such as magnetic ordered moments, effective masses, superconducting gaps and transition temperature (T c). Many theoretical techniques have been applied to individual compounds but no consistent description of the microscopic origin of these variations is available 2. Here we carry out a comparative theoretical study of a large number of iron-based compounds in both their magnetic and paramagnetic states. Taking into account correlation effects and realistic band structures, we describe well the trends in all of the physical properties such as the ordered moments, effective masses and Fermi surfaces across all families of iron compounds, and find them to \u2026",

Steady-state spectroscopy carried out over a broad range of frequencies from microwaves to UV light and fast optics time-resolved techniques provides complimentary prospectives on correlations.

Below a coherence scale T*, the resistivity sharply drops and susceptibility crosses over to Pauli-like temperature dependence. Remarkably, the coherence\u2013incoherence crossover temperature is a very strong function of the strength of Hund's rule coupling J Hund. On the basis of the normal state properties, we estimate J Hund to be~ 0.35 eV. In the atomic limit, this value of J Hund leads to the critical ratio of the exchange \u2026",

We compare cluster-DMFT results with those of single-site DMFT. We show that inclusion of the short-range correlations on top of the on-site correlations does not change the order of the transition between the paramagnetic metal and the paramagnetic Mott insulator, which remains first order. However, the short range correlations reduce substantially the critical U and modify the shape of the transition lines. Moreover, they lead to very different physical properties of the metallic and insulating phases near the transition point. Approaching the transition from the metallic side, we find an anomalous metallic state with very low coherence scale.
