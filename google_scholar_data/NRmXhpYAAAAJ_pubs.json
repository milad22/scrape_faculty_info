Data were obtained by analyzing the steady\u2010state photoconductive response to frequency\u2010doubled CO2 radiation, at intensities varying by over four orders of magnitude. Theoretical Auger rates were derived, based on a k\u22c5p calculation of the superlattice band structure in a model which employs no adjustable parameters. At 77 K, both experiment and theory yield Auger lifetimes which are approximately two orders of magnitude longer than those in Hg1\u2212xCdxTe with the same energy gap.

            "A comparison is performed between measured and calculated Auger recombination rates for four different narrow-gap superlattices based on the InAs\/GaSb\/AlSb material system. The structures are designed for optical or electrical injection for mid-infrared laser applications, with wavelengths ranging from 3.4 to 4.1 \u03bcm. The electronic band structures are computed employing an accurate 14-band restricted basis set (superlattice K\u22c5p) methodology that utilizes experimental information about the low-energy electronic structure of the bulk constituents. The superlattice band structures and their associated matrix elements are directly employed to compute Auger recombination rates. Varying amounts of Auger recombination suppression are displayed by the various superlattices as compared to bulk mid-infrared systems. The greatest disagreement between theory and experiment is shown for the structure predicted to \u2026",

The broadening of the Raman line in the frequency domain was found to be predominantly caused by the anharmonic decay of optical phonons into lower-energy acoustic phonons, resulting in a line broadening that is inversely proportional to the average isotopic mass m. Isotopic disorder contributes only a little to the line broadening and depends on the isotopic composition of the material. From the phonon linewidths the anharmonic decay time of optical phonons in Ge at 80 K was \u2026",

The fully K\u2010dependent band structure and momentum matrix elements, obtained from a superlattice K\u22c5p calculation, are used to calculate the limiting Auger and radiative recombination rates and the threshold current density. InGaAsSb quantum wells and InAs\/InGaSb superlattices are found to be more promising laser candidates than HgCdTe superlattices and InAsSb bulk ternaries. The calculated threshold current densities of InAs\/InGaSb superlattices are similar to those of InGaAsSb active layers at 2.1 \u03bcm, but are significantly lower at longer wavelengths. Comparison with experiment indicates that the threshold current densities of InGaAsSb\u2010based devices are about three times greater than those \u2026",
