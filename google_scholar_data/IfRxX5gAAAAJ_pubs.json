            "We extend earlier ideas about the appearance of noncommutative geometry in string theory with a nonzero B-field. We identify a limit in which the entire string dynamics is described by a minimally coupled (supersymmetric) gauge theory on a noncommutative space, and discuss the corrections away from this limit. Our analysis leads us to an equivalence between ordinary gauge fields and noncommutative gauge fields, which is realized by a change of variables that can be described explicitly. This change of variables is checked by comparing the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld theory with its noncommutative counterpart. We obtain a new perspective on noncommutative gauge theory on a torus, its T-duality, and Morita equivalence. We also discuss the D0\/D4 system, the relation to M-theory in DLCQ, and a possible noncommutative version of the six-dimensional (2, 0) theory.",

            "Recently, it has become clear that certain aspects of four dimensional supersymmetric field theories can be analyzed exactly, providing a laboratory for the analysis of the dynamics of gauge theories (for a recent elementary presentation and a list of references see Ref.1). For example, the phases of gauge theories and the mechanisms for phase transitions can be explored in this context. The dynamical mechanisms explored are standard to gauge theories and thus, at least at a qualitative level, the insights obtained are expected to also be applicable for non-supersymmetric theories. We summarize some of the recent ideas. The discussion is not in historical order and other examples appear in the literature.",

For N \u0192< N there is a unique superpotential which might be generated by non-perturbative effects. We show that it indeed appears, thus violating the non-renormalization theorems. For N \u0192= N\u2212 1 instantons produce the superpotential. For N \u0192< N\u2212 1 it is again generated, provided that a mild assumption about the dynamics of pure supersymmetric gauge theories is correct. For N \u0192\u2a7e N no invariant superpotential exists; the classical vacuum degeneracy is a property of the full quantum theory. When a small quark mass term is added to the theory (for N \u0192< N), N supersymmetric ground states, identified with those found by Witten exist. As m\u2192 0 these N vacua wander to infinity, leaving the massless theory without a ground state.",
