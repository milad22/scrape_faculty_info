The measurement utilizes the temperature dependence of the resistance as a self-thermometer; heat is injected by an additional dc current. We find that for our sample the energy relaxation rate below 1 K is \u03c4 \u025b\u2212 1=(2.5\u00d7 10 6) T 3 sec\u2212 1 K\u2212 3.",

            "The crossover from weak to strong localization in the resistance of quasi-1D conductors is observed for the first time with decreasing the temperature; it occurs when the phase-breaking length becomes comparable with the localization length. The signature of the strong-localization regime is an activation-type temperature dependence of the resistance and exponentially strong negative magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistance is well described by the theory of doubling of the localization length in quasi-1D conductors in strong fields; this provides a direct measurement of the localization length.",

The Coulomb anomaly and weak localization were used as thermometers for the electrons. We confirm that at temperatures below 1 K the electron temperatures as derived from either the Coulomb anomaly or weak localization are consistent. The electron-phonon energy relaxation rate was measured to be proportional to T 3. Our results disagree with theoretical calculations of the electron-phonon rates for dirty metals which predict electron-phonon scattering rates proportional to T 4 for three-dimensional phonons.",
