            "Electrons in correlated insulators are prevented from conducting by Coulomb repulsion between them. When an insulator-to-metal transition is induced in a correlated insulator by doping or heating, the resulting conducting state can be radically different from that characterized by free electrons in conventional metals. We report on the electronic properties of a prototypical correlated insulator vanadium dioxide in which the metallic state can be induced by increasing temperature. Scanning near-field infrared microscopy allows us to directly image nanoscale metallic puddles that appear at the onset of the insulator-to-metal transition. In combination with far-field infrared spectroscopy, the data reveal the Mott transition with divergent quasi-particle mass in the metallic puddles. The experimental approach used sets the stage for investigations of charge dynamics on the nanoscale in other inhomogeneous correlated \u2026",

It is followed by Chapter 219 sorting out relationships between superconductivity and magnetism. The next two chapters are dedicated to complex compounds of rare earths: Chapter 220 describes structural studies using circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy of lanthanide systems, while Chapter 221 examines rare-earth metal-organic frameworks, also known as coordination polymers. The final Chapter 222 deals with the catalytic activity of rare earths in site-selective hydrolysis of DNA and RNA.",

            "Filled skutterudite antimonides 1, 2 are cubic compounds with the formula RM 4 Sb 12, where R is a rare-earth element (such as La or Ce), and M is a transition metal (for example, Fe or Co). The rare-earth ion is weakly bound in an oversized atomic cage formed by the other atoms. Its presence has been shown to cause a dramatic reduction in the lattice component of the thermal conductivity, while having little effect on the electronic properties 3, 4, 5 of the compound. This combination of properties makes filled skutterudites of interest as thermoelectric materials. It has been suggested 4 that localized, incoherent vibrations of the rare-earth ion are responsible for the reduction in thermal conductivity, but no direct evidence for these local vibrational modes exists. Here we report the observation of local modes in La-filled skutterudites, using heat capacity, elastic constant and inelastic neutron scattering measurements \u2026",
