We compare our observations with collisional\u2010radiative models using atomic data computed in distorted wave and R\u2010matrix approximations, which follow the transfer of the polarization of level populations through radiative cascades. Our results for the intensity ratio of the   15.014 \u00c5 line to the   15.265 \u00c5 line are   and   at beam energies of 900 and 1250 eV, respectively. These results are not consistent with collisional\u2010radiative models and support conclusions from earlier EBIT work at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that the degree of resonance scattering in the solar 15.014 \u00c5 line has been overestimated in previous analyses.

This measurement is one of few sensitive to two-electron QED contributions. Systematic errors such as Doppler shifts are minimized in our experiment by trapping and stripping Ti atoms in an electron beam ion trap and by applying absolute wavelength standards to calibrate the dispersion function of a curved-crystal spectrometer. We also report a more general systematic discrepancy between QED theory and experiment for the w transition energy in heliumlike ions for Z> 20. When all of the data available in the literature for Z= 16\u201392 are taken into account, the divergence is seen to grow as approximately Z 3 with a statistical significance on the coefficient that rises to the level of 5 standard deviations.

Focusing on the northeast jet filaments, we analyze the polar regions of the recently acquired very deep 1 Ms Chandra X\u2010ray observation. We infer that the so\u2010called \u201cjet\u201d regions are indeed due to jets emanating from the explosion center and not due to polar cavities in the circumstellar medium at the time of explosion. We place limits on the equivalent isotropic explosion energy in the polar regions (around   ergs) and the opening angle of the X\u2010ray\u2010emitting ejecta (around 7\u00b0), which give a total energy in the northeast jet of the order of 1050 ergs, an order of magnitude or more lower than inferred for \u201ctypical\u201d GRBs.

            "A custom, flat field, extreme ultraviolet spectrometer built specifically for use with low power light sources that operate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions is reported. The spectral range of the spectrometer extends from 4 nm to 40 nm. The instrument optimizes the light gathering power and signal-to-noise ratio while achieving good resolution. A detailed description of the spectrometer and design considerations are presented, as well as a procedure that could be used to obtain a synthetic wavelength calibration with the aid of only a single known spectral feature. This synthetic wavelength calibration is compared to a standard wavelength calibration obtained from previously reported spectral lines of Xe, Ar, and Ne ions recorded with this spectrometer.",

            "X-ray plasma images were made at the 14.5 GHz electron cyclotron resonance ion source of ATOMKI using a pinhole and a high resolution CCD camera. This method has good spatial resolution as well as the capability of postprocessed energy filtering of the images. During the measurements low and high charge state Ar, Xe, and Fe plasmas were produced with simultaneous beam extraction. Full-size and selected region images were recorded and analyzed. Full-size x-ray images show the spatial positions of different sources of x rays (bremsstrahlung, characteristic lines of plasma and wall ions) within low-charged ECRIS plasmas. Images of selected plasma regions (extraction slit, magnet pole, magnet gap) offer a better understanding of the effect of important tuning parameters (bias disk voltage, gas mixing, microwave power, magnetic field strength, etc.) commonly used to produce highly charged plasmas \u2026",
