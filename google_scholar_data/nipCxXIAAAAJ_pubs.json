            " The new penology argues that an important new language of penology is emerging. This new language, which has its counterparts in other areas of the law as well, shifts focus away from the traditional concerns of the criminal law and criminology, which have focused on the individual, and redirects it to actuarial consideration of aggregates. This shift has a number of important implications: It facilitates development of a vision or model of a new type of criminal process that embraces increased reliance on imprisonment and that merges concerns for surveillance and custody, that shifts away from a concern with punishing individuals to managing aggregates of dangerous groups, and that affects the training and practice of criminologists.",

            "Introduction1 na recent article we argued that there is a paradigm shift taking place in the criminal process. Focusing on selected issues of penology, we examined what we termed the Old Penology and the New Penology (Feeley and Simon, 1992: 449). In this chapter we broaden this argument, and outline the features of this new development, which we term actuarial justice. In the earlier paper we argued that the Old Penology is rooted in a concern for individuals, and preoccupied with such concepts as guilt, responsibility and obligation, as well as diagnosis, intervention and treatment of the individual offender. It views committing a crime a deviant or antisocial act which is deserving of a response, and one of its central aims is to ascertain the nature of the responsibility of the accused and hold the guilty accountable. In contrast the New Penology has a radically different orientation. It is actuarial. It is concerned with techniques for identifying, classifying and managing groups assorted by levels of dangerousness. It takes crime for granted. It accepts deviance as normal. It is sceptical that liberal interventionist crime control strategies do or can make a difference. Thus its aim is not to intervene in individuals' lives for the purpose of ascertaining responsibility, making the guilty \u2018pay for their crime'or changing them. Rather it seeks to regulate groups as part of a strategy of managing danger.In our article (Feeley and Simon, 1992) we addressed the general logic of the New Penology in terms of discourses techniques and objectives. Here in our more general enquiry we explore how \u2018actuarial justice', is being institutionalised and survey the broader \u2026",

            "F all the problems besetting the poor inner-city bfack community, none is more pressing than that of interpersonal violence and aggression. It wreaks havoc daily with the lives of community residents and increasingly spills over into downtown and residential middleclass areas. Muggings, burglaries, carjackings, and drug-related shootings, all of which may leave their victims or innocent bystanders dead, are now common enough to concern all urban and many suburban residents. The inclination to violence springs from the circumstances of life among the ghetto poor\u2014the lack of jobs that pay a living wage, the stigma of race, the fallout from rampant drug use and drug trafficking, and the resulting alienation and lack of hope for the future. Simply living in such an environment places young people at special risk of falling victim to aggressive behavior. Although there are often forces in the community which can counteract",

            "This powerful book reveals how modern strategies of punishment\u2014and, by all accounts, their failure\u2014relate to political and economic transformations in society at large. Jonathan Simon uses the practice of parole in California as a window to the changing historical understanding of what a corrections system does and how it works. Because California is representative of policies and practices on a national level, Simon explicitly presents his findings within a national framework. When parole first emerged as a corrections strategy in the nineteenth century, work was supposed to keep ex-prisoners out of trouble. This strategy foundered in the changing economy after World War II. What followed was a rehabilitative strategy, where the clinical expertise of the parole agent replaced the discipline of the industrial labor market in defining and controlling criminal deviance. Today, Simon argues, as drastic changes in the economy have virtually locked out an entire class, rehabilitation has given way to mere management. The effect is isolation of the offender, either in jail or in an underclass community; the result is an escalating cycle of imprisonment, destabilization, and insecurity. No significant improvement in the current penal crisis can be expected until we better understand the relationship between punishment and social order, a relationship which this book explores in theoretical, historical, and practical detail.",

            "This book describes the extent and type of female involvement in crime in the United States. It presents statistics describing trends in the proportion of women who have been arrested, convicted, sentenced, and paroled over the past two decades. It compares the types of crimes in which women have been most visible. It considers the relationship between the extent of female participation in the labor force at various levels with the anticipated participation of women in the criminal labor market. The first section reviews the literature on women in crime. It notes the lack of attention that the topic has received in the basic and standard texts in criminology, and it summarizes the major themes in the research that has been done in this area. The other two chapters in this section summarize the current status that women occupy in society as represented by the extent and quality of their participation in the labor force, their marriage and fertility patterns, their incomes and education; these chapters also review the major objectives and goals of the contemporary women's movement. This section also provides a framework for the subsequent analysis of women's participation in criminal activities. The second section describes women's participation in crime and the treatment women receive at various stages in the criminal justice process. The first chapter compares the proportion of women as opposed to men who have been arrested over the past two decades, and breaks down the types of crimes for which they have been arrested. The next chapter follows women into the courtroom and reports the proportion of women as opposed to men who have been \u2026",

            "Over the last century there has been significant growth within our society of practices that distribute costs and benefits to individuals based on statistical knowledge about the population. These actuarial practices like insurance premium setting and standardized testing in educational admissions are successful largely because they allow power to be exercised more effectively and at lower political cost. At the same time they generate ideological effects which have the potential to transform the way individuals understand themselves and their groups. In a 1977 case, Los Angeles Water and Power v. Manhart (435 U.S. 702), the United States Supreme Court considered a challenge to the actuarial use of gender in setting employee benefits. The case and the debates it generated illuminate the danger posed by the ideological effects of actuarial practices to our political culture in general, and to traditionally \u2026",

            "Sex offenders were once taken to be exemplary of the underlying psychopathological basis of crime. Today their significance is very different. Rather than occasions for testing our modernist faith in scientific rationality, they have become a lesson in the intransigence of evil. Recent laws aimed at addressing sex offenders reflect a transformation in the penal process that has been called the \u201cnew penology.\u201d This new penology sees crime as a problem of managing high-risk categories and subpopulations, not normalizing individuals to community norms. Kansas v. Hendricks and recent cases upholding the constitutionality of \u201cMegan\u2019s Law\u201d open a window into the operation of the new penology and reveal the degree to which its features are largely immune from constitutional limits established by judicial review.",
