            "Curcumin is a natural phenolic component of yellow curry spice, which is used in some cultures for the treatment of diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Curcumin has been reported to be capable of preventing the death of neurons in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, but its possible effects on developmental and adult neuroplasticity are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of curcumin on mouse multi-potent neural progenitor cells (NPC) and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Curcumin exerted biphasic effects on cultured NPC; low concentrations stimulated cell proliferation, whereas high concentrations were cytotoxic. Curcumin activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 kinases, cellular signal transduction pathways known to be involved in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and stress responses.

Hence, chemopreventive effects of plant polysaccharides [Aloe barbadensis Miller (APS), Lentinus edodes (LPS), Ganoderma lucidum (GPS) and Coriolus versicolor (CPS)] were compared using in vitro short-term screening methods associated with both initiation and promotion processes in carcinogenesis. In B[a]P\u2013DNA adduct formation, APS (180 \u03bcg\/ml) was the most effective in inhibition of B[a]P binding to DNA in mouse liver cells. Oxidative DNA damage (by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) was significantly decreased by APS (180 \u03bcg\/ml) and CPS (180 \u03bcg\/ml). In induction of glutathione S-transferase activity, GPS was found to be the most effective among plant polysaccharides. In screening anti-tumor promoting effects, APS (180 \u03bcg\/ml) significantly inhibited phorbol \u2026",

However, COX-2 also suppresses skin tumorigenesis and their relationship with SIRT6, making it an interesting target for the discovery of drugs with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Herein, we studied the interaction of thieno [3, 2-c] pyran analogs and RONS species with SIRT6 and COX-2 through the use of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations. Molecular docking studies revealed the importance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues for the stability. The molecular dynamics study examined conformational changes in the enzymes caused by the binding of the substrates and how those changes affected the stability of the protein-drug complex.
