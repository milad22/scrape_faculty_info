            "This study reports facile hydrothermal strategies for the synthesis of novel ternary \u03b1-Fe2O3\u2013ZnO\u2013Au nanocomposites under mild conditions, through further surface coating of ZnO and Au nanoparticles (NPs) on \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanorods. The ternary \u03b1-Fe2O3\u2013ZnO\u2013Au nanocomposites are found to show (1) higher sensitivity\/responses (S) of 113 and 57 toward 100-ppm n-butanol and acetone, respectively compared to single \u03b1-Fe2O3 (S = 11.7, 9.1 for n-butanol, acetone) and binary \u03b1-Fe2O3-ZnO (S = 54.4, 28 for n-butanol, acetone) sensing materials, and (2) lower optimum operating temperature, i.e., 225 \u00b0C. The enhanced sensitivity could be attributed to the chemical sensitization effect induced by the Au NPs, and the existence of conjugated depletion layers in the nanocomposites which promote a greater drop in resistance upon exposure to the gas. These results will be useful for future design of iron oxide-based \u2026",

            "This study reports a facile solvothermal method for the synthesis of tin oxide (SnO2) flower-like nanorods with dominant (1 1 0) crystal surface, which could be further decorated with varying amounts of noble metals, (gold (Au) and palladium (Pd)) to enhance the gas-sensing properties. Analysis of the gas-sensing results reveal that the decoration of Au and Pd nanoparticles on the surface of the SnO2 nanorods is advantageous in: (i) enhancing the sensitivity towards ethanol (9\u201315 times); (ii) reducing the response\/recovery time (by 15\u201340 s), and (iii) significantly decreasing the optimum operating temperature (from 250 to 175 \u00b0C). Beyond physical experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) method was also conducted to quantify diffusivity, adsorption and reaction capabilities of ethanol on SnO2(1 1 0) plane and to better understand the role of noble metals in enhancing the gas-sensing performance of SnO2.

The achieved relative density is better than 99 % when iron oxide content is smaller than 2 %V. Agglomeration of nanoparticles is observed at larger content. Composites were submitted to an alternating magnetic field of 1000\u202fG maximum intensity and 250\u202fkHz frequency. A fast heating of the sample was observed thanks to the magnetic particles (Tmax\u202f\u2248\u202f450\u202f\u00b0C). A treatment of 1\u202fh at Tmax promoted some viscoelastic relaxation at an indentation site but was not sufficient to induce some visible crack healing.",

The sintered composites were dense and transparent, but for the largest gold content where the sample exhibits a deep red color. When submitted to laser irradiation (532\u202fnm, up to 100\u202fW\/cm2), the composite experiences a fast, localized and much more significant increase of its temperature in comparison with the pristine glass material.
