            "The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) provides a unique way to map the large-scale structure of the universe as traced by massive clusters of galaxies. As a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, the SZE is insensitive to the redshift of the galaxy cluster, making it well-suited for studies of clusters at all redshifts, and especially at reasonably high redshifts (z > 1) where the abundance of clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology. Recent high signal-to-noise detections of the SZE have enabled interesting constraints on the Hubble constant and on the matter density of the universe using small samples of galaxy clusters. Upcoming SZE surveys are expected to find hundreds to thousands of new galaxy clusters, with a mass selection function that is remarkably uniform with redshift. In this review we provide an overview of the SZE and its use for cosmological studies, with \u2026",

The data consist of 790 deg 2 of sky observed at 150 GHz during 2008 and 2009. Here we present the power spectrum over the multipole range 650< \u2113< 3000, where it is dominated by primary CMB anisotropy. We combine this power spectrum with the power spectra from the seven-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data release to constrain cosmological models. We find that the SPT and WMAP data are consistent with each other and, when combined, are well fit by a spatially flat, \u039bCDM cosmological model. The SPT+WMAP constraint on the spectral index of scalar fluctuations is n s= 0.9663\u00b10.0112.

We quantify the statistical differences among cosmologies using both the total number and redshift distribution of clusters.

As a result, both surveys will provide improved constraints on \u03a9m and w.

The results are fully consistent with those reported using the data from the two previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the spectral index of scalar perturbations to be ns\u2004=\u20040.9649\u2005\u00b1\u20050.0042 at 68% CL.

The Universe is found to be consistent with spatial flatness with a precision of 0.4% at 95% CL by combining Planck with a compilation of baryon acoustic oscillation data.

In this Letter we present the first detection of gravitational lensing B modes, using first-season data from the polarization-sensitive receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPTpol). We construct a template for the lensing B-mode signal by combining E-mode polarization measured by SPTpol with estimates of the lensing potential from a Herschel-SPIRE map of the cosmic infrared background. We compare this template to the B modes measured directly by SPTpol, finding a nonzero correlation at 7.7 \u03c3 significance.

            "We present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum using data from the recently completed South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. This measurement is made from observations of 2540 deg 2 of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz, and improves upon previous measurements using the SPT by tripling the sky area. We report CMB temperature anisotropy power over the multipole range 650< \u2113< 3000. We fit the SPT bandpowers, combined with the 7 yr Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) data, with a six-parameter \u039bCDM cosmological model and find that the two datasets are consistent and well fit by the model. Adding SPT measurements significantly improves \u039bCDM parameter constraints; in particular, the constraint on \u03b8 s tightens by a factor of 2.7. The impact of gravitational lensing is detected at 8.1 \u03c3, the most significant \u2026",

            "The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is conducting a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect survey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxy clusters to high redshift. In this preliminary study, we focus on a 40 deg 2 area targeted by the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), which is centered roughly at right ascension 5 h 30 m, declination\u201353 (J2000). Over two seasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the SPT at 95 GHz, 150 GHz, and 225 GHz. We report the four most significant SPT detections of SZ clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and, therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an SZ survey. The SZ clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5\u03c3 significance in the high-sensitivity 150 GHz SPT map. The SZ spectrum of these sources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locations in the 95 GHz SPT \u2026",
