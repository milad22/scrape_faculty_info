A dense nanostructured network of l,l-diphenylalanine (FF) was synthesized using the solid\u2013vapor-phase technique. Formation of the nanostructures and structure\u2013phase relationship were investigated by electron microscopy and Raman scattering. Thin films of l,l-diphenylalanine micro\/nanostructures (FF-MNSs) were used as the dielectric layer in pentacene-based field-effect transistors (FETs) and metal\u2013insulator\u2013semiconductor diodes both in bottom-gate and in top-gate structures. Bias stress studies show that FF-MNS-based pentacene FETs are more resistant to degradation than pentacene FETs using FF thin film (without any nanostructures) as the dielectric layer when both are subjected to sustained \u2026",

            "Hybrid organic-inorganic photodiode interfaces have gained significant interest due to their unique physical properties such as mechanical flexibility and high photosensitivity. Two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based donor-acceptor copolymers with different backbone conformations are characterized in an inverted non-fullerene photodiode architecture using ZnO nano-patterned films as the electron transport layer. The DPP copolymer with a thienothiophene unit (PBDT-TTDPP) is more planar and rigid compared to the DPP system with a thiophene unit connecting the donor and acceptor moieties within the monomer (PBDT-TDPP). The hybrid interfaces were optimized by using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the p-type layer for monitoring the critical thickness and morphology of the ZnO layer. The maximum photoresponsivity from a P3HT:ZnO photodiode was found to be 56 mA\/W. The photoresponsivity of PBDT \u2026",

We demonstrate the effect of polarization rotation in a relaxor ferroelectric dielectric, poly (vinylidene fluoride trifluorethylene)(PVDF-TrFE), on the performance of small-molecule-based organic FETs. The subthreshold swing and other transistor parameters in organic FETs can be controlled in a reversible fashion by switching the polarization direction in the PVDF-TrFE layer.
