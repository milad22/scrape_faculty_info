            "We propose that a strongly interacting particle is a finite region of space to which fields are confined. The confinement is accomplished in a Lorentz-invariant way by endowing the finite region with a constant energy per unit volume, B. We call this finite region a\" bag.\" The contained fields may be either fermions or bosons and may have any spin; they may or may not be coupled to one another. Equations of motion and boundary conditions are obtained from a variational principle. The confining region has no dynamical freedom but constrains the fields inside: There are no excitations of the coordinates determining the confining region. The model possesses many desirable features of hadron dynamics:(i) a parton interpretation and presumably Bjorken scaling; the confined fields are free or weakly interacting except close to the boundary;(ii) infinitely rising Regge trajectories as a consequence of the bag's finite extent \u2026",

The effects of quark kinetic energy, bag energy, strange-quark mass, colored-gluon exchange in lowest order, and energy associated with certain quantum fluctuations are included. These are parameterized by four constants which have fundamental significance and do not change from multiplet to multiplet. The fit to the spectrum is good. The ordering of all the states is given correctly. The intramultiplet splittings are very accurate for the baryon decuplet and reasonably good for the other multiplets. The isosinglet pseudoscalar mesons \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 are treated separately in light of the special role that gluon intermediate states play in these states. Magnetic moments, weak decay constants, and charge radii are calculated. Where comparison with \u2026",

The bag equations for massless, Dirac fields with quark quantum numbers are solved in three space dimensions for the special case of a static spherical boundary. These solutions are quantized in an approximation which neglects zero-point fluctuations. The spectrum of lowlying baryon resonances is constructed. The only parameter of the model is fixed by the average mass of the N (938) and \u0394 (1236). The gyromagnetic ratio, axial-vector charge, and charge radius of the proton are computed and found to be 2.6, 1.09, and 1.0 fm, respectively. Refinements of the quantization procedure are discussed.",

The dynamics is based on a quark-bag model of light, colored, and permanently confined quarks gauge-coupled to non-Abelian colored gluons. The SU (6) of\" color-spin\" generated by color SU (3) and the SU (2) of relativistic j= 1 2 quarks dominates the spectrum. Color-spin rules analogous to Hund's rules of atomic spectroscopy dictate that the lightest multiquark handrons are not exotic, are of low spin, and are coupled predominantly to strange Q 3 and Q Q decay channels, Multiquark hadrons are consequently elusive and may be misclassified as conventional Q Q mesons or Q 3 baryons.",

We predict an isospin 3\/2 multiplet of \u039e\u2019s (S=\u2212 2) with J \u03a0= 1 2+ around 1750 MeV. A search for manifestly exotic \u039e+ and \u039e--in this mass range could provide a sharp test of our proposal.

We analyze several theoretical issues bearing on this result. We discuss the result expected in a variety of quark models. We examine the proposal that gluons contribute to the proton's spin in an amount calculable (in terms of gluon distribution functions) in perturbative QCD. We examine the conserved currents associated with Lorentz transformations in QCD, derive sum rules and show that the anomalous (gluonic) U(1)A current, K\u03bc, is not in general to be identified with the gluon spin. Finally, we discuss the ensemble of nucleon matrix elements of quark bilinear operators and urge an experimental and theoretical program to study them.",
