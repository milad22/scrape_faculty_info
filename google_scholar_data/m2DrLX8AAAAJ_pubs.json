            "The authors investigate the conceptualization and measurement of service quality and the relationships between service quality, consumer satisfaction, and purchase intentions. A literature review suggests that the current operationalization of service quality confounds satisfaction and attitude. Hence, the authors test (1) an alternative method of operationalizing perceived service quality and (2) the significance of the relationships between service quality, consumer satisfaction, and purchase intentions. The results suggest that (1) a performance-based measure of service quality may be an improved means of measuring the service quality construct, (2) service quality is an antecedent of consumer satisfaction, (3) consumer satisfaction has a significant effect on purchase intentions, and (4) service quality has less effect on purchase intentions than does consumer satisfaction.

            "Service quality and customer satisfaction are widely recognized as key influences in the formation of consumers' purchase intentions in service environments. However, a review of the existing literature suggests that the specific nature of the relationship between these important constructs in the determination of consumers' purchase intentions continues to elude marketing scholars (c.f. Bitner and Hubbert 1994; Bolton and Drew 1994; Gronroos 1993; Rust and Oliver 1994). The study reported here was designed to aid in the understanding of these relationships by empirically assessing the nature of the relationship between service quality and consumer satisfaction in the formation of consumers' purchase intentions across four unique service industries. The results of the current research, coupled with the weight of the evidence in the emerging services literature, suggest that consumer satisfaction is best described \u2026",
