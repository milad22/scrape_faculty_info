            "Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability\u2014in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the \u2018chicken and egg problem\u2019. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like \u2026",

We show that the stripe magnetic order is generally preempted by an Ising-nematic order, which breaks C 4 lattice symmetry but preserves O (3) spin-rotational symmetry. This leads to a rich phase diagram as function of doping, pressure, and elastic moduli, displaying split magnetic and nematic tricritical points. The nematic transition may instantly bring the system to the verge of a magnetic transition, or it may occur first, being followed by a magnetic transition at a lower temperature. In the latter case, the preemptive nematic transition is accompanied by either a jump or a rapid increase of the magnetic correlation length, triggering a pseudogap behavior associated with magnetic precursors.

To this end we demonstrate that the itinerant antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and the unconventional s+\u2212 sign-changing superconducting (SC) state are near the borderline of microscopic coexistence and macroscopic phase separation, explaining the experimentally observed competition of both ordered states. In contrast, conventional s++ pairing is not able to coexist with magnetism. Expanding the microscopic free energy of the system with competing orders around the multicritical point, we find that static magnetism plays the role of an intrinsic interband Josephson coupling, making the phase diagram sensitive to the symmetry of the Cooper-pair wave function. We relate this result to the quasiparticle excitation spectrum and to the emergent SO (5) symmetry of systems with \u2026",
