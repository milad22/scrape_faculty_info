We find that the tail evolves to a nearly time stationary structure about one solar wind transit time after the IMF turns northward. Four regions of different magnetic topology can be distinguished which extend at least to the end of the simulation box at 400 RE. Besides lobe field lines and open solar wind field lines tailward of an X\u2010line, there is a broad boundary layer of closed field lines which we call the tail flank boundary layer (TFBL). Just inside the TFBL there is a region of closed field loops. Besides the X\u2010line we find two O\u2010lines which are enclosed by the closed field loops and are roughly aligned with the tail axis.

During the first seven months of the mission the five satellites coasted near their injection orbit to avoid differential precession in anticipation of orbit placement, which started in September 2007 and led to a commencement of the baseline mission in December 2007. During the coast phase the probes were put into a string-of-pearls configuration at 100 s of km to 2 RE along-track separations, which provided a unique view of the magnetosphere and enabled an unprecedented dataset in anticipation of the first tail season.

We find that: (i) The model produces essentially all observational features expected for FTEs, in particular the bipolar signature of the magnetic field BN component, the correct polarity, duration, and intermittency of that bipolar signature, strong core fields and enhanced core pressure, and flow enhancements; (ii) FTEs only develop for large dipole tilt whereas in the case of no dipole tilt steady magnetic reconnection occurs at the dayside magnetopause; (iii) the basic process by which FTEs are produced is the sequential generation of new X-lines which makes dayside reconnection inherently time dependent and leads to a modified form of dual or multiple X-line reconnection; (iv) the FTE generation process in this model is not dependent on specific assumptions about microscopic processes; (v) the average period of FTEs can be explained by simple geometric arguments involving magnetosheath convection; (vi) FTEs do not develop in the model if the numerical resolution is too coarse leading to too much numerical diffusion; and (vii) FTEs for nearly southward IMF and large dipole tilt, i.e., near solstice, should only develop in the winter hemisphere, which provides a testable prediction of seasonal modulation. The semiannual modulation of intermittent FTE reconnection versus steady reconnection is also expected to modulate magnetospheric and ionospheric convection and may thus contribute to the semiannual variation \u2026",

After the southward IMF reaches the dayside magnetopause reconnection begins and magnetic flux is convected into the tail lobes. After about 35 min, reconnection begins within the plasma sheet near midnight at x = \u221214RE. Later the x line moves toward dawn and dusk. The reconnection occurs just tailward of the region where the tail attaches onto the dipole\u2010dominated inner magnetosphere. The simulation shows that prior to the onset of reconnection, the Poynting flux is concentrated in this region. The time required for the start of reconnection depends on the component of the magnetic field normal to the equator (BZ).

            "We compare four explanations of transpolar potential saturation: (1) the magnetic field at the stagnation point weakens, thereby limiting magnetic reconnection; (2) a dimple develops at the stagnation point, which limits the inflow rate to the reconnection line; (3) the magnetopause becomes blunt and the bow shock recedes, thus giving more room for the solar wind to flow around the magnetosphere, thereby reducing the need for magnetic reconnection; (4) the region 1 current system usurps the Chapman\u2010Ferraro current system and saturates when the J \u00d7 B force it generates balances solar wind ram pressure. The paper's point is that all four mechanisms involve a limit on the strength of the region 1 current system and that the criterion for the onset of transpolar potential saturation in each mechanism is that the region 1 current system generates a magnetic field that is about as strong as the dipole field at the dayside \u2026",

During that period, the Wind satellite monitored the solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) upstream of the bow shock. The IMF was northward and the plasma parameters near average. Geotail observed slow tailward flows and a northward field. The plasma and field parameters indicate that Geotail is either in the plasma sheet or in a boundary layer. We used the Wind solar wind plasma and IMF data as input for a global simulation of that time interval. Comparison of the simulation results with the observational data show very good overall agreement of the magnitudes of the plasma and field parameters. In particular, the simulation reproduces the slow tailward flows and northward field found at Geotail. Small scale temporal variations are \u2026",
