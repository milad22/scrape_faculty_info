We pinpoint the event to the center of a small, star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. Its high-energy emission has lasted much longer than any \u03b3-ray burst, whereas its peak luminosity was \u223c100 times higher than bright active galactic nuclei.

Their average ratio M halo\/M stars has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5\u00d7 10 10 solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses 1, 2. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies 3, 4.

We present new methods for quantifying the specific angular momentum j, focusing mainly on the more challenging case of early-type galaxies, in order to derive firm empirical relations between stellar j sstarf and mass M sstarf (thus extending earlier work by Fall). We carry out detailed analyses of eight galaxies with kinematical data extending as far out as 10 effective radii, and find that data at two effective radii are generally sufficient to estimate total j sstarf reliably. Our results contravene suggestions that ellipticals could harbor large reservoirs of hidden j sstarf in their outer regions owing to angular momentum transport in major mergers.
