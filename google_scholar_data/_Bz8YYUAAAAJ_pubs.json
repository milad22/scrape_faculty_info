            "The properties of small particles can be markedly different from the bulk. A classical thermodynamic treatment of the melting and freezing of small particles, including the effects of surface-induced order, predicts an energy barrier between a surface melted state and the liquid droplet. The requirement of homogeneous nucleation over the barrier on laboratory time scales predicts melting and freezing temperatures that vary from the bulk temperatures and from each other. For very small particles the energy barrier is so small that the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. However, above a few nanometers in radius the melting and freezing temperatures are different. This approach also predicts a low temperature region where a disordered particle would stay disordered for extended periods of time. This model only applies to the situation where the melt wets the solid.",

            "A class of carbon-nanotube (CNT) composite materials was developed to take advantage of the precise high-aspect-ratio shape of patterned vertically grown nanotube forests. These patterned forests were rendered mechanically robust by chemical vapor infiltration and released by etching an underlying sacrificial layer. We fabricated a diverse variety of functional MEMS devices, including cantilevers, bistable mechanisms, and thermomechanical actuators, using this technique. A wide range of chemical-vapor-depositable materials could be used as fillers; here, we specifically explored infiltration by silicon and silicon nitride. The CNT framework technique may enable high-aspect-ratio MEMS fabrication from a variety of materials with desired properties such as high-temperature stability or robustness. The elastic modulus of the silicon-nanotube and silicon nitride-nanotube composites is dominated by the filler \u2026",

Partial chemical infiltration of 3D carbon\u2010nanotube structures with silicon results in a mechanically robust material, structured from the 10 nm scale to the 100 \u03bcm scale. The nanoscale dimensions are determined by the diameter and spacing of the resulting silicon\/carbon nanotubes, while the microscale dimensions are controlled by the lithographic patterning of the CNT growth catalyst. We demonstrate the utility of this hierarchical structuring approach by using CNT\u2010M to fabricate thin\u2010layer\u2010chromatography (TLC) separations media with precise microscale channels for fluid\u2010flow control and nanoscale porosity for high analyte capacity.
