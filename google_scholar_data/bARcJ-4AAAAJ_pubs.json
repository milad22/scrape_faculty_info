            "We explore the analytic structure of the gluon and quark propagators of Landau gauge QCD from numerical solutions of the coupled system of renormalized Dyson-Schwinger equations and from fits to lattice data. We find sizable negative norm contributions in the transverse gluon propagator indicating the absence of the transverse gluon from the physical spectrum. A simple analytic structure for the gluon propagator is proposed. For the quark propagator we find evidence for a masslike singularity on the real timelike momentum axis, with a mass of 350 to 500 MeV. Within the Green\u2019s function approach that is employed, we identify a crucial term in the quark-gluon vertex that leads to a positive definite Schwinger function for the quark propagator.",

We propose a simple extrapolation formula for the moments of the nonsinglet quark distribution u\u2212 d, as a function of quark mass, which embodies the general constraints imposed by the chiral symmetry of QCD. The inclusion of the leading nonanalytic behavior leads to an excellent description of both the lattice data and the experimental values of the moments.",
