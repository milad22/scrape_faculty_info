The charge carrier density is as high as 2\u00d7 10 9 cm\u2212 3, and the temperatures of electrons and ions are as low as 100 mK and 10 \u03bc K, respectively. Plasma behavior is evident in the trapping of electrons by the positive ion cloud when the Debye screening length becomes smaller than the size of the sample. We produce plasmas with parameters such that both electrons and ions are strongly coupled.",

The computer determines the positions of all of the peaks in the scan, and generates output signals to control the laser frequencies. It also provides a visual display of cavity spectra.

            "Detection of a single photon escaping an optical cavity QED system prepares a nonclassical state of the electromagnetic field. The evolution of the state can be modified by changing the drive of the cavity. For the appropriate feedback, the conditional state can be captured (stabilized) and then released. This is observed by a conditional intensity measurement that shows suppression of vacuum Rabi oscillations for the length of the feedback pulse and their subsequent return.",

We use a time-correlated single-photon counting technique on a cold sample of 210 Fr atoms in a magneto-optic trap. We excite the atoms with the trapping and repumping beams of the magneto-optic trap and detect the decay of the atomic fluorescence. The results are a precision experimental test of the atomic many-body perturbation theory applied to the heaviest alkali metal. The lifetime results are 21.02 (11) ns and 29.45 (11) ns for the 7 p 2 P 3\/2 and 7 p 2 P 1\/2 levels, respectively. This gives a line strength ratio S 1\/2\/S 3\/2 of 0.526 (3) for these levels in Fr. To study sources of systematic errors we measure the lifetimes of 5 p 2 P 3\/2 and 5 p 2 P 1\/2 in stable 87 Rb and obtain 26.20 (9) ns and 27.64 (4) ns, respectively.",

The atomic medium approximates a system of homogeneously broadened\" two-level\" atoms, and effects due to standing waves are eliminated. The experiment thus represents the first demonstration of optical bistability under conditions that have been widely employed in theoretical models. Absolute measurements of switching intensities versus atomic cooperativity C are reported, and a preliminary comparison with Gaussian-beam theory is made.",
