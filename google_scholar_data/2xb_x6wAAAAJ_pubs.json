            "We present a formalism for analyzing a full-sky temperature and polarization map of the cosmic microwave background. Temperature maps are analyzed by expanding over the set of spherical harmonics to give multipole moments of the two-point correlation function. Polarization, which is described by a second-rank tensor, can be treated analogously by expanding in the appropriate tensor spherical harmonics. We provide expressions for the complete set of temperature and polarization multipole moments for scalar and tensor metric perturbations. Four sets of multipole moments completely describe isotropic temperature and polarization correlations; for scalar metric perturbations one set is identically zero, giving the possibility of a clean determination of the vector and tensor contributions. The variance with which the multipole moments can be measured in idealized experiments is evaluated, including the effects \u2026",

We review the imprint of each parameter on the CMB. Assuming only that the primordial perturbations were adiabatic, we use a covariance-matrix approach to estimate the precision with which these parameters can be determined by a CMB temperature map as a function of the fraction of sky mapped, the level of pixel noise, and the angular resolution. For example, with no prior information about any of the cosmological parameters, a full-sky CMB map with 0.5 angular resolution and a noise level of 15 \u03bcK \u2026",

First we discuss the fluid mechanics of relativistic spherical combustion. We then numerically collide many bubbles expanding at a velocity v and calculate the resulting spectrum of gravitational radiation in the linearized gravity approximation. Our results are expressed as simple functions of the mean bubble separation, the bubble expansion velocity, the latent heat, and the efficiency of converting latent heat to kinetic energy of the bubble walls. A first-order phase transition is also likely to excite a Kolmogoroff spectrum of turbulence. We estimate the gravity waves produced by such a spectrum of turbulence and find that the characteristic amplitude of the gravity waves produced is comparable to that from bubble collisions.

            "We present constraints on cosmological and astrophysical parameters from high-resolution microwave background maps at 148 GHz and 218 GHz made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in three seasons of observations from 2008 to 2010. A model of primary cosmological and secondary foreground parameters is fit to the map power spectra and lensing deflection power spectrum, including contributions from both the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, Poisson and correlated anisotropy from unresolved infrared sources, radio sources, and the correlation between the tSZ effect and infrared sources. The power \u2113 2 C \u2113\/2\u03c0 of the thermal SZ power spectrum at 148 GHz is measured to be 3.4\u00b11.4 \u03bcK 2 at \u2113= 3000, while the corresponding amplitude of the kinematic SZ power spectrum has a 95% confidence level upper limit of 8.6 \u03bcK 2.

            "In the linearized-gravity approximation we numerically compute the amount of gravitational radiation produced by the collision of two true-vacuum bubbles in Minkowski space. The bubbles are separated by distance d and we calculate the amount of gravitational radiation that is produced in a time \u03c4\u223c d (in a cosmological phase transition \u03c4 corresponds to the duration of the transition, which is expected to be of the order of the mean bubble separation d). Our approximations are generally valid for \u03c4\u2272 H\u2212 1. We find that the amount of gravitational radiation produced depends only upon the grossest features of the collision: the time \u03c4 and the energy density associated with the false-vacuum state, \u03c1 vac. In particular, the spectrum dE GW\/d\u03c9\u221d \u03c1 vac 2 \u03c4 6 and peaks at a characteristic frequency \u03c9 max\u2243 3.8\/\u03c4, and the fraction of the vacuum energy released into gravitational waves is about 1.3\u00d7 10\u2212 3 (\u03c4\/H\u2212 1) 2, where H 2 \u2026",

            "We report on 23 clusters detected blindly as Sunyaev-ZEL'DOVICH (SZ) decrements in a 148 GHz, 455 deg 2 map of the southern sky made with data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope 2008 observing season. All SZ detections announced in this work have confirmed optical counterparts. Ten of the clusters are new discoveries. One newly discovered cluster, ACT-CL J0102\u20134915, with a redshift of 0.75 (photometric), has an SZ decrement comparable to the most massive systems at lower redshifts. Simulations of the cluster recovery method reproduce the sample purity measured by optical follow-up. In particular, for clusters detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than six, simulations are consistent with optical follow-up that demonstrated this subsample is 100% pure. The simulations further imply that the total sample is 80% complete for clusters with mass in excess of 6\u00d7 10 14 solar masses referenced to \u2026",
