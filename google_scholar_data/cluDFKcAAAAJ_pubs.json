            "EEG oscillations are hypothesized to reflect cyclical variations in the neuronal excitability, with particular frequency bands reflecting differing spatial scales of brain operation. However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1\u20134 Hz) phase modulates theta (4\u201310 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30\u201350 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient \u2026",

Single-trial ERP recordings capture the oscillatory activity that are hypothesized to underlie both communication between brain regions and amplified processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, precise interpretations of ERPs are precluded by uncertainty about their neural mechanisms. One influential theory holds that averaged sensory ERPs are generated by partial phase resetting of ongoing electroencephalographic oscillations, while another states that ERPs result from stimulus-evoked neural responses. We formulated critical predictions of each theory and tested these using direct, intracortical analyses of neural activity in monkeys.

In this paper, we demonstrate that more realistic models, incorporating amplitude and latency variability of the evoked response itself, can explain statistical properties of cortical potentials that have often been attributed to stimulus-related changes in functional connectivity or other intrinsic neural parameters.Methods: Implications of trial-to-trial evoked potential variability for variance, power spectrum, and interdependence measures like cross-correlation and spectral coherence, are first derived analytically. These implications are then illustrated using model simulations and verified experimentally by the analysis of intracortical local field \u2026",

We then further demonstrate the power of the Bayesian approach by deriving two separation algorithms that incorporate additional prior information. One algorithm separates signals that are known a priori to be decorrelated and the other utilizes information about the signal propagation through the medium from the sources to the detectors.",
