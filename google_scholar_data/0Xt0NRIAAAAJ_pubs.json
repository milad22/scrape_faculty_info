            "The construction of thousands of well-defined, porous, metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) structures, spanning a broad range of topologies and an even broader range of pore sizes and chemical functionalities, has fuelled the exploration of many applications. Accompanying this applied focus has been a recognition of the need to engender MOFs with mechanical, thermal and\/or chemical stability. Chemical stability in acidic, basic and neutral aqueous solutions is important. Advances over recent years have made it possible to design MOFs that possess different combinations of mechanical, thermal and chemical stability. Here, we review these advances and the associated design principles and synthesis strategies. We focus on how these advances may render MOFs effective as heterogeneous catalysts, both in chemically harsh condensed phases and in thermally challenging conditions relevant to gas-phase \u2026",

            "Uncontrolled massive release of the primary greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) into atmosphere from anthropogenic activities poses a big threat and adversely affects our global climate and natural environment. One promising approach to mitigate CO2 emission is carbon capture and storage (CCS), in which ideal adsorbent materials with high storage capacity and excellent adsorption selectivity over other gases are urgently needed. For practical applications in CO2 capture from flue gas of power plants, the biggest single contributor of anthropogenic CO2 emission, the adsorbent materials must also be chemically stable, be easy to regenerate with minimal energy input, and be easily synthesized with low capital cost. Metal\u2010organic frameworks (MOFs), highly crystalline porous materials constructed by metal ions and organic ligands, have emerged as a class of excellent adsorbent materials for carbon capture \u2026",

In particular, the highly atom-economical acid-catalyzed cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to yield cyclic organic carbonates (OCs), a functionality having many important industrial applications, is an attractive reaction for the utilization of CO2 as a chemical feedstock. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates in catalysis as they are a class of crystalline, porous and functional materials with remarkable properties including great surface area, high stability, open channels and permanent porosity. MOFs structure tunability and their affinity for CO2, makes them great catalysts for the formation of OCs using CO2 and epoxides. In this review, we examine MOF-based catalytic materials for the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to epoxides. Catalysts are grouped based on the location of catalytic sites, i.e., at the struts, nodes, defect sites, or some combination thereof. Additionally, important features of each catalyst system are critically discussed.",

Considering the importance of efficiency and safety in this process, catalytic degradation is a viable approach for fast and complete detoxification of CWAs. To date, a variety of catalysts have been discovered to be active for the degradation of nerve agents and sulfur mustard. Among the most promising are a class of porous functional materials named metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In the past few years, tremendous progress has been made in this field including the discovery of zirconium MOF catalysts for fast nerve agent hydrolysis.
