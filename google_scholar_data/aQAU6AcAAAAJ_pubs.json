            "Ultrafast optical spectroscopy methods, such as transient absorption spectroscopy and 2D spectroscopy, are widely used across many disciplines. However, these techniques are typically restricted to optically thick samples, such as solids and liquid solutions. Using a frequency comb laser and optical cavities, we present a technique for performing ultrafast optical spectroscopy with high sensitivity, enabling work in dilute gas-phase molecular beams. Resonantly enhancing the probe pulses, we demonstrate transient absorption measurements with a detection limit of \u0394OD=2\u00d710^\u221210 (1\u00d710^\u22129\/Hz). Resonantly enhancing the pump pulses allows us to produce a high excitation fraction at a high repetition rate, so that signals can be recorded from samples with optical densities as low as OD\u224810^\u22128, or column densities <10^10\u2009\u2009molecules\/cm^2. To our knowledge, this represents a 5000-fold improvement of the state \u2026",

Detailed spectral assignments and least squares fits to an A-reduction Watson asymmetric top Hamiltonian yield rotational constants and vibrational origins for three A-type bands, assigned to single quantum excitation of the symmetric CH2 stretch. Two of the observed bands arise definitively from ground state vinyl radical, as rigorously confirmed by combination differences predicted from previous midinfrared CH2 wagging studies of Kanamori et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 92, 197 (1990)] as well as millimeter wave rotation-tunneling studies of Tanaka et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 120, 3604 (2004)]. The two bands reflect transitions out of symmetric (0+) and antisymmetric (0\u2212) tunneling levels of vinyl radical populated at 14K slit-jet expansion temperatures.

We discuss two such laser systems: an 87 MHz, 9 W, 85 fs laser operating at 1060 nm and an 87 MHz, 80 W, 155 fs laser operating at 1035 nm. Both are constructed using low-cost, commercially available components, and can be assembled using only basic tools for cleaving and splicing single-mode fibers. We describe practical methods for achieving and characterizing low-noise single-pulse operation and long-term stability from Yb:fiber oscillators based on nonlinear polarization evolution. Stabilization of the combs using a variety of transducers, including a new method for tuning the carrier-envelope offset frequency, is discussed. High average power is achieved through chirped-pulse amplification in simple fiber amplifiers based on double-clad \u2026",

The combination of (i) slit-jet cooling (Trot \u2248 12 K) and (ii) sub-Doppler resolution (\u2248 60 MHz) permits satellite branches in each 2\u03a0\u20132\u03a3+ band to be observed and resolved for the first time as well as help clarify a systematic parity misassignment from previous studies. The observed lines in each band are least squares fit to a Hamiltonian model containing rotational, spin-rotational, spin-orbit, and lambda-doubling contributions for the 2\u03a0 state, from which we report revised excited state constants and band origins for the observed bands. Three of the four bands fit extremely well within a conventional 2\u03a0 model (i.e., \u03c3 < 20 MHz), while one band exhibits a local perturbation due to an avoided crossing with a near resonant dark state.

The observed A-type band arises from fundamental excitation of the out-of-phase symmetric CH stretch mode (\u03bd19) of b2 symmetry. Unambiguous spectral assignment of the rotational structure to the phenyl radical is facilitated by comparison with precision 2-line combination differences from Fourier transform microwave and direct absorption mm-wave measurements on the ground state [R. J. McMahon et al., Astrophys. J., 2003, 590, L61]. Least-squares fits to an asymmetric top Hamiltonian permit the upper-state rotational constants to be obtained. The corresponding gas-phase vibrational band origin at 3071.8904 (10) cm\u22121 is in remarkably good agreement with previous matrix isolation studies [A. V. Friderichsen et al., J. Am. Chem.
