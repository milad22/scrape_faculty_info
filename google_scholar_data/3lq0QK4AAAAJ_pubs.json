            "Shortly after the seminal paper \u201cSelf-Organized Criticality: An explanation of 1\/f noise\u201d by Bak et al. (1987), the idea has been applied to solar physics, in \u201cAvalanches and the Distribution of Solar Flares\u201d by Lu and Hamilton (1991). In the following years, an inspiring cross-fertilization from complexity theory to solar and astrophysics took place, where the SOC concept was initially applied to solar flares, stellar flares, and magnetospheric substorms, and later extended to the radiation belt, the heliosphere, lunar craters, the asteroid belt, the Saturn ring, pulsar glitches, soft X-ray repeaters, blazars, black-hole objects, cosmic rays, and boson clouds. The application of SOC concepts has been performed by numerical cellular automaton simulations, by analytical calculations of statistical (powerlaw-like) distributions based on physical scaling laws, and by observational tests of theoretically predicted \u2026",

Approximately 12,300 individual emission events near local midnight with durations exceeding the sampling time of the image sequences are investigated. The probability distributions of these events over the lifetime T, maximum area A, integrated area S, maximum power W, and integrated energy output are shown to obey distinct power law relations p \u223c T\u22122.2, p \u223c A\u22121.8, p \u223c S\u22121.6, p \u223c W\u22121.7, p \u223c E\u22121.5 over a wide range of scales. The observed behavior is consistent with the behavior of statistical\u2013physical avalanche models near a stationary critical state. These results support the hypothesis of self\u2010organized critical dynamics of the magnetosphere and suggest an important role for cross\u2010scale coupling effects \u2026",

The effect of self-organized criticality (SOC) is proposed as an internal mechanism to generate 1\/f b  fluctuations in the magnetosphere.

            "[1] Several series of large dipolarization events are documented from magnetic field observations in Mercury's magnetotail made by the MESSENGER spacecraft. The dipolarizations are identified by a rapid (\u223c 1 s) increase in the northward component of the magnetic field, followed by a slower return (\u223c 10 s) to pre\u2010onset values. The changes in field strength during an event frequently reach 40 nT or higher, equivalent to an increase in the total magnetic field magnitude by a factor of\u223c 4 or more. The presence of spatially constrained dipolarizations at Mercury provides a key to understanding the magnetic substorm process in a new parameter regime: the dipolarization timescale, which is shorter than at Earth, is suspected to lead to efficient non\u2010adiabatic heating of the plasma sheet proton population, and the high recurrence rate of the structures is similar to that frequently observed for flux ropes and traveling \u2026",

We show that the ensemble average dynamics of the activity bursts in the AE index is essentially scale\u2010free and can be characterized in terms of spreading critical exponents \u03b7 and \u03b4. The lifetime T and the size S of the bursts show strong algebraic correlation that is approximated by the dependence S \u223c T1+\u03b7+\u03b4.

These distributions almost certainly reflect the dynamics of the plasma sheet. A scale\u2010free avalanching process involving reconnection and\/or current diversion over an exceptionally broad range of spatiotemporal scales is implied. The most straightforward, and at present sole, explanation for this behavior is that the plasma sheet dynamics is in the neighborhood of self\u2010organized criticality (SOC).

The results support our previous theoretical conclusions that the restoring force of large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations is solar gravity, and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Based on our previous work, we used the fitted parameters to determine the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic field along the filament, as well as the mass accretion rate onto the filament threads.

            "We present the first systematic observational evidence for a traveling periodic structure in the pre\u2010onset optical aurora \u2013 the longitudinally propagating arc wave (LPAW) \u2013 associated with flapping oscillations in the magnetotail. The LPAW is characterized by azimuthally moving intensity enhancements inside auroral arcs as seen by THEMIS ground\u2010based all\u2010sky imagers. It travels westward in the pre\u2010midnight auroral sector during the 10\u201320 minutes preceding auroral breakup with a velocity of 2\u201310 km\/s, time period 40\u2013110 s, and wavelength 250\u2013420 km. Magnetically conjugate measurements by THEMIS satellites show low frequency plasma oscillations consistent with the parameters of the arc wave in the course of current sheet thinning. When mapped into tail, wavelength (4800\u20139400 km) and velocity (70\u2013190 km\/s) of the LPAW are compatible with observations and theoretical predictions for current sheet \u2026",
