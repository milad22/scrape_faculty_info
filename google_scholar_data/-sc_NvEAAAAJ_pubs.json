            "We have observed many focal dilatations or very small aneurysms in terminal arterioles and capillaries of 4 of 5 patients and 6 dogs who had recently undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. A smaller number of sausagelike dilatations distended medium\u2010sized arterioles. Two other patients had a small number of the same microvascular changes following proximal aortography. Thirty\u2010four patients and 6 dogs not undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass had none. (A 35th patient who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass or aortography showed a small number of dilatations; mediastinal air was a suggested source.) Some of the dilatations exhibited various forms of birefringence. Because most of the dilatations appear empty, we speculate that they are the sites of gas bubbles or fat emboli that have been removed by the solvents used in processing.

            "It has recently been demonstrated that myocardial ischemia and reperfusion results in a marked decrease in the release of nitric oxide (NO) by the coronary endothelium. NO may possess cardioprotective properties, possibly related to inhibition of neutrophil-related activities. We tested the hypothesis that a cysteine-containing nitric oxide donor compound, SPM-5185, would reduce infarct size and inhibit neutrophil-related activities (adherence to coronary vascular endothelium, accumulation).The effects of intracoronary infusion of SPM-5185 were investigated in a 5.5-hour model of myocardial ischemia (1 hour) and reperfusion (4.5 hours) (MI-R) in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. SPM-5185 (500 nmol\/L) or saline vehicle was infused for 4.5 hours into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) at the time of reperfusion after 1 hour of LAD occlusion.

Open-chest, anesthetized dogs underwent 60 min of left anterior descending coronary arterial (LAD) occlusion followed by 270 min of reperfusion. Dogs received intracoronary 10 mM L-Arg (n = 9 dogs), intracoronary 10 mM D-arginine (D-Arg, n = 7), or saline vehicle (Veh, n = 10) in the LAD during the first 120 min of reperfusion using an extracorporeal system.

            "Left ventricular dimensions determined by echocardiography in 21 patients were compared by linear regression analysis to biplane angiographic measurements. The results showed significant correlations between the end-diastolic diameter, wall thickness and dimensional ejection fraction obtained by ultrasound and by angiography. The left ventricular volumes derived by the area-length method related closely to the echocardiographic volumes at end-diastole and end-systole. Angiographic stroke volumes showed high correlations with the volumetric change during the cardiac cycle. Determinations of left ventricular mass by echocardiography proved to correlate well with those derived from angiocardiograms. However, satisfactory ultrasonic examinations could not be obtained from 6 (22 percent) of the patient group, who had pulmonary emphysema, cardiomegaly or an exceptionally thick anterior chest wall \u2026",

            "The prognostic value of preoperative symptoms, preoperative left ventricular function, and intraoperative factors as related to postoperative outcome in coronary artery bypass grafting is unclear. This study was performed to identify risk factors that could be used as markers to predict immediate and long-term outcome, knowledge of which might allow physicians to modify these factors to decrease the likelihood of an adverse outcome. We retrospectively evaluated preoperative factors (including age, sex, New York Heart Association [NYHA] classification of symptoms, ejection fraction [EF], wall motion abnormalities, baseline left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [LVEDP], postradiographic contrast injection LVEDP, change in LVEDP with contrast injection, cardiac enlargement, and collateral vessels) and intraoperative factors (duration of bypass and aortic cross-clamp time) in 128 patients. The need for inotropic drug support was used as a marker of immediate outcome. A 36-mo follow-up used death and the postoperative NYHA classification of symptoms as markers of long-term outcome. The various factors associated with the use of inotropes and immediate outcome were analyzed by logistic regression. The factors related to inotrope use (and presumed adverse short-term outcome) in order of decreasing significance were lower EF, older age, cardiac enlargement, female sex, and higher baseline and postcontrast LVEDP. Patients with EF greater than or equal to 55%, but also having wall motion abnormalities and LVEDP change greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, and all patients with EF less than 55% were more likely to require inotropic drug \u2026",

The effect of restoring aortic pressure on visceral organ, brain, and femoral muscle perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass by increasing pump flow or infusing phenylephrine was examined.Methods. Twelve anesthetized swine were stabilized on normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. After baseline measurements, including regional blood flow (radioactive microspheres), aortic pressure was reduced to 40 mm Hg by decreasing the pump flow. Next, aortic pressure was restored to 65 mm Hg either by increasing the pump flow or by titrating phenylephrine. The animals had both interventions in random order.Results. At 40 mm Hg aortic pressure, perfusion to all visceral organs and femoral muscle, but not to the brain, was significantly reduced. Increasing pump flow improved perfusion to the \u2026",

            "A mathematical model describing the dynamic interaction between the left and the right ventricle over the complete cardiac cycle is presented. The pericardium-bound left and right ventricles are represented as two coupled chambers consisting of the left and right free walls and the interventricular septum. Time-varying pressure-volume relationships characterize the component compliances, and the interaction of these components produces the globally observed ventricular pump properties (total chamber pressure and volume). The model 1) permits the simulation of passive (diastolic) and active (systolic) ventricular interaction, 2) provides temporal profiles of hemodynamic variables (e.g., ventricular pressures, volumes, and flow) that agree well with reported observations, and 3) can be used to examine the effect of the pericardium on ventricular interaction and ventricular mechanics.
