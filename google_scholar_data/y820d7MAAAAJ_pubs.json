            "Using numerical self-consistent field (SCF) calculations, we investigate the interactions between two closely spaced surfaces and the surrounding polymer melt. Short chains (surfactants) are terminally anchored to each of the surfaces. The coated substrates model organically modified clay crystallites (sheets). Through the calculations, we vary the characteristics of the surfactants and polymers to isolate conditions that drive the polymer to penetrate the gap between the surfaces. We also consider the effect of employing end-functionalized chains to promote the dispersion of bare clay sheets within the polymer matrix. We find that this scheme provides a robust method for exfoliating the sheets. To consider this case in greater depth, we develop an analytical SCF theory to model the interactions among the functionalized chains, nonfunctionalized polymers, and the clay sheets.

Our analysis is based upon a test administered to 89 students from six universities and interviews with 9 students. Strikingly, most students shared the same difficulties despite variations in background, teaching styles, and textbooks. Concepts related to stationary states, eigenstates, and time dependence of expectation values were found to be particularly difficult. An analysis of written tests and interviews suggests that widespread misconceptions originate from an inability to discriminate between related concepts and a tendency to overgeneralize.",

We also conducted one-on-one interviews with fifteen graduate or advanced undergraduate students who had just completed a course in which all the content on the survey was covered. Although students from some universities performed better on average than others, we found that students share universal difficulties understanding the concepts of quantum mechanics. The difficulties were often due to overgeneralizations of concepts learned in one context to other contexts where they are not directly applicable. Difficulties in distinguishing between closely related concepts and making sense of the formalism of quantum \u2026",

            "We analyze the problem-solving strategies of physics professors in a case where their physical intuition fails. A nonintuitive introductory-level problem was identified and posed to twenty physics professors. The problem placed the professors in a situation often encountered by students, and their response highlights the importance of intuition and experience in problem solving. Although professors had difficulty in solving the problem under the time constraint, they initially employed a systematic approach, for example, visualizing the problem, considering various conservation laws, and examining limiting cases. After finding that familiar techniques were not fruitful, they made incorrect predictions based on one of two equally important factors. In contrast, other more familiar problems that require the consideration of two important principles (for example, conservation of both energy and momentum for a ballistic \u2026",
