The driving force for such vertically self-organized growth is shown to be the interacting strain fields induced by the islands which give rise to a preferred direction for In migration. A model analysis accounting for the mechanochemical surface diffusion gives an island average size and average separation dependent characteristic spacer layer thickness z 0 below which a vertically self-organized growth occurs.",

Such plasmas can be realized in semiconductor heterojunctions, superlattices, and inversion or accumulation layers. In general two modes are found to exist: the one with energy proportional to q at long wavelengths is the usual optical plasmon and the other with energy proportional to q at long wavelengths is the acoustic plasmon. It is shown that the spatial separation between the two charge components makes it possible for the acoustic branch to move out of the electron-hole continua of both the components provided it exceeds a critical value. Consequently the acoustic-plasmon mode is totally undamped at long wavelength. The dynamic structure factor of the system is analyzed and the feasibility of observing an acoustic plasmon in GaAs-Ga x Al \u2026",

            "Excited states and energy relaxation processes are studied for stacked InAs\/GaAs QD\u2019s with GaAs cap layers grown by migration enhanced epitaxy. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra reveal the excited state spectrum as a function of size for self-assembled InAs QD\u2019s in multilayered samples with 36-ML spacers. The observed energy shifts and splittings are consistent with those of hole states numerically calculated for pyramidal QD\u2019s supporting assignment to the transition between the electron ground| 000> and the| 001> excited hole state. The optical results suggest the island shape uniformity to improve in multilayered samples, which is attributed to the contribution of the buried islands to the surface strain altering the island formation kinetics and energetics that also underlie vertical self-organization. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results yield a lifetime of 40 ps for the first excited| 001> hole \u2026",

An unexpectedly enhanced polar exciton-LO-phonon interaction for such strained low-symmetry QDs is found. Calculations in the adiabatic approximation indicate that the particular quantum confinement and piezoelectric effect together account for the enhanced coupling.

Remarkably, just after the initiation of well\u2010formed 3D islands at \u223c1.57 ML InAs deposition, the lateral size dispersion and average value are found to first increase drastically with the smallest amount (\u223c0.05 ML) of additional InAs deposition and then decrease and saturate, indicating the onset of a natural tendency for size equalization, including through loss of material from the initially formed largest islands. These observations are found to be consistent with the previously suggested island\u2010separation dependent influence of the evolving island\u2010induced substrate strain fields on the adatom migration and incorporation\/detachment kinetics that control the evolution of the islands.",

Transmission electron microscope studies reveal the presence of strain dominated atom migration away from the islands over dynamically evolving length scales of \u223c100\u2013400 \u00c5 at higher growth temperature whereas at lower growth temperature such an effect is minimal. Anisotropy in the length scale of impact between the [011] and [011\u0304] directions is observed. Estimates based upon a suitably adapted formulation of the classical theory of grain growth shows the mass transport to be dominantly strain rather than surface curvature driven.",
