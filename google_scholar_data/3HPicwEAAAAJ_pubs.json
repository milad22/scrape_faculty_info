This model eliminates the need for a nonzero cosmological constant or any other form of dark energy, attributing a purely gravitational origin to the acceleration of the universe.",

            "Models of dark energy are conveniently characterized by the equation-of-state parameter w= p\/\u03c1, where \u03c1 is the energy density and p is the pressure. Imposing the dominant energy condition, which guarantees stability of the theory, implies that w>~\u2212 1. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a well-defined model could (perhaps temporarily) have w<\u2212 1, and indeed such models have been proposed. We study the stability of dynamical models exhibiting w<\u2212 1 by virtue of a negative kinetic term. Although naively unstable, we explore the possibility that these models might be phenomenologically viable if thought of as effective field theories valid only up to a certain momentum cutoff. Under our most optimistic assumptions, we argue that the instability time scale can be greater than the age of the universe, but only if the cutoff is at or below 10\u2212 3 eV. We conclude that it is difficult, although not necessarily impossible, to \u2026",

            "After a decade and a half of research motivated by the accelerating universe, theory and experiment have reached a certain level of maturity. The development of theoretical models beyond \u039b or smooth dark energy, often called modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a host of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this review we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for anticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding principles for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and discuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing recent attempts to consistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion that additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must \u201cscreen\u201d themselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into three \u2026",

The very recent developments in Grand-Unified-Theory baryogenesis, leptogenesis, electroweak baryogenesis, and the Affleck-Dine mechanism are presented. In particular, we focus on specific particle physics implementations, mostly in the context of supersymmetry, which lead to specific testable predictions.",
