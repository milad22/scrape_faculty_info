            "We consider antiferromagnets breaking both time-reversal (\u0398) and a primitive-lattice translational symmetry (T 1\/2) of a crystal but preserving the combination S= \u0398 T 1\/2. The S symmetry leads to a Z 2 topological classification of insulators, separating the ordinary insulator phase from the \u201cantiferromagnetic topological insulator\u201d phase. This state is similar to the \u201cstrong\u201d topological insulator with time-reversal symmetry and shares with it such properties as a quantized magnetoelectric effect. However, for certain surfaces the surface states are intrinsically gapped with a half-quantum Hall effect [\u03c3 x y= e 2\/(2 h)], which may aid experimental confirmation of \u03b8= \u03c0 quantized magnetoelectric coupling. Step edges on such a surface support gapless, chiral quantum wires. In closing we discuss GdBiPt as a possible example of this topological class.",

            "Non-Abelian anyons promise to reveal spectacular features of quantum mechanics that could ultimately provide the foundation for a decoherence-free quantum computer. A key breakthrough in the pursuit of these exotic particles originated from Read and Green\u2019s observation that the Moore-Read quantum Hall state and a (relatively simple) two-dimensional p+ i p superconductor both support so-called Ising non-Abelian anyons. Here, we establish a similar correspondence between the Z 3 Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state and a novel two-dimensional superconductor in which charge-2 e Cooper pairs are built from fractionalized quasiparticles. In particular, both phases harbor Fibonacci anyons that\u2014unlike Ising anyons\u2014allow for universal topological quantum computation solely through braiding. Using a variant of Teo and Kane\u2019s construction of non-Abelian phases from weakly coupled chains, we provide a \u2026",
