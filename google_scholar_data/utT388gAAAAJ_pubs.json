            "A member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family was cloned here. The channel, called BIR (Kir6.2), was expressed in large amounts in rat pancreatic islets and glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cell lines. Coexpression with the sulfonylurea receptor SUR reconstituted an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance of 76 picosiemens that was sensitive to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (IKATP) and was inhibited by sulfonylureas and activated by diazoxide. The data indicate that these pancreatic \u03b2 cell potassium channels are a complex composed of at least two subunits-BIR, a member of the inward rectifier potassium channel family, and SUR, a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Gene mapping data show that these two potassium channel subunit genes are clustered on human chromosome 11 at position 11p15.1.",

            "Sulfonylureas are a class of drugs widely used to promote insulin secretion in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These drugs interact with the sulfonylurea receptor of pancreatic beta cells and inhibit the conductance of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium (KATP) channels. Cloning of complementary DNAs for the high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor indicates that it is a member of the ATP-binding cassette or traffic ATPase superfamily with multiple membrane-spanning domains and two nucleotide binding folds. The results suggest that the sulfonylurea receptor may sense changes in ATP and ADP concentration, affect KATP channel activity, and thereby modulate insulin release.",

Coexpression of SUR2 and the inward rectifier K+ channel subunit Kir6.2 in COS1 cells reconstitutes the properties of KATP channels described in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The SUR2\/Kir6.2 channel is less sensitive than the SUR\/Kir6.2 channel (the pancreatic \u03b2 cell KATP channel) to both ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide and is activated by the cardiac KATP channel openers, cromakalim and pinacidil, but not by diazoxide. In addition, SUR2 binds glibenclamide with lower affinity. The present study shows that the ATP sensitivity and pharmacological properties of KATP channels are determined by a family of structurally related but functionally distinct sulfonylurea receptors.",

The newly cloned high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) gene, a regulator of insulin secretion, was mapped to 11p15.1 by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two separate SUR gene splice site mutations, which segregated with disease phenotype, were identified in affected individuals from nine different families. Both mutations resulted in aberrant processing of the RNA sequence and disruption of the putative second nucleotide binding domain of the SUR protein.

The medial hypothalamus is a major integrator of nutritional and hormonal signals 1, 2, 4, which play pivotal roles not only in the regulation of energy balance but also in the modulation of liver glucose output 5, 6. Bidirectional changes in hypothalamic insulin signalling therefore result in parallel changes in both energy balance 7, 8, 9, 10 and glucose metabolism 5. Here we show that activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channels 11 in the mediobasal hypothalamus is sufficient to lower blood glucose levels through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

            "The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, composed of the beta-cell proteins sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) and inward-rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2, is a key regulator of insulin release. It is inhibited by the binding of adenine nucleotides to subunit Kir6.2, which closes the channel, and activated by nucleotide binding or hydrolysis on SUR1, which opens the channel. The balance of these opposing actions determines the low open-channel probability, PO, which controls the excitability of pancreatic beta cells. We hypothesized that activating mutations in ABCC8, which encodes SUR1, cause neonatal diabetes.We screened the 39 exons of ABCC8 in 34 patients with permanent or transient neonatal diabetes of unknown origin. We assayed the electrophysiologic activity of mutant and wild-type KATP channels.We identified seven missense mutations in nine patients \u2026",

Physiol. Rev. 78: 227\u2013245, 1998.\u2014Adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channels couple metabolic events to membrane electrical activity in a variety of cell types. The cloning and reconstitution of the subunits of these channels demonstrate they are heteromultimers of inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits (K IR 6. x) and sulfonylurea receptors (SUR), members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Recent studies indicate that SUR and K IR 6. x associate with 1: 1 stoichiometry to assemble a large tetrameric channel,(SUR\/K IR 6. x) 4. The K IR 6. x subunits form the channel pore, whereas SUR is required for activation and regulation. Two K IR 6. x genes and two SUR genes have been \u2026",

            "ATP-sensitive potassium channels, termed KATP channels, link the electrical activity of cell membranes to cellular metabolism. These channels are heteromultimers of sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) and KIR6.x subunits associated with a 1:1 stoichiometry as a tetramer (SUR\/KIR6.x)4. KIR6.x forms the pores, whereas SUR regulates their activity. Changes in [ATP]i and [ADP]i gate the channel. The diversity of KATP channels results from the assembly of SUR and KIR6.x subtypes. KIR6.1-based channels differ from KIR6.2 channels mainly by their smaller unitary conductance. SUR1- and SUR2-based channels are distinguished by their differential sensitivity to sulfonylureas, whereas SUR2A-based channels are distinguished from SUR2B channels by their differential sensitivity to diazoxide. Mutations that result in the loss of KATP channels in pancreatic \u03b2-cells have been identified in SUR1 and KIR6.2 \u2026",
