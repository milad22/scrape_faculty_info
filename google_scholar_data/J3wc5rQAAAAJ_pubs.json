            "Extended supergravity theories with gauged SO(N) internal symmetry have, for N \u2265 4, scalar field potentials which are unbounded below. Nevertheless, it is argued that the theories have ground states with anti-de Sitter background geometry which are stable against fluctuations which vanish sufficiently fast at spatial infinity. Stability is implied because the appropriate conserved energy functional is positive for such fluctuations. Anti-de Sitter space is not globally hyperbolic, but the boundary conditions required for positive energy are also shown to give free field theories with well-defined Cauchy problem. New information on the particle representations of OSp(1, 4) supersymmetry is presented as part of the argument. Supersymmetry requires boundary conditions for spin 0 fields such that only the improved stress tensor leads to a conserved energy functional. Although the stability arguments support the view that \u2026",

            "As a new approach to supergravity, an action containing only vierbein and Rarita-Schwinger fields (Va\u03bc and \u03c8\u03bc) is presented together with supersymmetry transformations for these fields. The action is explicitly shown to be invariant except for a \u03c85 term in its variation. This term may also vanish, depending on a complicated calculation. (Added note: This term has now been shown to vanish by a computer calculation, so that the action presented here does possess full local supersymmetry.)",
