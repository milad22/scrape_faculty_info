            "The dynamics and statistical mechanics of the quark-hadron phase transition are explored using the bag model and the known spectrum of hadronic states. We compute the maximum amplitude for isothermal baryon number density fluctuations to emerge from this phase transition and their effects on primordial nucleosynthesis, as a function of the coexistence temperature (or bag constant) and the fractional volume of the universe which will remain in quark-gluon plasma when the release of latent heat no longer compensates the cooling due to expansion. For values of the bag constant, B<(260 MeV) 4, it is possible to find a pressure, temperature, and baryon-chemical-potential equilibrium between the quark-gluon phase and the hadron phase. We calculate the difference in baryon number concentration between these phases. This difference in baryon number concentration may lead to isothermal baryon density fluctuations. For B>(260 MeV) 4 phase equilibrium is not possible for temperatures below 300 MeV. Thus any differences in baryon concentration are small. In the extreme but interesting case of a Hagedorn limiting hadronic temperature and large bag constant we even find that the QCD vacuum energy can produce a mini-inflationary epoch. We discuss computations of the primordial nucleosynthesis yields corresponding to our estimates of the maximum baryon density fluctuations in a universe with Q= 1 in baryons. We find that 4He, 3He, and deuterium are within observed constraints for a large part of the parameter space. However, 7Li is overproduced. Within the parameter space for an Q= 1 universe we'find only a very small \u2026",

We find that such fluctuations are a natural consequence of a first-order phase transition occurring in the strongly interacting system. Fluctuation-generating mechanisms are discussed. We estimate the nucleation rate and derive the mean separation between fluctuations. It is shown that the amplitude of the fluctuations depends sensitively on the phase coexistence temperature T c and on the baryon transmission probability \u03a3 h at the phase boundary. For realistic values of \u03a3 h and T c the fluctuations are large and have a significant effect on primordial nucleosynthesis yields. With these fluctuations the limit on the baryonic contribution to \u03a9 depends primarily on what is taken to be the primordial Li 7 \u2026",

The relativistic field equations are solved at each time slice with a spatial three-metric chosen to be conformally flat. Against this solution to the general relativistic field equations, the hydrodynamic variables and gravitational radiation are allowed to respond. The gravitational radiation signal is derived via a multipole expansion of the metric perturbation to the hexadecapole (l= 4) order including both mass and current moments and a correction for the slow-motion approximation. Using this expansion, the effect of gravitational radiation on the system evolution can also be recovered by introducing an acceleration term in the matter evolution.

A full dynamical reaction network for both the \u03b1\u2010rich freezeout and the subsequent r\u2010process is employed. The physical properties of the neutrino\u2010heated ejecta are deduced from a general relativistic model in which spherical symmetry and steady flow are assumed. Our results suggest that proto\u2013neutron stars with a large compaction ratio provide the most robust physical conditions for the r\u2010process. The third peak of the r\u2010process is well reproduced in the winds from these \u201ccompact\u201d proto\u2013neutron stars even for a moderate entropy,  , and a neutrino luminosity as high as \u223c1052 ergs s\u22121. This is due to the short dynamical timescale of material in the wind. As a result, the overproduction of nuclei with   is diminished (although some overproduction of nuclei with   is still evident \u2026",
