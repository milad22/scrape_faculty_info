            "A longstanding question in molecular biology is the extent to which the behavior of macromolecules observed in vitro accurately reflects their behavior in vivo. A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and \u201csnapshots\u201d of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited \u201ccrowding\u201d effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.",

            "Salt bridges have been proposed to play a crucial role in promoting hyperthermostability in proteins, yet they appear to make little contribution to protein stability at room temperature. The latter point has been rationalized previously on the basis that the association of two charged molecules to form a salt bridge incurs a substantial desolvation penalty, which is seldom completely compensated by favourable interactions within the salt bridge and with the rest of the protein. Here a continuum solvation model is used to investigate how this same argument applies at temperatures more appropriate to hyperthermophiles. The solvation model employed was previously parameterised to reproduce the hydration free energies of neutral and charged amino acid side-chains in the temperature range from 5\u2013100\u00b0C. A key result of the previous work was that the hydration free energies of charged side-chains are more adversely \u2026",

Theoretical calculations and molecular simulations have, in particular, been exploited to describe aspects of protein behavior in crowded and confined conditions and many aspects of the simulated behavior have reflected, at least at a qualitative level, the behavior observed in experiments. One major and immediate challenge for the theorists is to now produce models capable of making quantitatively accurate predictions of in vitro behavior. A second challenge is to derive models that explain results obtained from experiments performed in vivo, the results of which appear to call into question the assumed dominance of excluded-volume effects in vivo.",

            "Recent advances have led to insights into the structure of the bacterial ribosome, but little is known about the 3D organization of ribosomes in the context of translating polysomes. We employed cryoelectron tomography and a template-matching approach to map 70S ribosomes in vitrified bacterial translation extracts and in lysates of active E. coli spheroplasts. In these preparations, polysomal arrangements were observed in which neighboring ribosomes are densely packed and exhibit preferred orientations. Analysis of characteristic examples of polysomes reveals a staggered or pseudohelical organization of ribosomes along the mRNA trace, with the transcript being sequestered on the inside, the tRNA entrance sites being accessible, and the polypeptide exit sites facing the cytosol. Modeling of elongating nascent polypeptide chains suggests that this arrangement maximizes the distance between nascent \u2026",

Many of these residues are charged residues that are located in electrostatically unfavorable environments. Here it is demonstrated that because continuum electrostatics methods can identify these destabilizing residues, the same methods can also be used to identify functionally important residues in otherwise uncharacterized proteins. To establish this point, detailed calculations are performed on six proteins for which good structural and mutational data are available from experiments. In all cases it is shown that functionally important residues known to be destabilizing experimentally are among the most destabilizing residues found in the calculations.

To investigate the magnitude and importance of such electrostatic interactions, we conducted a theoretical analysis of their contributions to the salt and pH-dependence of stability of two halophilic proteins.

In a first set of simulations, the ordering of the experimental rate constants for the mutant proteins was correctly reproduced, although the absolute values of the rate constants were overestimated by a factor of around 30.

            "A convenient computational approach for the calculation of the p Kas of ionizable groups in a protein is described. The method uses detailed models of the charges in both the neutral and ionized form of each ionizable group. A full derivation of the theoretical framework is presented, as are details of its implementation in the UHBD program. Application to four proteins whose crystal structures are known shows that the detailed charge model improves agreement with experimentally determined pKas when a low protein dielectric constant is assumed, relative to the results with a simpler single\u2010site ionization model. It is also found that use of the detailed charge model increases the sensitivity of the computed pKas to the details of proton placement. \u00a9 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
