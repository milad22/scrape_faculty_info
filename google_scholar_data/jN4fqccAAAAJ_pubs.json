            "Unveiling new topological phases of matter is one of the current objectives in condensed matter physics. Recent experimental discoveries of Dirac and Weyl semimetals prompt the search for other exotic phases of matter. Here we present a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of ZrSiS, a prime topological nodal semimetal candidate. Our wider Brillouin zone (BZ) mapping shows multiple Fermi surface pockets such as the diamond-shaped Fermi surface, elliptical-shaped Fermi surface, and a small electron pocket encircling at the zone center (\u0393) point, the M point, and the X point of the BZ, respectively. We experimentally establish the spinless nodal fermion semimetal phase in ZrSiS, which is supported by our first-principles calculations. Our findings evidence that the ZrSiS-type of material family is a new platform on which to explore exotic states of quantum matter; these materials are \u2026",

Here, we present a comparative electronic structure study of ZrSi X (where X= S, Se, Te) using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations. Our ARPES studies show that the overall electronic structure of ZrSi X materials comprises the diamond-shaped Fermi pocket, the nearly elliptical-shaped Fermi pocket, and a small electron pocket encircling the zone center (\u0393) point, the M point, and the X point of the Brillouin zone, respectively.

Here we report a systematic high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study of the normal state electronic and spin properties of BiPd. Our experimental results show the presence of a surface state at higher-binding energy with the location of Dirac point at around 700 meV below the Fermi level. The detailed photon energy, temperature-dependent and spin-resolved ARPES measurements complemented by our first-principles calculations demonstrate the existence of the spin-polarized surface states at high-binding energy.

In nodal-line Dirac semimetals, the conductance and valence bands connect along a closed path in momentum space, leading to the prediction of pseudospin vortex rings and pseudospin skyrmions. Here, we use Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS) at 4.5 K to resolve quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns at single defect centers on the surface of the line nodal semimetal zirconium silicon sulfide (ZrSiS). Our QPI measurements show pseudospin conservation at energies close to the line node.
