            "For 3-dimensional field theories with supersymmetry the Euclidean path integrals on the three-sphere can be calculated using the method of localization; they reduce to certain matrix integrals that depend on the R-charges of the matter fields. We solve a number ofsuch large N matrix models and calculate the free energy F as a function of the trial R-charges consistent with the marginality of the super potential. In all our superconformal examples, the local maximization of F yields answers that scale as N 3\/2 and agree with the dual M-theory backgrounds AdS 4\u00d7 Y, where Y are 7-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein spaces. We also find in toric examples that local F-maximization is equivalent to the minimization of the volume of Y over the space of Sasakian metrics, a procedure also referred to as Z-minimization. Moreover, we find that the functions F and Z are related for any trial R-charges. In the models we \u2026",

What makes these backgrounds p-wave superconductors is that the order parameter is a vector, and the conductivities are strongly anisotropic in a manner that is suggestive of a gap with nodes. The low-lying excitations of the normal state have a relaxation time which grows rapidly as the temperature decreases, consistent with the absence of impurity scattering. A numerical exploration of quasinormal modes close to the transition temperature suggests that p-wave backgrounds are stable against perturbations analogous to turning on a p+ip gap, whereas p+ip-wave configurations are unstable against turning into pure p-wave backgrounds.",

In previous work various successful tests of this proposal were carried out for theories with supersymmetry. In this paper we perform more general tests that do not rely on supersymmetry. We study perturbatively the RG flows produced by weakly relevant operators and show that the free energy decreases monotonically. We also consider large N field theories perturbed by relevant double trace operators, free massive field theories, and some non-Abelian gauge theories. In all cases the free energy in the IR is smaller than in the UV, consistent with the F-theorem.
