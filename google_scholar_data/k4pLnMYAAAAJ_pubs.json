            "The extent of the soil organic carbon pool doubles that present in the atmosphere and is about two to three times greater than that accumulated in living organisms in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. In such a scenario, one of the several ecological and environmental impacts of fires is that biomass burning is a significant source of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. Nevertheless, the oxidation of biomass is usually incomplete and a range of pyrolysis compounds and particulate organic matter (OM) in aerosols are produced simultaneously to the thermal modification of pre-existing C forms in soil. These changes lead to the evolution of the OM to \u201cpyromorphic humus\u201d, composed by rearranged macromolecular substances of weak colloidal properties and an enhanced resistance against chemical and biological degradation.

Wildfire resulted in a doubling of organic C and N concentration in the A horizon (0\u201315 cm) of FA. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed that all C compound classes were enriched, including O- and N-alkyl C, with the highest for aromatic C (enrichment factor: 2.9).

            "Soil health refers to the biological, chemical, and physical features of soil that are essential to long-term, sustainable agricultural productivity with minimal environmental impact. Thus, soil health provides an overall picture of soil functionality. Although it cannot be measured directly, soil health can be inferred by measuring specific soil properties (eg organic matter content) and by observing soil status (eg fertility). There is also increased interest in studying soil microorganisms in their particular environments, as microbial diversity is intimately related to soil structure and function. One of the key objectives in determining soil health is to acquire indicators that can be used to evaluate the soil\u2019s current status and hence to develop sustainable agricultural systems. In this regard, significant progress has been made over the last few years in the development of specific biomarkers and macromolecular probes, enabling rapid and reliable measurements of soil microbial communities. In addition, modern molecular biological techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), have facilitated the analysis of microbial biodiversity and activity, whereas the application of modern analytical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and pyrolysisgas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), have provided data on soil chemistry. The combination of these two approaches offers promise in determining soil health status.[Int Microbiol 2005; 8 (1): 13-21]",

The solid-state 15N-NMR spectra of biomass subjected to severe heating revealed amide-N in forms which are resistant to the thermal treatment. Progressive burning was found to occur in two well-defined stages: In the early stage the free amino acid and some NH2 groups were removed, but no substantial disruption of the peptide structure was observed. In the final stage of burning the amide-N was converted to heterocyclic structures such as pyrroles, imidazoles and indoles.

            "A laboratory experiment was designed to investigate the degradation patterns of leaves from 12 forest and shrub species typical of Mediterranean ecosystems by solid-state 13C NMR. The spectral data have been compared with those for the major organic fractions, and elementary composition in three transformation stages (zero time, intermediated and advanced (168 d)). The plant material in general showed a selective depletion of lipid and water-soluble products and a concentration in acid-insoluble residue (Klason lignin fraction), but the increasing percentage of total alkyl carbons (not observed in pine leaves) suggests that recalcitrant aliphatic material accumulates in the course of the 168 d incubation, when the total weight losses were up to 660 g kg\u22121. This contrasts with the fact that the concentration of extractable alkyl C (i.e. the lipid fraction) decreased in all cases. The results for the different plants \u2026",

            "The elemental and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of laboratory prepared char samples from the main plant biopolymers (cellulose, lignin, casein), as well as grass and beech sawdust, indicated a greater chemical heterogeneity of plant derived chars than generally assumed from common black carbon (BC) models. The data support a recent concept proposing char as a heterogeneous mixture of thermally altered biomacromolecules with N, O and likely also S substitutions as common features. In contrast to soot, graphitic polyaromatic domains play a minor role in such chars. The high resistance of casein against thermal treatment and the low atomic N\/C values for grass chars demonstrate the quantitative importance of pyrogenic N. A more detailed consideration is needed if a more realistic view of the role of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) in soils and sediments is required.",
