We located a green fluorescence protein (GFP)\u2013tagged peroxisome in cultured Drosophila S2 cells to within 1.5 nanometers in 1.1 milliseconds, a 400-fold improvement in temporal resolution, sufficient to determine the average step size to be \u223c8 nanometers for both dynein and kinesin. Furthermore, we found that dynein and kinesin do not work against each other in vivo during peroxisome transport. Rather, multiple kinesins or multiple dyneins work together, producing up to 10 times the in vitro speed.",

If, instead, the sample is moved away from the focus, the point-spread-function depends on both the position and 3D orientation of the fluorophore, which can be calculated by defocused orientation and position imaging (DOPI). DOPI does not always yield position accurately, but it is possible to switch back and forth between focused and defocused imaging, thereby getting the centroid and the orientation with precision. We have measured the 3D orientation and stepping behavior of single bifunctional rhodamine probes attached to one of the calmodulins of the light-chain domain (LCD) of myosin V as myosin V moves along actin. Concomitant with large and small steps, the LCD rotates and then dwells in the leading and trailing position, respectively \u2026",

The myosin V was labeled with bifunctional rhodamine on one of its calmodulin light chains. For every 74 nm translocation, the probe exhibited two reorientational motions, associated with alternating smaller and larger translational steps. Molecules previously identified as stepping alternatively 74\u20100 nm were found to actually step 64\u201010 nm. Additional tilting often occurred without full steps, possibly indicating flexibility of the attached myosin heads or probing of their vicinity. Processive myosin V molecules sometimes shifted from the top to the side of actin, possibly to avoid an obstacle.

With the exception of doubletime-short (DBTS), all mutants produce differential PER degradation profiles that show direct correspondence with their respective Drosophila behavioral phenotypes.

            "The molecular clock relies on a delayed negative feedback loop of transcriptional regulation to generate oscillating gene expression. Although the principal components of the clock are present in all circadian neurons, different neuronal clusters have varying effects on rhythmic behavior, suggesting that the clocks they house are differently regulated. Combining biochemical and genetic techniques in Drosophila, we identify a phosphorylation program native to the master pacemaker neurons that regulates the timing of nuclear accumulation of the Period\/Timeless repressor complex. GSK-3\/SGG binds and phosphorylates Period-bound Timeless, triggering a CK2-mediated phosphorylation cascade. Mutations that block the hierarchical phosphorylation of Timeless in vitro also delay nuclear accumulation in both tissue culture and in vivo and predictably change rhythmic behavior. This two-kinase phosphorylation \u2026",
