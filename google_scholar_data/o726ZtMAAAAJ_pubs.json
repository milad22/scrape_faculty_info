            "Very recently, the half-metallic compound Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 was proposed to be a magnetic Weyl semimetal (WSM) with Weyl points only 60 meV above the Fermi level E F. Owing to the low charge carrier density and large Berry curvature induced, Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 possesses both a large anomalous Hall conductivity and a large anomalous Hall angle, which provide strong evidence for the existence of Weyl points in Co 3 Sn 2 S 2. In this work, we theoretically study the surface topological feature of Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 and its counterpart Co 3 Sn 2 Se 2. By cleaving the sample at the weak Sn-S\/Se bonds, one can achieve two different surfaces terminated with Sn and S\/Se atoms, respectively. The resulting Fermi-arc-related states can range from the energy of the Weyl points to E F\u2212 0.1 eV in the Sn-terminated surface. Therefore, it should be possible to observe the Fermi arcs in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy \u2026",

Nanotechnol. 8, 723 (2013)]. The computed anomalous and topological Hall effects in FeGe are also in good agreement with available experiments.

Current research of these relativistic spin\u2013orbit torques focuses primarily on magnetic transition-metal multilayers. The low-temperature diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ga, Mn) As, in which spin\u2013orbit torques were initially discovered, has so far remained the only example showing the phenomenon among bulk non-centrosymmetric ferromagnets.

The magnetization varied smoothly from the bulklike values of one Bohr magneton per Fe atom for FeGe to zero for nonmagnetic CoGe. The chiral lattice structure leads to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the films' helical magnetic ground state was confirmed using polarized neutron reflectometry measurements. The pitch of the spin helix, measured by this method, varies with Co content y and diverges at y\u223c 0.45. This indicates a zero crossing of the DMI, which we reproduced in calculations using first-principles methods.

Here, we report the observation of a large topological Hall effect in high-quality films of Mn 1.5 PtSn that were grown by means of magnetron sputtering on MgO (001). The topological Hall resistivity is present up to \u03bc 0 H\u2248 4 T below the spin reorientation transition temperature, T s= 185 K. We find that the maximum topological Hall resistivity is of comparable magnitude as the anomalous Hall resistivity. Owing to the size, the topological Hall effect is directly evident prior to the customarily performed subtraction of magnetometry data. Further, we underline the robustness of the topological Hall effect in Mn 2\u2212 x PtSn by extracting the effect for multiple stoichiometries (x= 0.5, 0.25, 0.1) and film thicknesses (t= 104, 52, 35 nm) with maximum topological Hall resistivities between 0.76 and 1.55 \u03bc \u2026",

Though the net magnetic moment is zero, the Weyl points in these systems lead to a large anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) due to the lack of a global time-reversal symmetry operation that inverts the sign of the Berry curvature. In comparison to the noncollinear antiferromagnets Mn 3 Sn and Mn 3 Ge, the high ANC stems almost entirely from the Weyl points in this class of compounds, and thus it is topologically protected. This work shows a large ANC with zero net magnetic moments in collinear systems, which is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the thermoelectric effect in zero-moment magnetic materials and its further applications.",
