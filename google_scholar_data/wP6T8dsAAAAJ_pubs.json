We have determined the half-life of the superallowed emitter Ar 34 to be 843.8 (4) ms; the quoted precision, 0.05%, is a factor of five improvement on the best previous measurement and meets this demanding requirement. Our measurement employed a high-efficiency gas counter, which was sensitive to positrons from both Ar 34 and its daughter Cl 34. We achieved the required precision on Ar 34 by analyzing the parent-daughter composite decay with a new fitting technique. We also obtained an improved half-life for Cl 34 of 1.5268 (5) s, which has 0.03% precision and is a factor of two improvement on previous results. As a by-product of these measurements, we determined the half-life of Ar 35 to be \u2026",

            "We construct flipped SU (5) GUT models as type IIB flux vacua on Z 2\u00d7 Z 2 orientifolds. Turning on supergravity self-dual NSNS and RR three-form fluxes fixes the toroidal complex structure moduli and the dilaton. We give a specific example of a three-generation flipped SU (5) model with a complete Higgs sector where supersymmetry is softly broken by the supergravity fluxes in the closed string sector. All of the required Yukawa couplings are present if global U (1) factors resulting from a generalized Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism are broken spontaneously or by world-sheet instantons. In addition, the model contains extra chiral and vector-like matter, potentially of mass O (M string) via trilinear superpotential couplings.",
