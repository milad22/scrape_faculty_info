            "We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16\u2264 z\u2264 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H 0), the mass density (\u03a9 M), the cosmological constant (ie, the vacuum energy density, \u03a9 \u039b), the deceleration parameter (q 0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t 0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%\u201315% farther than expected in a low mass density (\u03a9 M= 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant.

These independent observations, analyzed by similar but distinct methods, confirm the results of Riess and Perlmutter and coworkers that supernova luminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. More importantly, they extend the redshift range of consistently observed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to  , where the signature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausible systematic effects. Consequently, these measurements not only provide another quantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute a powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration. We find a rate for SN Ia of   at a mean redshift of 0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for 230 SN Ia. These place the following constraints on cosmological quantities \u2026",

Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z\u2265 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25< z< 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral \u2026",

The superb spatial resolution of HST separates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision in the light curves. We use these light curves and relations between luminosity, light-curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples to derive relative luminosity distances that are accurate to 10% at z\u2248 0.5 and 20% at z= 1.
