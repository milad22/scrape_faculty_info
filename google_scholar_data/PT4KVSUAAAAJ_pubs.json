Phase mismatch was used to exclude the single-atom cutoff of the spectrum that possesses unfavorable attochirp, allowing the positive attochirp of the remaining spectrum to be compensated by the negative dispersion of a zirconium foil. Two algorithms, PROOF and FROG-CRAB, were employed to retrieve the pulse from the experimental spectrogram, yielding nearly identical results.",

Rapid progress has been made in both aspects, leading to the generation of light pulses as short as 67 as in 2012, and broadband attosecond continua covering a wide range of extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray wavelengths. Such pulses have been successfully applied in photoelectron and photoion spectroscopy and recently developed attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study electron dynamics in matter. In this Review, we discuss significant recent advances in the generation, characterization and applications of ultrabroadband, isolated attosecond pulses with spectral bandwidths comparable to the central frequency. These pulses can in principle be compressed to a single optical cycle.",

So far, such extreme ultraviolet pulses have only been generated using high power, few-cycle lasers, which are very difficult to construct and operate. We propose and demonstrate a technique called generalized double optical gating for generating isolated attosecond pulses with 20 fs lasers from a hollow-core fiber and 28 fs lasers directly from an amplifier. These pulses, generated from argon gas, are measured to be 260 and 148 as by reconstructing the streaked photoelectron spectrograms. This scheme, with a relaxed requirement on laser pulse duration, makes attophysics more accessible to many laboratories that are capable of producing such multicycle laser pulses.",
