            "An era of exploring the interactions of high-intensity, hard X-rays with matter has begun with the start-up of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Understanding how electrons in matter respond to ultra-intense X-ray radiation is essential for all applications. Here we reveal the nature of the electronic response in a free atom to unprecedented high-intensity, short-wavelength, high-fluence radiation (respectively 10 18 W cm\u2212 2, 1.5\u20130.6 nm,\u223c 10 5 X-ray photons per \u00c5 2). At this fluence, the neon target inevitably changes during the course of a single femtosecond-duration X-ray pulse\u2014by sequentially ejecting electrons\u2014to produce fully-stripped neon through absorption of six photons. Rapid photoejection of inner-shell electrons produces \u2018hollow\u2019atoms and an intensity-induced X-ray transparency. Such transparency, due to the presence of inner-shell vacancies, can be induced in all \u2026",

Polarized deuterium atoms were confined within a storage cell in the VEPP-3 electron storage ring in Novosibirsk to achieve a total target thickness of 3\u00d7 10 12 cm\u2212 2, 15 times greater than was previously possible with an atomic-beam target alone.

Low \u03b42H values of the 81Kr\u2010dated groundwater reveal a recurrent Atlantic moisture source during Pleistocene pluvial periods. These results indicate that the 81Kr method for dating old groundwater is robust and such measurements can now be applied to a wide range of hydrologic problems.",

The production of Ne 9+ is observed at x-ray frequencies below the Ne 8+, 1 s 2 absorption edge and demonstrates a clear quadratic dependence on fluence. Theoretical analysis shows that the production is a combination of the two-photon ionization of Ne 8+ ground state and a high-order sequential process involving single-photon production and ionization of transient excited states on a time scale faster than the Auger decay. We find that the nonlinear direct two-photon ionization cross section is orders of magnitude higher than expected from previous calculations.",
