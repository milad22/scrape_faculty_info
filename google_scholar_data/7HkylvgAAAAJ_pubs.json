The phase and polarization of the excitation source are first introduced as tools for control over the pathway of light at array intersections. Genetic algorithms are next applied as a systematic design tool, wherein both the excitation field parameters and the structural parameters of the nanoparticle array are optimized to make devices with desired functionality. Implications to research fields such as single molecule spectroscopy, spatially confined chemistry, optical logic, and nanoscale sensing are envisioned. ",

The coupling manifests itself as an anticrossing behavior of the two newly formed polaritons. As the coupling strength grows, a new mode emerges, which is attributed to long-range molecular interactions mediated by the plasmonic field. The new, molecular-like mode repels the polariton states, and leads to an opening of energy gaps both below and above the asymptotic free molecule energy.",

This is done by numerically solving the corresponding system of coupled Maxwell-Liouville equations for various geometries. In particular, we scrutinize linear optical properties of nanoscale atomic clusters, demonstrating the significant role played by collective effects and dephasing. It is shown that subwavelength atomic clusters exhibit two resonant modes, one of which is localized slightly below the atomic transition frequency of an individual atom, while the other is positioned considerably above it. As an initial exploration of future applications of this approach, the optical response of core-shell nanostructures, with a core consisting of silver and a shell composed of resonant atoms, is examined.",

The switch consists of a conjugated organic molecule adsorbed onto a semiconducting surface and placed near a scanning tunneling microscope tip. A low-frequency, polarized laser field is used to switch the system by orienting the molecule with the field polarization axis, enabling conductance through the junction. Enhancement and spatial localization of the incident field by the metallic tip allow operation at low intensities. The principles of nonadiabatic alignment lead to switch on and off time scales far below rotational time scales.",

Applications to CW light scattering as well as transient response and relaxation are described. Particular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the hybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed. While traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of the electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that individually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the consequences \u2026",

The model represents a charge-transfer molecule in a junction and is a generalization of previously published results [BD Fainberg, M. Jouravlev, and A. Nitzan, Phys. Rev. B 76, 245329 (2007)]. Effects of local field for realistic junction geometries and non-Markov response of the molecule are taken into account within finite-difference time-domain and on-the-contour equation-of-motion formulations, respectively. We find that contrary to the symmetric behavior of the pump relative to the chirp sign, the duration of the corresponding local-field pulse does depend on the chirp sign, which results in an asymmetric charge pumping. The most effective charge-pump regime is found at positive bias, contrary to Markov consideration of the previous study.",
