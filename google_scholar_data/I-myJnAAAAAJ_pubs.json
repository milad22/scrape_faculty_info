            "Low-temperature transport properties were systemically studied for the optimal magnetic coupled polycrystalline La 2\u2215 3 Ca 1\u2215 3 Mn O 3 system under an applied magnetic field from 0 to 8.0 T. The temperature dependence of resistivity shows a generally minimum behavior at low temperatures (T< 30 K) under various applied fields. For the low fields of H< 1.0 T, best fittings were made by considering both the electron-electron (ee) interactions in terms of T 1\u2215 2 dependence and the Kondo-like spin dependent scattering in terms of ln T dependence. But for the high fields, at the low-temperature region of T< 15 K, accompanying a disappearance of Kondo term ln T, the electronic resistivity only follows T 1\u2215 2 dependence, which is a characteristic of enhanced ee interactions in three dimension (3D) disorder system, and is also confirmed by the specific-heat measurement. It is found that the ln T dependence of \u2026",

            "A Kondo-like transport was observed in a metal-semiconductor transition (MSC) at low temperatures in the ferromagnetic metallic phase of the perovskite manganites. Experimental data can be best fitted in the framework of Kondo scattering, electron-electron (e\u2212 e), and electron-phonon (e\u2212 p) interaction. The results show that this behavior depends strongly on the content of the spin-glass phase and can be tuned with an applied magnetic field, which can be explained by the spin disorder scattering of electrons and\/or antiferromagnetic cluster on a nanoscale and\/or microscale, the interaction and strong correlation between electrons, and antiferromagnetic background. For the undoped samples, the MSC transition means the existence of intrinsic spin disorder with magnetic inhomogeneity.

In magnetization measurements, La 2 ZnIrO 6 displays weak ferromagnetic behavior below 7.5 K, whereas La 2 MgIrO 6 shows antiferromagnetic behavior below T N= 12 K. Electronic structure calculations find that the weak ferromagnetic behavior observed in La 2 ZnIrO 6 is in fact due to canted antiferromagnetism. The calculations also predict canted antiferromagnetic behavior in La 2 MgIrO 6, but intriguingly, this was not observed. Neutron diffraction measurements confirm the essentially antiferromagnetic behavior of both systems but lack the sensitivity to resolve the small (0.22 \u03bc B\/Ir) ferromagnetic component in La 2 ZnIrO 6.

From our extensive dc and ac magnetic measurements, we have determined that the ferromagnetic layers of Fe 3 GeTe 2 actually order antiferromagnetically along the c-axis below 152 K. The antiferromagnetic state was further substantiated by theoretical calculation to be the ground state. A magnetic structure model was proposed to describe the antiferromagnetic ground state as well as competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states.

Whether this insulating phase is Mott-or Slater-type, has been under intense debate. We address this issue via spatially resolved imaging and spectroscopic studies of the Sr 2 IrO 4 surface using scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy (STM\/S). STS results clearly illustrate the opening of an insulating gap (150~ 250 meV) below the N\u00e9el temperature (T N), in qualitative agreement with our density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. More importantly, the temperature dependence of the gap is qualitatively consistent with our DFT+ dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) results, both showing a continuous transition from a gapped insulating ground state to a non-gap phase as temperatures approach T N.
