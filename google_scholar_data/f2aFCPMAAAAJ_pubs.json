            "What do social workers need to know in order to practise skilfully and effectively? The second edition of this highly respected text gives you the understanding to bridge the gap between social work theory and the challenges of day-to-day practice. Critical Practice in Social Work is different from every other text for several reasons:-Its unique combination of theory, values and practice-The wealth of expertise its contributors bring to their subject-The way the themes of critical practice and reflective practice are used to show how theories can be applied meaningfully-The number of methods covered, in an'easy reference'structure-Its in-depth look at an unrivalled spectrum of professional situations, illustrated by rich case material-Its systematic discussion of professional ethics and values, both as general principles for practice and as practical tools. The book's simultaneous accessibility and depth make it suited for study at both qualifying and post-qualifying level. Conveying the versatility and thoughtfulness required to do social work well, it is an essential purchase for every aspiring and practising social worker's bookshelf. It is one of three interrelated books edited by the internationally renowned and widely published team, Robert Adams, Lena Dominelli and Malcolm Payne. The companion books are Social Work: Themes, Issues and Critical Debates (third edition) and Practising Social Work in a Complex World. Each book can be used alone or in combination with the other two as a uniquely flexible and comprehensive programme of study.",

            "In spite of significant public concern, professional efforts and financial expenditure, there has been a perceived lack of progress in reducing the incidence of child abuse, and in improving the outcomes for children in both the short and longer term. In this article the authors reflect on recent policy developments in the United Kingdom relating to children and families experiencing multiple adversities, and argue that the current conceptualisation of child abuse is flawed. In adopting a rational technical approach to the management of child abuse, there is a tendency to focus on shorter term outcomes for the child, such as immediate safety, that primarily reflect the outputs of the child protection system. However, by viewing child abuse as a wicked problem, that is complex and less amenable to being solved, then child welfare professionals can be supported to focus on achieving longer term outcomes for children that are \u2026",

Understanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences on outcomes in adulthood is therefore key to informing effective policy and practice. In this article, the research on the impact of childhood adversity on outcomes in adulthood is reviewed in the broad categories of: mental health and social functioning; physical health; offending; service use; and economic impact. The literature on resilience that focuses on those who experience adversity, but do not have associated negative outcomes is also briefly considered. The strengths and limitations of the range of research methods used are then examined.\u2022 Findings: Previous studies have tended to focus on specific forms of adversity, predominantly abuse and neglect, and either: specific \u2026",

A challenge for practitioners, researchers and policy-makers alike has been the absence of a shared conceptual framework for considering and responding to the needs of looked-after children. A second challenge relates to the measurement of outcomes. In this article the authors reflect on the multiple factors that contribute to outcomes for looked-after children and, drawing upon the work of Cronen and Pearce, propose an organising framework. In as much as it facilitates reflection on the complex interplay between looked-after children and their environments, the ecological perspective outlined in this article holds some promise as an aid to targeting interventions more effectively and efficiently.",

Research indicates that adverse experiences in childhood can result in poor outcomes in adulthood in terms of lack of employment, poorer physical and mental health and increases in social problems experienced. It is acknowledged that most of these children are known to child welfare professionals and that some are referred to social services, subsequently entering the child protection system.
