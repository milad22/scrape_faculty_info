Grafting DNA onto nano-and microparticles can, in principle,\u2018program\u2019them with information that tells them exactly how to self-assemble. Although fully programmable assembly has not yet been realized, the groundwork has been laid: with an understanding of how specific interparticle attractions arise from DNA hybridization, we can now make systems that reliably assemble in and out of equilibrium. We discuss these advances, and the design rules that will allow us to control\u2014and ultimately program\u2014the assembly of new materials.",

Surprisingly, given the fact that the thermodynamics of DNA strands in solution are completely understood, existing models for DNA-induced particle interactions are typically in error by more than an order of magnitude in strength and a factor of two in their temperature dependence. This discrepancy has stymied efforts to design the complex temperature, sequence and time-dependent interactions needed for the most interesting applications, such as materials having highly complex or multicomponent microstructures or the ability to reconfigure or self-replicate.

Depending on the relative strength of the different interactions, the suspensions spontaneously form either compositionally ordered crystals with CsCl and CuAu-I symmetries, or disordered, solid solution crystals when slowly cooled. Our observations indicate that the CuAu-I crystals form from CsCl parent crystals by a diffusionless transformation, analogous to the Martensitic transformation of iron. Detailed simulations confirm that CuAu-I is not kinetically accessible by direct nucleation from the fluid, but does have a lower free energy than CsCl. The ease with which such structural \u2026",

Under fuel lean conditions, the addition of Mn or Fe slightly improved the NOx storage, while the addition of Co more than doubled the NOx storage. In addition, a noble metal free 5Co\/15Ba catalyst was found to store NOx as efficiently as a 1Pt\/15Ba NSR catalyst. This increase in efficiency is associated with the strong oxidizing effect of Co, providing nitric oxide oxidation sites and contact area for NO2 spillover to the Ba NOx storage sites. By utilizing Co as an oxidizing metal instead of Pt, the storage capacity of NSR catalysts can be improved without the need for an expensive noble metal oxidizing catalyst.",

At high DNA density, the binding kinetics is limited by the rate of microsphere diffusion and displays the expected dependence on the interaction potential energy. At low DNA density, the particle binding kinetics is set by single molecular binding events and exhibits bound times having a non-exponential distribution, suggesting that individual DNA bridges may also have intrinsic non-exponential kinetics.

The resulting crystals display a stop band at visible wavelengths that can be tuned with temperature at a rate of 60 nm\/s, nearly three orders of magnitude faster than previous photonic-crystal hydrogels. Above a critical concentration of depleting agent, the crystals do not melt even at 40 degrees Celsius. As a result, the stop band can be modulated continuously from red (650 nm) to blue (450 nm), with nearly constant reflectivity throughout the visible spectrum.

Using a simple model of the motion of the contact line, we show that the observed coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom is likely due to contact-line pinning.
