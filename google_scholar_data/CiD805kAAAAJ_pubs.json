            "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
