            "Two distinct types of magnetoresistance oscillations are observed in two electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers of different sizes in the integer quantum Hall regime. Measuring these oscillations as a function of magnetic field and gate voltages, we describe three signatures that distinguish the two types. The oscillations observed in a 2.0 \u03bc m 2 device are understood to arise from a Coulomb blockade mechanism and those observed in an 18 \u03bc m 2 device from an Aharonov-Bohm mechanism. This work clarifies, provides ways to distinguish, and demonstrates control over these distinct mechanisms of oscillations seen in electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers.",

Confined systems that support such states at a filling fraction \u03bd= 5\/2 are of particular interest for testing these predictions. Here, we report transport measurements of just such a system, which consists of a quantum point contact (QPC) in a two-dimensional GaAs\/AlGaAs electron gas that itself exhibits a well-developed fractional quantum Hall effect at a bulk filling fraction \u03bd bulk= 5\/2. We observe plateau-like features at an effective filling fraction of \u03bd QPC= 5\/2 for lithographic contact widths of 1.2 \u03bcm and 0.8 \u03bcm, but not 0.5 \u03bcm. Transport near \u03bd QPC= 5\/2 in the QPCs is consistent with a picture of chiral Luttinger-liquid edge states with inter-edge tunnelling, suggesting that an incompressible state at \u03bd QPC= 5\/2 forms in this confined \u2026",

For interferometers sufficiently large that Coulomb blockade effects are absent, a checkerboardlike pattern of conductance oscillations as a function of dc bias and perpendicular magnetic field is observed. Edge-state velocities extracted from the checkerboard data are compared to model calculations and found to be consistent with a crossover from skipping orbits at low fields to E\u2192\u00d7 B\u2192 drift at high fields. Suppression of visibility as a function of bias and magnetic field is accounted for by including energy-and field-dependent dephasing of edge electrons.",

The phase delay between a point heat source and a set of detection points around it allows for high-resolution measurement of the thermal diffusivity and its in-plane anisotropy. Although the magnitude of the diffusivity may suggest that it originates from phonons, its anisotropy is comparable with reported values of the electrical resistivity anisotropy. Furthermore, the anisotropy drops sharply below the charge order transition, again similar to the electrical resistivity anisotropy. Both of these observations suggest that the thermal diffusivity has pronounced electronic as well as phononic character. At the same time, the small electrical and thermal conductivities at high temperatures imply that neither well-defined electron nor phonon quasiparticles are present in this \u2026",

By mitigating the effects of off-chip losses downstream, the on-chip gain of this device produces end-to-end measurement efficiencies of up to 80%.
