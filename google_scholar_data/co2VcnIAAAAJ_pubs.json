LEDs with external quantum efficiencies as high as 4% were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and found to contain dislocation densities in excess of 2\u00d71010 cm\u22122. A comparison to other III\u2013V arsenide and phosphide LEDs shows that minority carries in GaN\u2010based LEDs are remarkably insensitive to the presence of structural defects. Dislocations do not act as efficient nonradiative recombination sites in nitride materials. It is hypothesized that the benign character of dislocations arises from the ionic nature of bonding in the III\u2013V nitrides.",

            "It is demonstrated that hydrogenation induces microdefects and electronic deep levels in single-crystal silicon, which are unrelated to either plasma or radiation damage. After hydrogenation of either n-type or p-type silicon, transmission electron microscopy reveals defects that can be described as hydrogen-stabilized platelets or microcracks which appear within 0.1 \u03bcm of the exposed surface and are predominantly oriented along {111} crystallographic planes. These defects correlate with high concentrations of hydrogen or deuterium as measured by secondary-ion mass spectrometry and with the appearance of Si\u2014H bonds as revealed by Raman spectroscopy. The concomitant introduction of electrically active gap states is demonstrated with both photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). In PL several H-induced radiative transitions are observed, with the dominant \u2026",

The structural features of the stacking faults were determined by diffraction-contrast transmission electron microscopy, while the optical emission characteristics were observed by highly spatially resolved monochromatic cathodoluminescence. The studies were performed in the exact same regions of thinned foils. We find that stacking faults on the basal plane are responsible for the strong emission at \u223c3.14eV. Luminescence peaks at \u223c3.33 and \u223c3.29eV are associated with the presence of stacking faults on prismatic a planes and partial dislocations at the stacking fault boundaries, respectively.",

With a sideview transmission electron microscopy technique, the oxidation progression of Si nanowires was characterized over a range of temperature from 800 to 1200\u2009\u00b0C. A previously reported self\u2010limiting oxidation phenomenon was found to occur only for oxidation temperatures below 950\u2009\u00b0C.

            "The polarity of the lattice of bulk single GaN crystals and the polarity of homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial\u2010on\u2010sapphire GaN thin films has been studied using convergent beam electron diffraction. Diffraction patterns obtained at 200 kV for the <1\u2013100> projection of GaN were matched with calculated patterns. The lattice orientations of two commonly observed bulk single\u2010crystal facets were identified. It is shown that the smooth facets in single crystals correspond to the (0001), Ga\u2010terminated, lattice planes, whereas the rough facets correspond to the (0001\u0304), N\u2010terminated, planes. It is also shown that metalorganic chemical vapor deposition epitaxy retains the polarity of the substrate, i.e., no inversion boundaries were observed. Heteroepitaxy on sapphire is shown to grow in the (0001), Ga\u2010terminated orientation.",

            "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence (CL) have been used to determine the influence of edge and screw dislocations on the light emitting properties of InxGa1\u2212xN quantum wells. TEM is used to locate and identify the nature of dislocations. CL on the same samples is used to determine the spatial variation of the luminescence. A direct correlation of CL maps with TEM has been established, showing that threading edge dislocations act as nonradiative recombination centers with an associated minority carrier diffusion length of 200 nm. Threading dislocations of screw and mixed type were found to be associated with surface pits which were also nonradiative in the quantum well (QW) emission, but owing to the absence of QW growth on the pit facets. The contributions of edge and screw\/mixed dislocations to the reduction of the QW emission are quantified \u2026",

The films were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, using AlN buffer layers. X\u2010ray diffraction measurements show negligible strain in the epilayer, and a long\u2010range variation in orientation. Transmission electron lattice images show that the AlN buffer layer consists of small crystallites. The nature of the buffer layer and its interfaces with the substrate and the GaN film is discussed. The defect structure of the GaN film away from the substrate consists mostly of threading dislocations with a density of \u223c109 cm\u22122.",
