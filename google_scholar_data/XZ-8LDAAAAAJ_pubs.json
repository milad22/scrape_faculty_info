            "Diffusivity is a key quantity in describing velocity fluctuations in granular materials. These fluctuations are the basis of many thermodynamic and hydrodynamic models which aim to provide a statistical description of granular systems. We present experimental results on diffusivity in dense, granular shear flows in a two-dimensional Couette geometry. We find that self-diffusivities D are proportional to the local shear rate \u03b3 \u0307 with diffusivities along the direction of the mean flow approximately twice as large as those in the perpendicular direction. The magnitude of the diffusivity is D\u2248 \u03b3 \u0307 a 2, where a is the particle radius. However, the gradient in shear rate, coupling to the mean flow, and strong drag at the moving boundary lead to particle displacements that can appear subdiffusive or superdiffusive. In particular, diffusion appears to be superdiffusive along the mean flow direction due to Taylor dispersion effects and \u2026",

The observed growth morphologies are very sensitive to small anisotropies in surface tension caused by misorientations from the {111} plane. Different seaweed morphologies are found, including the degenerate, the stabilized, and the strongly tilted seaweeds. The degenerate seaweeds show a limited fractal scaling range and, with increased undercooling, suggests a transition from \u201cfractal\u201d to \u201ccompact\u201d seaweed.

The approach to steady-state behavior depends on the history of the packing and the existing force and contact network. We present experiments on shearing of dense granular matter in a 2D Couette geometry in which we probe the history and evolution of shear bands by measuring particle trajectories and stresses during transients. We find that when shearing is stopped and restarted in the same direction, steady-state behavior is immediately reached, in agreement with the typical assumption that the system is quasistatic. Although some relaxation of the force network is observed when shearing is stopped, quasistatic behavior is maintained because the contact network remains essentially unchanged. When the direction of shear is reversed, a transient occurs in which stresses initially decrease, changes in the force \u2026",

Low anisotropy growth is achieved by selecting a grain near the {111} plane leading to either seaweed (dense branching morphology) or doublon growth depending on experimental parameters. We find selection of doublons to be strongly dependent on solute concentration and sample orientation.

Broadening the spectrum of the usable electromagnetic spectrum would greatly contribute to the renewable and sustainable energy sources available to humankind. In particular, low frequency and low power radiation is important for applications on ships, satellites, cars, personal backpacks, and, more generally, where non-dangerous energy is needed at all hours of the day, independent of weather conditions. In this work, we identify an electric and an entropic contribution to the energy transfer from low power infrared radiation to the power generator device, representing electrical and thermal contributions to the power generation. The electric contribution prevails, and is important because it offers multiple ways to increase the voltage produced. For example, placing black-colored gaffer tape on the illuminated face doubles the voltage produced, while the temperature difference, thus the entropic contribution, is not sensitive to the presence of the tape. We recognize the electric contribution through the fast changes it imparts to the voltage output of the power generator device, which mirror the instabilities in time of the infrared radiation. The device thus acts as sensor of the infrared radiation\u2019s behavior in time. On the other hand, we distinguish the entropic contribution through the slow changes it causes to the voltage output of the power generator device, which reflect the relative delay with which the two faces of the device respond to thermal perturbations.",
