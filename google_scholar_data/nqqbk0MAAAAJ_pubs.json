For the underdoped compositions of this cuprate (x\u223c 0.13) we observe a peak in the conductance-voltage characteristics of the point contact junctions. The shape and magnitude of this peak suggest the presence of Andreev bound states at the surface of underdoped PCCO which is evidence for a d-wave pairing symmetry. For overdoped PCCO (x\u223c 0.17) the PCS data do not show any evidence of Andreev bound states at the surface suggesting an s-wave pairing symmetry.",

            "Optical metamaterials have redefined how we understand light in notable ways: from strong response to optical magnetic fields, negative refraction, fast and slow light propagation in zero index and trapping structures, to flat, thin and perfect lenses. Many rules of thumb regarding optics, such as \u03bc= 1, now have an exception, and basic formulas, such as the Fresnel equations, have been expanded. The field of metamaterials has developed strongly over the past two decades. Leveraging structured materials systems to generate tailored response to a stimulus, it has grown to encompass research in optics, electromagnetics, acoustics and, increasingly, novel hybrid material responses. This roadmap is an effort to present emerging fronts in areas of optical metamaterials that could contribute and apply to other research communities. By anchoring each contribution in current work and prospectively discussing future \u2026",

            "Thin films of Ag-added La2\/3Ca1\/3MnO3 exhibit enhancement of several desirable characteristics over the pristine counterparts. We find that the addition of Ag results in a pronounced increase in the insulator\u2013metal transition temperature (Tp) and ferromagnetic transition temperature (Tc). There is also a remarkable improvement in the magnetic and electrical homogeneity of the samples as indicated by narrower ferromagnetic resonance linewidths and narrower resistive transitions, respectively. The observed improvement in properties is inferred to be largely associated with improved oxygen stoichiometry of the films although microstructural effects are not ruled out.",
