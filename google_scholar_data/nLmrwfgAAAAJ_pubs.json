            "The ability to grow extra nodes is a potentially useful facility for a self-organising neural network. A network that can add nodes into its map space can approximate the input space more accurately, and often more parsimoniously, than a network with predefined structure and size, such as the Self-Organising Map. In addition, a growing network can deal with dynamic input distributions. Most of the growing networks that have been proposed in the literature add new nodes to support the node that has accumulated the highest error during previous iterations or to support topological structures. This usually means that new nodes are added only when the number of iterations is an integer multiple of some pre-defined constant, \u03bb.This paper suggests a way in which the learning algorithm can add nodes whenever the network in its current state does not sufficiently match the input. In this way the network grows very quickly \u2026",

The formalism can also be applied to other population based search techniques and to biological models of micro-evolution. To make the problem tractable, it is assumed that the population dynamics can be described by a few macroscopic order parameters and that the remaining microscopic degrees of freedom can be averaged out. The macroscopic quantities that are used are the cumulants of the distribution of fitnesses (or energies) in the population. A statistical mechanics model is presented which describes the population configuration in terms of the cumulants, this is used to derive equations of motion for the cumulants \u2026",

A robot can travel through environments that humans cannot, and can be trained to identify sensor perceptions that signify potential or actual problems without requiring human intervention. However, in many cases, the appearance of a problem can vary widely, and ensuring that the robot does not miss any possible appearance of the problem (false negatives) is virtually impossible using conventional methods.This paper presents an alternative methodology using novelty detection. A neural network is trained to ignore normal perceptions that do not suggest any problems, so that anything that the robot has not sensed before is highlighted as a possible fault. This makes the incidence of false negatives less likely.We propose a novelty filter that can operate on-line, so that each new input is evaluated for novelty with respect to the data seen so far.
