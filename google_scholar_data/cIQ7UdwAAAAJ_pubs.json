            "Flux couplings to string theory axions yield super-Planckian field ranges along which the axion potential energy grows. At the same time, other aspects of the physics remain essentially unchanged along these large displacements, respecting a discrete shift symmetry with a sub-Planckian period. After a general overview of this monodromy effect and its application to large-field inflation, we present new classes of specific models of monodromy inflation, with monomial potentials \u03bc 4\u2212 p \u03d5 p. A key simplification in these models is that the inflaton potential energy plays a leading role in moduli stabilization during inflation. The resulting inflaton-dependent shifts in the moduli fields lead to an effective flattening of the inflaton potential, ie a reduction of the exponent from a fiducial value p 0 to p< p 0. We focus on examples arising in compactifications of type IIB string theory on products of tori or Riemann surfaces, where the \u2026",

These compactifications give rise to effective 4D Script N= 1 supergravity theories that do not fall under some recently-proven no-go theorems against de Sitter vacua and slow-roll inflation. Focusing on a well-understood class of models based on coset spaces, however, we can use a refined no-go theorem that rules out de Sitter vacua and slow-roll inflation in all but one case. The refined no-go theorem uses the dilaton and a specific linear combination of the K\u00e4hler moduli, which is different from the overall volume modulus. It puts a lower bound on the first slow-roll parameter: epsilon\u2265 2.

The first step in this direction was explained in [1, 2]: it was shown there that in the GKP background the bosonic contributions to the vacuum energy from the DBI and WZ term cancel for a D3 brane, but double for a brane, leading to de Sitter vacua. The next step was taken in [3] where the analogous mechanism of the doubling (cancelation) of the(D3) DBI and WZ terms was discovered in the presence of Volkov-Akulov fermions living on the brane, in a flat supergravity background. Here we confirm this mechanism of doubling\/cancelation for the\/D3 brane in the GKP supergravity background preserving= 1, d= 4 supersymmetry.

Here we show how this term can arise via spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry, based on the emergence of a nilpotent chiral supermultiplet on the world-volume of the anti-D3-brane. We establish and use the fact that both the DBI as well as the WZ term, with account of orientifolding, acquire a form of the Volkov-Akulov action. For an O3 orientifold involution of \u211d 9, 1 we demonstrate the cancellation between the fermionic parts of the DBI and WZ term for the D3-brane action. For the anti-D3-brane we show that the DBI action and the WZ action combine and lead to the emergence of the goldstino multiplet which is responsible for spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry.

First we consider two sets of BPS solutions that both relate to the GKP solution through T-dualities:(p+ 1)-dimensional solutions from spacetime-filling Op-planes with a conformally Ricci-flat internal space, and p-dimensional solutions with Op-planes that wrap a 1-cycle inside an everywhere negatively curved twisted torus. The relation between the solution with smeared orientifolds and the localised version is worked out in detail. We then demonstrate that a class of non-BPS AdS 4 solutions that exist for IASD fluxes and with smeared D3branes (or analogously for ISD fluxes with anti-D3-branes) does not survive the localisation of the (anti) D3-branes.
