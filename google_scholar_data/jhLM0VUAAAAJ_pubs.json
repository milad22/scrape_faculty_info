We pay close attention to the nonperturbative spin-independent Sudakov factor in the evolution formalism and find a universal form which can describe reasonably well the experimental data on the transverse momentum distributions in SIDIS, DY lepton pair and W\/Z production. With this Sudakov factor at hand, we perform a global fitting of all the experimental data on the Sivers asymmetry in SIDIS from HERMES, COMPASS and Jefferson Lab. We then make predictions for the Sivers asymmetry in DY lepton pair and W production that can be compared to the future experimental measurements to test the sign change of the Sivers functions between SIDIS and DY processes and constrain the sea quark Sivers functions.",

The two functions have been extracted from data for single-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and in single-inclusive hadron production in p p collisions, respectively. Performing a consistent comparison of the extracted functions, we find that they show a \u201csign mismatch\u201d: while the magnitude of the functions is roughly consistent, the k\u22a5 moment of the Sivers function has opposite sign from that of T q, F (x, x), both for up and for down quarks.

The principal aim of the program was to develop and sharpen the science case for an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), a facility that will be able to collide electrons and positrons with polarized protons and with light to heavy nuclei at high energies, offering unprecedented possibilities for in-depth studies of quantum chromodynamics. This report is organized around four major themes: i) the spin and flavor structure of the proton, ii) three-dimensional structure of nucleons and nuclei in momentum and configuration space, iii) QCD matter in nuclei, and iv) Electroweak physics and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. Beginning with an executive summary, the report contains tables of key measurements, chapter overviews for each of the major scientific themes, and detailed individual contributions on various aspects of the scientific opportunities presented by an EIC.",

We show how this approach, based on the generalization of the DGLAP evolution equations to include final-state medium-induced parton shower corrections for large Q 2 processes, can be combined with initial-state effects for applications to jet quenching phenomenology. We demonstrate that the traditional parton energy loss calculations can be regarded as a special soft-gluon emission limit of the general QCD evolution framework. We present phenomenological comparison of the SCET G-based results on the suppression of inclusive charged hadron and neutral pion production in s NN= 2.76 TeV lead-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider to experimental data.

            "We present a perturbative QCD factorization formalism for the production of heavy quarkonia of large transverse momentum p T at collider energies, which includes both the leading-power (LP) and next-to-leading-power (NLP) contributions to the cross section in the m Q 2\/p T 2 expansion for heavy quark mass m Q. We estimate fragmentation functions in the nonrelativistic QCD formalism and reproduce the bulk of the large enhancement found in explicit next-to-leading-order calculations in the color-singlet model. Heavy quarkonia produced from NLP channels prefer longitudinal polarization.",
