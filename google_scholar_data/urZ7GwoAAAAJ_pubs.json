            "Wave dark matter (\u03c8 DM), which satisfies the Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson equation, has recently attracted substantial attention as a possible dark matter candidate. Numerical simulations have, in the past, provided a powerful tool to explore this new territory of possibility. Despite their successes in revealing several key features of \u03c8 DM, further progress in simulations is limited, in that cosmological simulations so far can only address formation of halos below\u223c 2\u00d7 10 11 M\u2299 and substantially more massive halos have become computationally very challenging to obtain. For this reason, the present work adopts a different approach in assessing massive halos by constructing wave-halo solutions directly from the wave distribution function. This approach bears certain similarities with the analytical construction of the particle-halo (cold dark matter model). Instead of many collisionless particles, one deals with one single wave \u2026",
