            "A through analysis is made of the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T c on material properties (\u03bb, \u03bc*, phonon spectrum) as contained in Eliashberg theory. The most striking new feature of the analysis is in the asymptotic regime of very large \u03bb where T c is found to equal 0.15 (\u03bb< \u03c9 2>) 1 2 (assuming \u03bc*= 0.1). This result implies the surprising conclusion that within Eliashberg theory T c is not limited by the phonon frequencies, and also shows that McMillan's\" \u03bb= 2 limit\" is spurious. The McMillan equation (with a prefactor altered from \u0398 D 1.45 to \u03c9 log 1.2) is found to be highly accurate for all known materials with \u03bb< 1.5 but in error for large values of \u03bb. Correction factors to McMillan's equation are found in terms of \u03bb, \u03bc*, and one additional parameter,(< \u03c9 2>) 1 2 \u03c9 log. The frequency \u03c9 log is defined as exp< ln \u03c9> where the averages< ln \u03c9> and< \u03c9 2> are defined using (2 \u03bb \u03c9) \u03b1 2 F (\u03c9) as a \u2026",

We show that for both models the conductance\u2010voltage plot is roughly parabolic at low voltages (\u22720.4\u2009V). The minimum conductance is not at zero bias unless the barrier is symmetrical and identical Fermi energies are chosen for the two metal electrodes. The inclusion of image forces does not radically alter the shape of the conductance\u2010voltage dependence. Using reasonable barrier shapes, the asymmetry of the calculated conductance about V=0 is not as large as we frequently observe experimentally. We point out that this extreme asymmetry appears to be associated with the presence of organic impurities in the oxide layer of the junction.",

One approach to obtain this control is through multiferroic materials. Instead of using direct coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order parameters in a single-phase multiferroic material, which only shows a weak magnetoelectric effect, a unique method using indirect coupling through an intermediate antiferromagnetic order parameter can be used. In this article, we demonstrate electrical control of exchange bias using a field-effect device employing multiferroic (ferroelectric\/antiferromagnetic) BiFeO 3 as the dielectric and ferromagnetic La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 as the conducting channel; we can reversibly switch between two distinct exchange-bias states by switching the ferroelectric polarization of BiFeO 3.
