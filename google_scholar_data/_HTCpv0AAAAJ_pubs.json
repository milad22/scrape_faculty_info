            "The D\u00d8 experiment enjoyed a very successful data-collection run at the Fermilab Tevatron collider between 1992 and 1996. Since then, the detector has been upgraded to take advantage of improvements to the Tevatron and to enhance its physics capabilities. We describe the new elements of the detector, including the silicon microstrip tracker, central fiber tracker, solenoidal magnet, preshower detectors, forward muon detector, and forward proton detector. The uranium\/liquid-argon calorimeters and central muon detector, remaining from Run I, are discussed briefly. We also present the associated electronics, triggering, and data acquisition systems, along with the design and implementation of software specific to D\u00d8.",

            "The measurement of the inclusive differential cross sections for 1S production published in our recent Letter [1] requires a correction for an increase in the reported integrated luminosity. The instantaneous luminosity at D0 is measured by counting the number of inelastic collisions that produce charged particles within the acceptance of the luminosity monitor [2]. The determination of the luminosity has recently been improved through studies of the multiplicities observed in the luminosity monitor [3]. These studies indicated that the fraction of observable inelastic collisions was overestimated in our previous analysis [4]. The result of these improvements is to increase the assessment of the total integrated luminosity for this analysis by 16.5% to 185 11 pb 1 and to decrease the estimated uncertainty from 6.5% to 6.1%. The recalculated cross sections are shown in Table I.",

We use 370 pb\u2212 1 of data collected by the D0 experiment and select events with at least one high transverse momentum electron or muon, high transverse energy imbalance, and four or more jets. We discriminate between b-and b-quark jets by using the charge and momenta of tracks within the jet cones. The data are consistent with the expected electric charge,| q|= 2 e\/3. We exclude, at the 92% CL, that the sample is solely due to the production of exotic quark pairs Q Q with| q|= 4 e\/3.
