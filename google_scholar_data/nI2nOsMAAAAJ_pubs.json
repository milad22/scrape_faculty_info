The experimental results were obtained by subtracting known cross sections from the measured data obtained with a pyrolyzed mixed beam containing a variety of atomic and molecular species. The calculations were performed using both a fully relativistic Dirac B-spline R-matrix (close-coupling) method and an optical model potential approach. Given the difficulty of the problem, the agreement between the two sets of theoretical predictions and the experimental data for the angle-differential and the angle-integrated elastic cross sections at 40 eV and 50 eV is satisfactory.",

We show that applying a noisy matrix U \u0303 that is within \u03b5 of the desired matrix U in operator norm leads to an output distribution that is within \u03b5 n of the desired distribution in variation distance, where n is the number of photons. This lets us derive a sufficient tolerance for beam splitters and phase shifters in the network. This result only concerns errors that result from the network encoding a different unitary than desired and not from other sources of noise such as photon loss and partial distinguishability.",

The measurements employ a thin-aperture version of the relative-flow method, while the calculations employ the Schwinger multichannel method with an extensive treatment of polarization effects. Comparisons with earlier results, both experimental and theoretical, are presented and discussed.

The experimental results are compared with three calculations: a convergent close-coupling calculation, a distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) calculation with inclusion of the Gamow factor, and a hybrid DWBA+ R-matrix calculation. The comparison between the experimental and theoretical results highlights the importance of the description of postcollision interaction, and the results exhibit interesting orbital-dependent differences.",
