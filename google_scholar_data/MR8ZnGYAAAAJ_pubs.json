            "Floquet topological insulators are noninteracting quantum systems that, when driven by a time-periodic field, are described by effective Hamiltonians whose bands carry nontrivial topological invariants. A longstanding question concerns the possibility of selectively populating one of these effective bands, thereby maximizing the system's resemblance to a static topological insulator. We study such Floquet systems coupled to a zero-temperature thermal reservoir that provides dissipation. We find that the resulting electronic steady states are generically characterized by a finite density of excitations above the effective ground state, even when the driving has a small amplitude and\/or large frequency. We discuss the role of reservoir engineering in mitigating this problem.",

In this Letter we give a striking theoretical example of such materials design: a tunable gap in monolayer graphene is generated by exciting a particular optical phonon. We show that the system reaches a steady state whose transport properties are the same as if the system had a static electronic gap, controllable by the driving amplitude. Moreover, the steady state displays topological phenomena: there are chiral edge currents, which circulate a fractional charge e\/2 per rotation cycle, with the frequency set by the optical phonon frequency.",

Namely, they exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy and spatiotemporal long-range order, both believed to be impossible in typical highly excited eigenstates of nonintegrable quantum many-body systems. While generic initial states are expected to thermalize, we show analytically that the eigenstates we construct lead to weak ergodicity breaking in the form of persistent oscillations of local observables following certain quantum quenches\u2014in other words, these eigenstates provide an archetypal example of so-called quantum many-body scars.

In the experiment, long-lived coherent many-body oscillations were observed only when the system was initialized in a particular product state. This pronounced coherence has been attributed to the presence of special \u201cscarred\u201d eigenstates with nearly equally spaced energies and putative nonergodic properties despite their finite energy density. In this paper we uncover a surprising connection between these scarred eigenstates and low-lying quasiparticle excitations of the spin chain. In particular, we show that these eigenstates can be accurately captured by a set of variational states containing a macroscopic number of magnons with momentum \u03c0. This leads to an interpretation of the scarred eigenstates as finite-energy-density condensates of weakly interacting \u03c0 \u2026",

These states provide a new solvable example of quantum many-body scars: their sub-volume-law entanglement and equal energy spacing allow for infinitely long-lived coherent oscillations of local observables following a suitable quantum quench. While previous works on scars have interpreted such oscillations in terms of the precession of an emergent macroscopic SU (2) spin, the present model evades this description due to a set of emergent kinetic constraints in the scarred eigenstates that are absent in the underlying Hamiltonian. We also analyze the set of initial states that give rise to periodic revivals, which persist as approximate revivals on a finite timescale when the underlying model is perturbed.

We demonstrate that, even for noninteracting systems, effective equilibration to the grand canonical ensemble requires both fine tuning the system-bath coupling and selecting a sufficiently simple driving protocol. We study a tractable subclass of these problems in which the long-time steady state of the system can be determined analytically, and demonstrate that the system effectively thermalizes with fine tuning, but does not thermalize for general values of the system-bath couplings. When the driven system does not thermalize, it supports a tunable persistent current in the steady state without external bias. We compute \u2026",

They can exhibit Anderson localization with area-law eigenstate entanglement or, surprisingly, ballistic transport at any disorder strength.

Light traveling inside spatially well-separated topological guided modes can be braided, leading to the accumulation of non-Abelian phases, which depend on the order in which the guided beams are wound around one another.
