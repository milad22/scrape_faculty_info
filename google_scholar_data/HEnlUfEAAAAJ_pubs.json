            "Organic (opto)electronic materials have received considerable attention due to their applications in thin-film-transistors, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, sensors, photorefractive devices, and many others. The technological promises include low cost of these materials and the possibility of their room-temperature deposition from solution on large-area and\/or flexible substrates. The article reviews the current understanding of the physical mechanisms that determine the (opto)electronic properties of high-performance organic materials. The focus of the review is on photoinduced processes and on electronic properties important for optoelectronic applications relying on charge carrier photogeneration. Additionally, it highlights the capabilities of various experimental techniques for characterization of these materials, summarizes top-of-the-line device performance, and outlines recent trends in the further development of \u2026",

            "For many years, considerable research efforts have been directed toward exploring the interaction between light and matter for the prospective replacement of electronic devices with faster, more sensitive, and more reliable optical devices. Therefore, materials whose optical properties are sensitive to light, including nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, have attracted attention. An important subset of NLO materials are materials that exhibit the photorefractive (PR) effect, or PR materials. The PR effect refers to spatial modulation of the index of refraction under nonuniform illumination via space-charge-field formation and electro-optic nonlinearity. The effect arises when charge carriers, photogenerated by a spatially modulated light intensity, separate by drift and\/or diffusion processes and become trapped to produce a nonuniform space-charge distribution. The resulting internal space-charge electric field then modulates \u2026",

Dependencies of the dynamics on charge generation, mobility, trap density, acceptor density, ionized acceptor density, as well as their associated rates are examined.

Organic materials are attractive due to their low cost, the possibility of their deposition from solution onto large-area substrates, and the ability to tailor their properties. The Handbook of organic materials for optical and (opto) electronic devices provides an overview of the properties of organic optoelectronic and nonlinear optical materials, and explains how these materials can be used across a range of applications. Parts one and two explore the materials used for organic optoelectronics and nonlinear optics, their properties, and methods of their characterization illustrated by physical studies. Part three moves on to discuss the applications of optoelectronic and nonlinear optical organic materials in devices and includes chapters on organic solar cells, electronic memory devices, and electronic chemical sensors, electro-optic devices. The Handbook of organic materials for optical and (opto) electronic devices is a technical resource for physicists, chemists, electrical engineers and materials scientists involved in research and development of organic semiconductor and nonlinear optical materials and devices. Comprehensively examines the properties of organic optoelectronic and nonlinear optical materials Discusses their applications in different devices including solar cells, LEDs and electronic memory devices An essential technical resource for physicists, chemists, electrical \u2026",
