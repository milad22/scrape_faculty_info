The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",

            "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",

The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb\u2212 1 and 20.3 fb\u2212 1 at centre-of-mass energies of TeV and TeV respectively. All combinations of leptonic ( with \u2113= e, \u03bc) and hadronic (\u03c4\u2192 hadrons \u03bd) tau decays are considered. An excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.5 (3.4) standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the direct coupling of the recently discovered Higgs boson to fermions. The measured signal strength, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, of \u03bc= 1. 43\u2212 0.37+ 0.43 is consistent with the predicted Yukawa coupling strength in the Standard Model.",

            "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton\u2013proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s\u221a=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson, for  20\u2264pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |\u03b7|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |\u03b7|<1.2 ) for jets with  55\u2264pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |\u03b7|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating \u2026",

The reconstruction efficiency is measured to be close to  over most of the covered phase space ( and  GeV). The isolation efficiency varies between 93 and  depending on the selection applied and on the momentum of the muon. Both efficiencies are well reproduced in simulation.
