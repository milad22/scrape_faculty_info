The charge carrier density is as high as 2\u00d7 10 9 cm\u2212 3, and the temperatures of electrons and ions are as low as 100 mK and 10 \u03bc K, respectively. Plasma behavior is evident in the trapping of electrons by the positive ion cloud when the Debye screening length becomes smaller than the size of the sample. We produce plasmas with parameters such that both electrons and ions are strongly coupled.",

Up to 20% of the initially free charges recombine in about 100 \u03bc s, and the binding energy of the Rydberg atoms approximately equals the increase in the kinetic energy of the remaining free electrons. Three-body recombination is expected to dominate in this regime, yet most of our results are inconsistent with this mechanism.",

With this collective mode we probe the electron density distribution and study the expansion of the plasma as a function of time. For classical plasma conditions, ie, weak Coulomb coupling, the expansion is dominated by the pressure of the electron gas and is described by a hydrodynamic model. Discrepancies between the model and observations at low temperature and high density may be due to strong coupling of the electrons.",
