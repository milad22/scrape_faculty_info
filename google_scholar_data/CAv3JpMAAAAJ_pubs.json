            "Active learning has received great interests from researchers due to its ability to reduce the amount of supervision required for effective learning. As the core component of active learning algorithms, query synthesis and pool-based sampling are two main scenarios of querying considered in the literature. Query synthesis features low querying time, but only has limited applications as the synthesized query might be unrecognizable to human oracle. As a result, most efforts have focused on pool-based sampling in recent years, although it is much more time-consuming. In this paper, we propose new strategies for a novel querying framework that combines query synthesis and pool-based sampling. It overcomes the limitation of query synthesis, and has the advantage of fast querying. The basic idea is to synthesize an instance close to the decision boundary using labelled data, and then select the real instance closest \u2026",

            "Visual learning problems, such as object classification and action recognition, are typically approached using extensions of the popular bag-of-words (BoWs) model. Despite its great success, it is unclear what visual features the BoW model is learning. Which regions in the image or video are used to discriminate among classes? Which are the most discriminative visual words? Answering these questions is fundamental for understanding existing BoW models and inspiring better models for visual recognition. To answer these questions, this paper presents a method for feature selection and region selection in the visual BoW model. This allows for an intermediate visualization of the features and regions that are important for visual learning. The main idea is to assign latent weights to the features or regions, and jointly optimize these latent variables with the parameters of a classifier (e.g., support vector machine \u2026",

            "In this paper, we aim at irregular-shape object localization under weak supervision. With over-segmentation, this task can be transformed into multiple-instance context. However, most multiple-instance learning methods only emphasize single most positive instance in a positive bag to optimize bag-level classification, and leads to imprecise or incomplete localization. To address this issue, we propose a scheme for instance annotation, where all of the positive instances are detected by labeling each instance in each positive bag. Inspired by the successful application of bag-of-words (BoW) to feature representation, we leverage it at instance-level to model the distributions of the positive class and negative class, and then incorporate the BoW learning and instance labeling in a single optimization formulation. We also demonstrate that the scheme is well suited to weakly supervised object localization of irregular \u2026",

Active learning aims to address this problem by asking queries in a smart way. Two main scenarios of querying considered in the literature are query synthesis and pool-based sampling. Since in many cases synthesized queries are meaningless or difficult for human to label, more efforts have been devoted to pool-based sampling in recent years. However, in pool-based active learning, querying requires evaluating every unlabeled data point in the pool, which is usually very time-consuming. By contrast, query synthesis has clear advantage on querying time, which is independent of the pool size. In this paper, we propose a novel framework combining query synthesis and pool-based sampling to accelerate the learning \u2026",

            "In this paper, we investigate the problem of weakly supervised object localization in images. For such a problem, the goal is to predict the locations of objects in test images while the labels of the training images are given at image-level. That means a label only indicates whether an image contains objects or not, but does not provide the exact locations of the objects. We propose to address this problem using Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW). Specifically, we first train a linear SVM classifier with the weakly labeled data. Based on bag-of-words feature representation, the response of a region to the linear SVM classifier can be formulated as the sum of the feature-weights within the region. For a test image, by properly constructing a graph on the feature-points, the stationary distribution of a MERW can indicate the region with the densest positive feature-weights, and thus provides a probabilistic object \u2026",

Most existing methods exploit temporal structure only in a fixed scale or implicit multiple scales. Although recently some methods attempt towards exploiting the temporal structure and relationship by using the durations of action primitives, they cannot effectively conduct the action recognition and discriminative segments discovery simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel action recognition method, named Latent Duration Model (LDM), which is a temporal variant of Deformable Part Model (DPM) with explicit durations and temporal ordering constraints. Three types of latent variables are introduced into LDM. Latent duration variables are used to accommodate intra-class temporal scale variation.

However, an arbitrary-shape detector usually requires pixel-level human annotation, which is very expensive and hardly afforded for any real-world application. On the other hand, bounding-box is much easier than pixel-wise segmentation in human labeling. In this paper we aim to realize the arbitrary-shape detection from bounding-box human annotation. To this end, we propose location positiveness, which encodes the information of bounding-box annotation to help obtain region annotation. In addition, we propose two graph-based methods to embed the location positiveness, which enable more accurate model trained from simpler annotation.
