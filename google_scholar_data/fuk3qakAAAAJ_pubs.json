            "Organic semiconductors are emerging as a viable alternative to amorphous silicon in a range of thin\u2010film transistor devices. With the possibility to formulate these p\u2010type materials as inks and subsequently print into patterned devices, organic\u2010based transistors offer significant commercial advantages for manufacture, with initial applications such as low performance displays and simple logic being envisaged. Previous limitations of both air stability and electrical performance are now being overcome with a range of both small molecule and polymer\u2010based solution\u2010processable materials, which achieve charge carrier mobilities in excess of 0.5\u2009cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, a benchmark value for amorphous silicon semiconductors.

            "Synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) have been used to study the interaction of NO2 with polycrystalline surfaces of metallic zinc and zinc oxide. NO2 exhibits a complex chemistry on metallic zinc. After adsorbing nitrogen dioxide, N, O, NO, NO2, and NO3 are present on the surface of the metal. At room temperature the NO2 molecule mainly dissociates into O adatoms and gaseous NO, whereas at low temperatures (<250 K) chemisorbed NO2 and NO3 dominate on the surface. NO2 is a very good oxidizing agent for preparing ZnO from metallic zinc. Zn reacts more vigorously with NO2 than metals, such as Rh, Pd, or Pt which are typical catalysts for the removal of NOx molecules (DeNOx process). At 300 K, the main product of the reaction of NO2 with polycrystalline ZnO is adsorbed NO3 with little NO2 or NO present on the surface of the oxide. No \u2026",

Spectroscopy, diffraction, and microscopy measurements reveal a transition in molecular packing behavior from a preferentially edge-on orientation of the conjugated plane to a preferentially face-on orientation as the attachment density of the side chains increases. Thermal annealing generally reduces both the face-on population and the misoriented edge-on domains. The highest hole mobilities of this series were obtained from edge-on molecular packing and in-plane liquid-crystalline texture, but films with a bimodal orientation distribution and no discernible in-plane texture exhibited surprisingly comparable mobilities.

Here we show that carbon and nitrogen core-level resonant X-ray spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of chemical bonding and electronic structure of chemical dopants introduced in single-sheet graphene films. In conjunction with density functional theory based calculations, we are able to obtain a detailed picture of bond types and electronic structure in graphene doped with nitrogen at the sub-percent level. We show that different N-bond types, including graphitic, pyridinic, and nitrilic, can exist in a single, dilutely N-doped graphene sheet. We show that these various bond types have profoundly different effects on the carrier concentration, indicating that control over the dopant bond type is a crucial \u2026",

The surface-active polymer, obtained by grafting fluorinated molecules with hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks to a block copolymer precursor, showed interesting bioadhesion properties. Two different algal species, one of which adhered strongly to hydrophobic surfaces, and the other, to hydrophilic surfaces, showed notably weak adhesion to the amphiphilic surfaces. Both organisms are known to secrete adhesive macromolecules, with apparently different wetting characteristics, to attach to underwater surfaces. The ability of the amphiphilic surface to undergo an environment-dependent transformation in surface chemistry when in contact with the extracellular polymeric substances is a possible reason for its antifouling nature.

Side-chain interdigitation provides a mechanism for three-dimensional ordering; without it, poly(alkylthiophenes) are limited to small domains and poor performance.

The metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Li-ion deintercalation is achieved by the oxidation of Ni2+ ions, while the manganese ions and the cobalt ions remain mostly unchanged in the Mn4+ and Co3+ state. These conclusions are in good agreement with the results of the metal K-edge EXAFS data.

            "THERE is a considerable demand for materials that have surfaces to which other substances will not easily stick. Coatings with these properties might be used to make surfaces non-adhesive towards soil, ice, biological foulants, graffiti and other unwanted contaminants. Here we describe a class of water-based non-stick coatings prepared by self-assembly and immobilization of reactive polymeric surfactants 1, 2. These polymer surfactants contain pendant perfluoroalkyl groups which become oriented so as to yield surfaces with very low energy. Immobilization by crosslinking increases non-stick performance and film toughness. These hard, clear coatings release adhesives and cannot be wetted or attacked by solvents.",
