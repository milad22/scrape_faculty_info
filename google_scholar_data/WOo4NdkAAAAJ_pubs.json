            "The cytokines SDF\u20101\u03b1 and \u20101\u03b2 are two alternatively spliced variants of the CXC (\u03b1) chemokines that are highly conserved among species. SDF\u20101\u03b1 was shown to function as a B\u2010cell maturation factor, a ligand for the CXCR4 (LESTR\/fusin) chemokine receptor, thereby inhibiting replication of T cell\u2010tropic HIV\u20101 strains and inducing cell death in human neuronal cell lines. In this report the cloning of the rat SDF\u20101\u03b2 cDNA and a new SDF\u20101 isoform, SDF\u20101\u03b3, are presented. Using Northern blot analysis, the expression pattern of both isoforms was studied in different tissues and it is shown that during postnatal development of the central and peripheral nervous system SDF\u20101\u03b2\u2010 and SDF\u20101\u03b3\u2010mRNA expression is inversely regulated. Whilst SDF\u20101\u03b2\u2010mRNA is the predominant isoform in embryonic and early postnatal nerve tissue, SDF\u20101\u03b3\u2010mRNA is expressed at higher levels in adulthood.

            "One of the most striking features of the injured mature peripheral nervous system is the ability to regenerate. The lesioned peripheral nervous system displays stereotypic histopathological reactions indicating the activation of a co\u2010ordinated lesion\u2010induced gene expression programme. Previous research has already identified molecular components of this axonal switch from a mature transmitting to a regenerative growth mode. The observed alterations in gene expression within the lesioned distal nerve stump were largely attributed to recapitulated developmental processes. However, to our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been proven systematically. Most of the stereotypic molecular and cellular reactions during nerve development and repair can be assigned to specific time windows.

On the other hand, neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), including retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons, are incapable of spontaneous regeneration. In the adult PNS, axonal regeneration after injury depends on well-orchestrated cellular and molecular processes that comprise a highly reproducible series of degenerative reactions distal to the site of injury. During this fine-tuned process, named Wallerian degeneration, a remodeling of the distal nerve fragment prepares a permissive microenvironment that permits successful axonal regrowth originating from the proximal nerve fragment. Therefore, a multitude of adjusted intrinsic and extrinsic factors are important for surviving neurons, Schwann cells, macrophages and fibroblasts as well as \u2026",

A subpopulation of nonmyelinating Schwann cells in the adult sciatic nerve retains expression of AN2. In rat sciatic nerve crushes, where Schwann cell numbers increase after initial axonal loss and markers of immature Schwann cells show an upregulation, no increased expression of AN2 was observed. In contrast, AN2 expression was upregulated in nerves from peripheral myelin protein-22-transgenic rats, where immature Schwann cells expand without axonal loss. Furthermore, coculture with neurons upregulated AN2 expression on Schwann cells in vitro.

Here, we report that treatment with SDF-1\u03b1 is sufficient to overcome neurite outgrowth inhibition mediated by CNS myelin towards cultured postnatal dorsal root ganglion neurons. While we found both cognate SDF-1 receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7\/RDC1, to be coexpressed on myelin-sensitive dorsal root ganglion neurons, the distinct expression pattern of CXCR4 on growth cones and branching points of neurites suggests a function of this receptor in chemokine-mediated growth promotion and\/or arborization.

The new Cx32 5'UTR sequence detected in the sciatic nerve cDNA clones is identical to one previously found in the 6.5 kb intron of the murine Cx32 gene. Using primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analysis, we determined the transcriptional starting point of this new alternative Cx32 transcript expressed in the sciatic nerve. This starting point is located 444 bp (409 bp) upstream of exon2 in a region previously described as an intron of the Cx32 gene in the rat (and mouse) genome, respectively. The alternative exon1B comprises 99 bp in rat, but 97 bp in the mouse genome, and is spliced to the same exon2 acceptor site also used for splicing of exon1 in liver. Both transcripts are likely to code for the same Cx32 protein whose reading frame is located in exon2. The putative promoter region, upstream of the alternative exon1B, contains a TATAAA motif and has been sequenced and noticed before by Miller et al.(Biosci. Rep. 8, 455-464,(1988)). The alternative exon1B transcript is highly expressed in the sciatic nerve,(ie Schwann cells) and very low in liver (ie hepatocytes). Its expression is regulated after sciatic nerve injury. The time course of expression was similar to previously established myelin genes and, therefore, we suggest that the expression of the alternative exon1B Cx32 transcript is related to the process of myelination. Very recently, we have characterized another alternative Cx32 exon1A which is \u2026",

            "We have previously shown that Mst87F (previously called mst(3)g1\u20139), a gene which is exclusively expressed in the male germ line of Drosophila melanogaster, is subject to negative translational control. While transcription of this gene takes place premeiotically, translation occurs only after the elongation of spermatids is complete. We report here the identification of a sequence element within the first 45 nucleotides of the leader which is crucial for this translational regulation. Sequence comparison with six other genes, which form a gene family with Mst87F, shows the conservation of a twelve nucleotide element within this leader segment. It is found in all genes at positions +28 to +39 of the leader. Deletion of this element or alteration of two nucleotides by in vitro mutagenesis both lead to the breakdown of the translational control mechanism. The poly(A) tail of the Mst87F mRNA becomes longer and \u2026",

            "Focal cortical lesions are associated with a functional downregulation of the GABAergic system in perilesional tissue lasting (at least) several weeks. The molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Here we used RT-PCR to investigate whether mRNA-levels of two \u03b1-subunits of the GABAA-receptor (\u03b11- and \u03b12-subunits) change following ischemic cortical lesioning. The results show that 7 days after lesion induction mRNA-levels for both the \u03b11- and \u03b12-subunits are increased threefold in perilesional tissue ipsilateral, but not contralateral to the lesion. Taken together with the results of a previous immunohistochemical study in which a moderate decrease of the \u03b11-subunit-protein and no change for the \u03b12-subunit [T. Neumann-Haefelin, J.F.
