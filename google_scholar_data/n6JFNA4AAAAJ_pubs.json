            "Recent work by Zamolodchikov and others has uncovered a solvable irrelevant deformation of general 2D CFTs, defined by turning on the dimension 4 operator, the product of the left-and right-moving stress tensor. We propose that in the holographic dual, this deformation represents a geometric cutoff that removes the asymptotic region of AdS and places the QFT on a Dirichlet wall at finite radial distance r= r c in the bulk. As a quantitative check of the proposed duality, we compute the signal propagation speed, energy spectrum, and thermodynamic relations on both sides. In all cases, we obtain a precise match. We derive an exact RG flow equation for the metric dependence of the effective action of the deformed theory, and find that it coincides with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation that governs the radial evolution of the classical gravity action in AdS.",
