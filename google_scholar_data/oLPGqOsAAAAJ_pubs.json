            "We present results from a lattice hadron spectrum calculation using three flavors of dynamical quarks\u2014two light and one strange\u2014and quenched simulations for comparison. These simulations were done using a one-loop Symanzik improved gauge action and an improved Kogut-Susskind quark action. The lattice spacings, and hence also the physical volumes, were tuned to be the same in all the runs to better expose differences due to flavor number. Lattice spacings were tuned using the static quark potential, so as a by-product we obtain updated results for the effect of sea quarks on the static quark potential. We find indications that the full QCD meson spectrum is in better agreement with experiment than the quenched spectrum. For the 0++(a 0) meson we see a coupling to two pseudoscalar mesons, or a meson decay on the lattice.",

            "We calculate the light hadron spectrum in full QCD using two plus one flavor asqtad sea quarks and domain wall valence quarks. Meson and baryon masses are calculated on a lattice of spatial size L\u2248 2.5 fm, and a lattice spacing of a\u2248 0.124 fm, for pion masses as light as m \u03c0\u2248 300 MeV, and compared with the results by the MILC Collaboration with asqtad valence quarks at the same lattice spacing. Two-and three-flavor chiral extrapolations of the baryon masses are performed using both continuum and mixed action heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. Both the three-flavor and two-flavor functional forms describe our lattice results, although the low-energy constants from the next-to-leading order S U (3) fits are inconsistent with their phenomenological values. Next-to-next-to-leading order S U (2) continuum formulae provide a good fit to the data and yield an extrapolated nucleon mass consistent with \u2026",
