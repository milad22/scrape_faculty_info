The interaction of the trapped field and the critical current causes an outward pressure, proportional to Bt2, which can crack the magnet. We have done an experiment to observe such cracking in a mini-magnet fabricated from four MT-YBCO discs activated at 49 K using an applied of 14 T. We have compared the results to existing theories which describe magnetic pressure in a trapped-field magnet (TFM) previously activated. We find that a modification is needed to describe magnetic pressure during the process of activation. We present the experimental results and the expanded theory, based on the simple Bean model. Theory and experiment show good agreement. We find that cracking is more likely during activation, and conclude that 10 T is achievable in TFM's composed of present \u2026",

The results are combined with our previous measurements of g1d. A perturbative QCD evolution in next-to-leading order is used to compute g1d(x) at a constant Q2. At Q2 = 10 GeV2, we obtain a first moment \u03931d=\u222b1dg1ddx=0.041\u00b10.008, a flavour-singlet axial charge of the nucleon a0 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.08, and an axial charge of the strange quark as = \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.03.

The pion production at lower energies is characterized by a fast falloff with increasing| t| at small| t| values, with a dip at t=\u2212 0.5 (G e V\/c) 2 followed by a secondary maximum around t=\u2212 0.9 (G e V\/c) 2 and a smooth falloff at larger| t| values.
