The aim of this study was to further characterize PCFL in a large series from North America.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data and archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were obtained from 32 patients. PCFL was defined as follicular lymphoma limited to the skin at the time of diagnosis and within the first 6 months after diagnosis. Specimens were analyzed for the expression of CD3, CD10, CD20, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 proteins by immunohistochemistry as well as for the presence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) by polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1, with a median age of 60 years. Twenty-four patients had lesions on the head and neck, five had lesions on the trunk, and three had lesions on both head and \u2026",

We describe the case of a 70-year-old man with malignant eccrine spiradenoma of the forearm and metastases to the axillary lymph nodes. Surgical excision with adequate margins and lymph node dissection was performed. Tamoxifen therapy was instituted after obtaining positive immunostaining results for estrogen receptor. After 41 months of follow-up, there has been no recurrence or distant metastases. Wide local excision and close follow-up are crucial in the management of malignant eccrine spiradenoma.

Most patients with polycythemia vera have JAK2V617F mutation. Analysis of an archival bone marrow aspirate sample from 1 patient showed a heterozygous mutation status. The blood and bone marrow samples from the other patient showed the presence of homozygous JAK2V617F mutation and BCR\/ABL1 fusion.

Our objectives were to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in critically ill AML patients. This was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AML admitted to ICU at the University of Alberta Hospital between January 1st 2002 and June 30th 2008. Each case was matched by age, sex, and illness severity (ICU only) to two control groups: hospitalized AML controls, and non-AML ICU controls. Data were extracted on demographics, course of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes. In total, 45 AML patients with available data were admitted to ICU. Mean (SD) age was 54.8 (13.1) years and 28.9% were female. Primary diagnoses were sepsis (32.6%) and respiratory failure (37.3%). Mean (SD) APACHE II score was 30.3 (10.3), SOFA score 12.6 (4.0) with 62.2% receiving mechanical ventilation, 55.6% vasoactive therapy, and 26.7% renal replacement therapy. Crude in-hospital, 90-day and 1-year mortality was 44.4%, 51.1% and 71.1%, respectively. AML cases had significantly higher adjusted-hazards of death (HR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.38-3.60, p = 0.001) compared to both non-AML ICU controls (HR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.11-2.58, p = 0.02) and hospitalized AML controls (OR 1.0, reference variable). Factors associated with ICU mortality by univariate analysis included older age, AML subtype, higher baseline SOFA score, no change or an increase in early SOFA score, shock, vasoactive therapy and mechanical ventilation.

            "In this case, we report an elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays who had recurrent Candida auris (C. auris) in blood despite antifungal therapy. C. auris was misidentified using conventional automated identification system as Candida haemulonii resulting in delayed diagnosis. The isolate showed increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to different antifungal drugs and persisted in the patient\u2019s blood before the patient deceased. This is the first case of C. auris reported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE); laboratories should be aware of this Candida species and should confirm suspected cases since it is an emerging multi-drug resistant and health-care associated Candida.",
