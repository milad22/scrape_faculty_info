In this paper, we develop a general purpose molecular dynamics code that runs entirely on a single GPU. It is shown that our GPU implementation provides a performance equivalent to that of fast 30 processor core distributed memory cluster. Our results show that GPUs already provide an inexpensive alternative to such clusters and discuss implications for the future.",

The crystals, formed by beads self-assembled on water droplets in oil, serve as model systems for exploring very general theories about the minimum-energy configurations of particles with arbitrary repulsive interactions on curved surfaces. Above a critical system size we find that crystals develop distinctive high-angle grain boundaries, or scars, not found in planar crystals. The number of excess defects in a scar is shown to grow linearly with the dimensionless system size. The observed slope is expected to be universal, independent of the microscopic potential.",

At finite temperature the physics of interacting disclinations is mapped to a Laplacian sine-Gordon Hamiltonian suitable for numerical simulations. We discuss general features of the ground state and thereafter specialize to the spherical case. The ground state is analyzed as a function of the ratio of the defect core energy to the Young\u2019s modulus. We argue that the core energy contribution becomes less and less important in the limit R\u226b a, where R is the radius of the sphere and a is the particle spacing. For large core energies there are 12 disclinations forming an icosahedron. For intermediate core energies unusual finite-length grain boundaries are preferred.

In most cases, the biological functionality of PA is associated with the presence of micromolar to millimolar calcium concentrations. It has been argued that PA can create defects in the packing of lipids in membranes due to lateral phase separation by divalent ions, which in turn aggregate proteins with high affinity for PA. In this article, we present a detailed investigation of the properties of PA domains in the presence of divalent ions by a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical methods.

            "The original Thomson problem of \u201cspherical crystallography\u201d seeks the ground state of electron shells interacting via the Coulomb potential; however one can also study crystalline ground states of particles interacting with other potentials. We focus here on long-range power-law interactions of the form 1\u2215 r \u03b3 (0< \u03b3< 2), with the classic Thomson problem given by \u03b3= 1. At large R\u2215 a, where R is the sphere radius and a is the particle spacing, the problem can be reformulated as a continuum elastic model that depends on the Young\u2019s modulus of particles packed in the plane and the universal (independent of the pair potential) geometrical interactions between disclination defects. The energy of the continuum model can be expressed as an expansion in powers of the total number of particles, M\u223c(R\u2215 a) 2, with coefficients explicitly related to both geometric and potential-dependent terms.
