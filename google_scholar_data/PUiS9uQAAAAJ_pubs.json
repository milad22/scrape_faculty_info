Mod. Phys. 58, 689 (1986)]. Developments in particle physics and inflationary theory, however, increasingly indicate that \u039b ought to be treated as a dynamical quantity. We reexamine the evolution of the scale factor with a variable \u039b term, and also generalize the treatment to include nonzero pressure. New solutions are obtained and evaluated using a variety of observational criteria. Existing arguments for the inevitability of a big bang (ie, an initial state with a= 0) are substantially weakened, and can be evaded in some cases with \u039b 0 (the present value of \u039b) well below current experimental limits.",

Both these new and apparently independent forms of matter\u2013energy have properties that are inconsistent with anything in the existing standard model of particle physics, and it appears that the latter must be extended. We review what is known about dark matter and energy from their impact on the light of the night sky. Most of the candidates that have been proposed so far are not perfectly black, but decay into or otherwise interact with photons in characteristic ways that can be accurately modelled and compared with observational data. We show how experimental limits on the intensity of cosmic background radiation in the microwave, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and \u03b3-ray bands put strong limits on decaying vacuum energy, light axions, neutrinos, unstable \u2026",

In both cases, observational data are compatible with nonsingular as well as big bang models. Requiring that the\" big bounce\" be deep enough to generate phenomena such as the cosmic microwave background and primordial light-element abundances, one can predict the present value of \u03a9 \u039b if the matter density \u03a9 0 is known.

Here we inquire what experimental constraints can be set on \u0394 for various solar system objects when this assumption is relaxed. Extending an analysis originally due to Nordtvedt, we obtain upper limits on linearly independent combinations of \u0394 for two or more bodies from Kepler\u2019s third law, the position of Lagrange libration points, and the phenomenon of orbital polarization. Combining our results, we extract numerical upper bounds on \u0394 for the Sun, Moon, Earth and Jupiter, using observational data on their orbits as well as those of the Trojan asteroids. These are applied as a test case to the theory of higher-dimensional (Kaluza-Klein) gravity. The results are three to six orders of \u2026",
