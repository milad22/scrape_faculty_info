            "We present results of a study of neutrino oscillation based on a 766 ton\/year exposure of KamLAND to reactor antineutrinos. We observe 258 \u03bd e candidate events with energies above 3.4 MeV compared to 365.2\u00b123.7 events expected in the absence of neutrino oscillation. Accounting for 17.8\u00b17.3 expected background events, the statistical significance for reactor \u03bd e disappearance is 99.998%. The observed energy spectrum disagrees with the expected spectral shape in the absence of neutrino oscillation at 99.6% significance and prefers the distortion expected from \u03bd e oscillation effects. A two-neutrino oscillation analysis of the KamLAND data gives \u0394 m 2= 7.9\u2212 0.5+ 0.6\u00d7 10\u2212 5 e V 2.

It is the only detector that concentrates its efforts on limited goals of measuring electrons, muons and photons. By not attempting to identify hadrons, L3 has been able to provide an order of magnitude better resolution for electrons, muons and photons. Vertices and hadron jets are also studied. The construction of L3 has involved much state of the art technology in new principles of vertex detection and in new crystals for large scale electromagnetic shower detection and ultraprecise muon detection.
