In relativistic quantum field theory, a broken continuous symmetry leads to the emergence of two types of fundamental excitation: massless Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes and a massive \u2018Higgs\u2019 amplitude mode. An excitation of Higgs type is of crucial importance in the standard model of elementary particle physics 1, and also appears as a fundamental collective mode in quantum many-body systems 2. Whether such a mode exists in low-dimensional systems as a resonance-like feature, or whether it becomes overdamped through coupling to Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes, has been a subject of debate 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

One example of such a transition is the recently proposed many-body localization-delocalization transition, in which transport coefficients vanish at a critical temperature with no singularities in thermodynamic observables. Describing this purely dynamical quantum criticality is technically challenging as understanding the finite-temperature dynamics necessarily requires averaging over a large number of matrix elements between many-body eigenstates. Here, we develop a real-space renormalization group method for excited states that allows us to overcome this challenge in a large class of models.

Starting from a repulsive Fermi-Hubbard system near half filling, we generate additional doubly occupied sites (doublons) by lattice modulation. The subsequent relaxation back to thermal equilibrium is monitored over time. The measured absolute doublon lifetime covers 2 orders of magnitude. In units of the tunneling time h\/J it is found to depend exponentially on the ratio of on-site interaction energy U to kinetic energy J. We argue that the dominant mechanism for the relaxation is a simultaneous many-body process involving several single fermions as scattering partners.
