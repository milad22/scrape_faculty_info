            "The amygdaloid nuclear complex is critical for producing appropriate emotional and behavioral responses to biologically relevant sensory stimuli. It constitutes an essential link between sensory and limbic areas of the cerebral cortex and subcortical brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, brainstem, and striatum, that are responsible for eliciting emotional and motivational responses.This review summarizes the anatomy and physiology of the cortical pathways to the amygdala in the rat, cat and monkey. Although the basic anatomy of these systems in the cat and monkey was largely delineated in studies conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, detailed information regarding the cortico-amygdalar pathways in the rat was only obtained in the past several years. The purpose of this review is to describe the results of recent studies in the rat and to compare the organization of cortico-amygdalar projections in this \u2026",

Although the caudatoputamen and nucleus accumbens are the principal components of the striatum, there is evidence that lateral portions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central amygdaloid nucleus may be striatal-like structures. The basolateral nucleus was the main source of amygdaloid fibers to all of these structures. In many instances labeled areas of the basolateral nucleus were continuous with labeled areas in the adjacent lateral and basomedial nuclei. Amygdaloid neurons projecting to the striatum and striatal-like areas exhibited an overlapping topographical organization.In \u2026",

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the rat CN using Nissl, Kluver-Barrera, and Golgi techniques suggests that it consists of four subdivisions. The medial subdivision (CM), which is closely associated with the stria terminalis, is narrow caudally but enlarges near the rostral pole of CN. Most neurons in CM have long dendrites that branch sparingly and have a moderate number of dendritic spines. A smaller number of CM neurons have thick dendrites with virtually no spines.

            " The projections of the cerebral cortex to the extended amygdala were studied in the rat using anterograde and retrograde tract\u2010tracing techniques. Most cortical areas with strong projections to the extended amygdala preferentially targeted either the medial extended amygdala (including the medial amygdalar nucleus, ventromedial substantia innominata, and the medial part of the bed nucleus the stria terminalis) or the central extended amygdala (including the central amygdalar nucleus, dorsolateral substantia innominata, and the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). Some cortical areas, however, had equal projections to both medial and central portions. The main areas projecting preferentially to the medial extended amygdala were the ventral subiculum, infralimbic cortex, ventral agranular insular area, and the rostral part of the ventrolateral entorhinal area. The main areas projecting \u2026",
