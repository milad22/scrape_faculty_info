            "A systematic study is made of the non-perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics. The basic object is the two-point functions of various currents. At large Euclidean momenta q the non-perturbative contributions induce a series in (\u03bc2\/q2) where \u03bc is some typical hadronic mass. The terms of this series are shown to be of two distinct types. The first few of them are connected with vacuum fluctuations of large size, and can be consistently accounted for within the Wilson operator expansion. On the other hand, in high orders small-size fluctuations show up and the high-order terms do not reduce (generally speaking) to the vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements of local operators. This signals the breakdown of the operator expansion. The corresponding critical dimension is found. We propose a Borel improvement of the power series. On one hand, it makes the two-point functions less sensitive to high-order terms, and \u2026",

            "Resonance properties are investigated within the QCD-based approach to resonance physics developed earlier. We extend first the dispersion charmonium theory to include power terms due to the non-perturbative effects of QCD. As a byproduct, an estimate for the gluonic vacuum expectation value, <0|G\u03bc\u03bdaG\u03bc\u03bda|0>, emerges. The main emphasis is made on the analysis of the \u03f1, \u03c9, \u03d5, K\u2217 mesons. Predictions are formulated for integrals of the type \u222b Im \u03a0 e\u2212s\/M2 ds where Im \u03a0 is aan appropriate spectral density. It is shown that there exist such M2 that the integrals are dominated by a single resonance, on one hand, and are calculable in a reliable way, on the other. As a result we are able to calculate the resonance coupling constants and masses. The typical accuracy achieved is about 10%. The power terms considered explain both the \u03c0-\u03f1-A1 mass splittings and the observed pattern of the SU(3) symmetry \u2026",

In this review theoretical interpretation of charmonium properties is given. The classification of charmonium levels and their electromagnetic and strong decays are discussed. The basic assumption is that strong interaction between charmed quark and charmed antiquark in charmonium is mediated by coloured gluons as described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It is argued that charmonium is an ideal object to test the basic ideas of QCD. Both the traditional nonrelativistic approach to charmonium and the dispersion one are presented. The latter approach is free from many additional assumptions inherent to potential calculations. Other applications of QCD to the charmed world are briefly reviewed.

The weak interactions are described within the Weinberg-Salam model while the strong interactions are assumed to be mediated by the exchange of an octet of colour vector gluons. It is shown that the effect of the strong interactions gives rise to new operators in the effective Hamiltonian of weak interactions which contain both left-and right-handed fermions.

Starting from our classification we establish the hierarchy of scales. Regularities of the hadronic phenomenology [Zweig's selection rule, approximate SU(6) symmetry and so on] are naturally explained. The properties of glueballs are discussed in some detail.
