The purpose of this study was to develop and validate case definitions and case-finding algorithms used to identify 8 common chronic conditions in primary care: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, depression, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, parkinsonism, and epilepsy.Using a cross-sectional data validation study design, regional and local CPCSSN networks from British Columbia, Alberta (2), Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland participated in validating EHR case-finding algorithms. A random sample of EHR charts were reviewed, oversampling for patients older than 60 years and for those with epilepsy or parkinsonism. Charts were reviewed by trained research assistants and \u2026",

            "Background. A common tenet in emergency medical services (EMS) is that faster response equates to better patient outcome, translated by some EMS operations into a goal of a response time of 8 minutes or less for advanced life support (ALS) units responding to life-threatening events. Objective. To explore whether an 8-minute EMS response time was associated with mortality. Methods. This was a one-year retrospective cohort study of adults with a life-threatening event as assessed at the time of the 9-1-1 call (Medical Priority Dispatch System Echo-or Delta-level event). The study setting was an urban all-ALS EMS system serving a population of approximately 1 million. Response time was defined as 9-1-1 call receipt to ALS unit arrival on scene, and outcome was defined as all-cause mortality at hospital discharge. Potential covariates included patient acuity, age, gender, and combined scene and transport \u2026",

            "Registry-based randomized controlled trials are defined as pragmatic trials that use registries as a platform for case records, data collection, randomization, and follow-up. Recently, the application of registry-based randomized controlled trials has attracted increasing attention in health research to address comparative effectiveness research questions in real-world settings, mainly due to their low cost, enhanced generalizability of findings, rapid consecutive enrollment, and the potential completeness of follow-up for the reference population, when compared with conventional randomized effectiveness trials. However several challenges of registry-based randomized controlled trials have to be taken into consideration, including registry data quality, ethical issues, and methodological challenges.

Time C (door-toarterial access time) is assumed to be 90 minutes in the mothership scenario, and 50 minutes in the drip and ship scenario as treatment times has been shown to be faster at the ECC because of prenotification in the drip and ship case. 13 We assume that first reperfusion is achieved 30 minutes into the endovascular procedure. For alteplase, the time of reperfusion is harder to define. We define early reperfusion as 70 minutes post treatment initiation because angiography studies have shown that 1.6% of internal carotid artery, 23.9% of M1 (M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery), and 38.9% of M2 (M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery) occlusions were recanalized at first angiography post alteplase administration (median 70 minutes). 14 Also, this is a relevant time point when considering interfacility transportation.
