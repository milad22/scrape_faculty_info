            "Topological insulators are a new class of insulators in which a bulk gap for electronic excitations is generated because of the strong spin\u2013orbit coupling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 inherent to these systems. These materials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless metallic surface states, resembling chiral edge modes in quantum Hall systems, but with unconventional spin textures. A key predicted feature of such spin-textured boundary states is their insensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which is thought to protect them from backscattering and localization. Recently, experimental and theoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for the existence of both two-and three-dimensional classes of such topological insulator materials in semiconductor quantum well structures 6, 7, 8 and several bismuth-based compounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, but so far experiments have not probed the sensitivity of these \u2026",

            "Doped Mott insulators have a strong propensity to form patterns of holes and spins often referred to as stripes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In copper oxides, doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state 6, which can be transformed into a high-temperature superconducting state with sufficient doping or by reducing the temperature. A long-standing issue has been the interplay between the pseudogap, which is generic to all hole-doped copper oxide superconductors, and stripes, whose static form occurs in only one family of copper oxides over a narrow range of the phase diagram 2, 7. Here we report observations of the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset of the pseudogap state in the high-temperature superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x, using spectroscopic mapping with a scanning tunnelling microscope. We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with the appearance of electronic patterns \u2026",

            "One of the intriguing properties of quantum many-body systems is the emergence of long-range order from particles with short-range interactions. For example, magnetism involves the long-range ordering of electron spins. Systems of ultracold atoms are rapidly emerging as precise and controllable simulators of magnetism and other phenomena. Spinor condensates 1, 2 are a powerful tool in this regard; however, the spin interaction is typically weak and accessible only when multiple atomic internal states are collisionally stable. Here we demonstrate a lattice-shaking technique for hybridizing Bloch bands in optical lattices to introduce a strong effective spin interaction and the formation of large ferromagnetic domains. Our band hybridization method is independent of the atomic internal state, and can be widely applied to quantum simulators to explore new magnetic phases in optical lattices with tunable band \u2026",

We use atomic scale imaging and spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope to examine the novel electronic states that emerge from the uranium f states in URu2Si2. We find that, as the temperature is lowered, partial screening of the f electrons\u2019 spins gives rise to a spatially modulated Kondo\u2013Fano resonance that is maximal between the surface U atoms. At T = 17.5 K, URu2Si2 is known to undergo a second-order phase transition from the Kondo lattice state into a phase with a hidden order parameter. From tunneling spectroscopy, we identify a spatially modulated, bias-asymmetric energy gap with a mean-field temperature dependence that develops in the hidden order state. Spectroscopic imaging further reveals a spatial correlation between the hidden order gap and the Kondo resonance \u2026",
