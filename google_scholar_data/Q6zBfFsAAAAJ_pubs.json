The upper critical field for magnetic fields perpendicular and parallel to the basal planes is presented in the entire temperature range. A very different temperature dependence has been observed in the two directions, which yields a temperature-dependent anisotropy with \u0393\u223c 5 at low temperatures and\u223c 2 near T c. A peak effect is observed for \u03bc 0 H\u223c 2 T parallel to the c axis, and the critical current density presents a sharp maximum for H parallel to the ab plane.",

            "We have investigated the pressure dependence (up to 20 kbar) of the metal-insulator (MI) transition displayed by the orthorhombic perovskites R NiO 3 (R= Nd, Pr, and Nd 0.7 La 0.3) by means of electrical resistance measurements. The transition temperature decreases under pressure, with a common rate of decrease of dT MI\/dP=-4.2 K\/kbar, in spite of differences in T MI (100\u2013200 K). On the basis of the structural effects associated with the application of pressure in these orthorhombic perovskites, we conclude that the metallic phase is stabilized by pressure because the bandwidth increases and hence the charge-transfer gap is reduced. This decrease with pressure of the charge-transfer gap in the R NiO 3 perovskites is in contrast to the dependence predicted and observed in the layered cuprates where the charge-transfer energy dominates the bandwidth effects. In addition, our experiments show that the first \u2026",
