Stat1 homodimers also transduce signals for IFN-\u03b3. To explore the unique properties of Stat2 and ISGF-3 in type I IFN signaling, its gene was targeted for deletion. Stat2 null mice exhibit a number of defects in immune response. This includes an increased susceptibility to viral infection and the loss of a type I IFN autocrine\/paracrine loop, which in turn regulates several aspects of immune response. Intriguingly, Stat2-deficient fibroblasts exhibit a more significant defect in their response to type I IFNs than macrophages, highlighting tissue-specific differences in the response to this family of ligands.",

The new designed R245fa expander works stably in the experiment, with an average expansion power output of 1.73 kW and an average isentropic efficiency of 45.2%. The overall power generation efficiency estimated is 4.2%, when the evacuated solar collector is utilized in the system, and with the condition of flat plate solar collector, it is about 3.2%.

Three typical mass fractions 0.9\/0.1 (Ma) 0.65\/0.35 (Mb), 0.45\/0.55 (Mc) of R245fa\/R152a are chosen. In the proposed temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 85 \u00b0C, the three zeotropic mixtures are investigated as the working fluids of the low-temperature solar Rankine cycle. Because there is an obvious temperature glide during phase change for zeotropic mixtures, an internal heat exchanger (IHE) is introduced to the Rankine cycle. Investigation shows that different from the pure fluids, among the proposed zeotropic mixtures, the isentropic working fluid Mb possesses the lowest Rankine cycle efficiency. For zeotropic mixtures a significant increase of thermal efficiencies can be gained when superheating is combined with IHE.

The two genes act antagonistically to restrict each other to their proper domains of action within the floral meristem. In addition to AG, which antagonizes AP2, miR172, a microRNA, serves as a negative regulator of AP2. In this study, we showed that AG and miR172 have distinct functions in flower development and that they largely act independently in the negative regulation of AP2. We uncovered functions of miR172\u2010mediated repression of AP2 in the regulation of floral stem cells and in the delineation of the expression domain of another class of floral homeotic genes.
