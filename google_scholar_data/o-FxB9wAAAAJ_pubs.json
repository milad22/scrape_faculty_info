            "Molecular dynamics modeling has provided a powerful tool for simulating and understanding diverse systems \u2013 ranging from materials processes to biophysical phenomena. Parallel formulations of these methods have been shown to be among the most scalable scientific computing applications. Many instances of this class of methods rely on a static bond structure for molecules, rendering them infeasible for reactive systems. Recent work on reactive force fields has resulted in the development of ReaxFF, a novel bond order potential that bridges quantum-scale and classical MD approaches by explicitly modeling bond activity (reactions) and charge equilibration. These aspects of ReaxFF pose significant challenges from a computational standpoint, both in sequential and parallel contexts. Evolving bond structure requires efficient dynamic data structures.

This first-of-its-kind simulation achieves length and time scales required to investigate the detailed chemistry of the system. Our molecular dynamics approach is based on the ReaxFF force field of van Duin et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 107, 3803 (2003)]. The specific ReaxFF implementation (SERIALREAX) and force fields are first validated on structural properties of pure silica and water systems. Chemical reactions between reactive water and dangling bonds on a freshly cut silica surface are analyzed by studying changing chemical composition at the interface. In our simulations, reactions involving silanol groups reach chemical equilibrium in \u223c250\u2002ps. It is observed that water molecules penetrate a silica film through a proton-transfer process we call \u201chydrogen hopping,\u201d which is similar to the Grotthuss mechanism.

Due to the rugged nature of the membrane\/electrolyte interface, ion binding to the membrane surface is characterized by the loss of ion hydration. Using this structural characterization, binding of Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions to the membrane is observed, although the binding of Cl\u2212 is seen to be slightly weaker than that of Na+. Dehydration is seen to occur to a different extent for each type of ion. In addition, the excess binding of Na+ gives rise to a net positive surface charge density just outside the bilayer. The positive density produces a positive electrostatic potential in this region, whereas the system without salt shows an electrostatic potential of zero.",

Construction of the force fields is by standard methods of electronic structure computations for bond parameters and charge distribution and specific volumes and heats of vaporization for small-molecule components of the larger lipid molecules for van der Waals parameters. Some parameters from the earlier 43A1 force field are found to be correct in the context of these calculations, while others are modified. The validity of the force fields is demonstrated by correct replication of X-ray form factors and NMR order parameters over a wide range of membrane compositions in semi-isotropic NTP 1 atm simulations. 43-A1-S3 compares favorably with other force fields used in conjunction with the Gromacs simulation package with respect to the breadth of phenomena that it accurately reproduces.",

These domains are similar to \u201crafts\u201d isolated from cell membranes, although the latter are much smaller in lateral size. Such domain formation can be a result of very specific and subtle lipid-lipid interactions. To identify and study these interactions, we have performed two molecular dynamics simulations, of 200-ns duration, of dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol (Chol) systems, a 1:1:1 mixture of DOPC\/SM\/Chol, and a 1:1 mixture of DOPC\/SM. The simulations show initial stages of the onset of spontaneous phase-separated domains in the systems.

            "It is postulated that the specific interactions between cholesterol and lipids in biological membranes are crucial in the formation of complexes leading subsequently to membrane domains (so-called rafts). These interactions are studied in molecular dynamics simulations performed on a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)-cholesterol bilayer mixture and a dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC)-cholesterol bilayer mixture, both having a cholesterol concentration of 40 mol %. Complexation of the simulated phospholipids with cholesterol is observed and visualized, exhibiting 2:1 and 1:1 stoichiometries. The most popular complex is found to be 1:1 in the case of DLPC, whereas the DPPC system carries a larger population of 2:1 complexes. This difference in the observed populations of complexes is shown to be a result of differences in packing geometry and phospholipid conformation due to the differing tail length \u2026",
