            "Synthesis of nanocrystals with exposed high-energy facets is a well-known challenge in many fields of science and technology. The higher reactivity of these facets simultaneously makes them desirable catalysts for sluggish chemical reactions and leads to their small populations in an equilibrated crystal. Using anatase TiO2 as an example, we demonstrate a facile approach for creating high-surface-area stable nanosheets comprising nearly 100% exposed (001) facets. Our approach relies on spontaneous assembly of the nanosheets into three-dimensional hierarchical spheres, which stabilizes them from collapse. We show that the high surface density of exposed TiO2 (001) facets leads to fast lithium insertion\/deinsertion processes in batteries that mimic features seen in high-power electrochemical capacitors.",

The thickness of the GCP coating can be facilely manipulated by varying glucose concentration in the synthesis medium. Carbon-coated SnO2 nanocolloids obtained after carbonization of the GCP coating exhibit significantly enhanced cycling performance for lithium storage.
