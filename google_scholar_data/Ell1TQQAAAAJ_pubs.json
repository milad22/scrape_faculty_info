A naive renormalization group analysis, neglecting weak scale threshold corrections, leads to moderate agreement with the low energy data. However, it is known that intrinsically large threshold corrections proportional to tan \u03b2\u223c m t (M Z)\/m b (M Z)\u223c 50 can nullify these t, b, \u03c4 mass predictions. In this paper we turn the argument around. Instead of predicting fermion masses, we use the constraint of Yukawa unification and the observed values M t, m b (m b), M \u03c4 to constrain SUSY parameter space. We find a narrow region survives for \u03bc> 0 with \u03bc, M 1\/2\u226a m 16, A 0\u2248\u2212 1.9 m 16 and m 16> 1200 GeV. Demanding Yukawa unification thus makes definite predictions for Higgs boson and sparticle masses. In particular, we find a light Higgs boson with a mass m h 0= 114\u00b15\u00b13 GeV and a light top squark with (m t 1) MIN\u223c 450 \u2026",

Typically these non\u2013standard model particles form part of a \u201chidden\u201d sector, for example a pair of neutral Higgs bosons or a pair of unstable neutralinos. We emphasize that such decays allow for a Higgs substantially below the standard model Higgs Large Electron-Positron Collider limit of 114 GeV. A Higgs with standard model WW, ZZ, and top couplings and a mass near 100 GeV eliminates the fine-tuning problems of many beyond the standard model theories, in particular supersymmetric models, and leads to excellent consistency with precision electroweak data.",

            "We present an extended study of how the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Model easily avoids fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking for a SM-like light Higgs with mass in the vicinity of 100 GeV, as beautifully consistent with precision electroweak data, while escaping LEP constraints due to the dominance of h\u2192 aa decays with ma< 2mb so that a\u2192 \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212 or jets. The residual\u223c 10% branching ratio for h\u2192 bb explains perfectly the well-known LEP excess at mh\u223c 100 GeV. Details of model parameter correlations and requirements are discussed as a function tan \u03b2. Comparisons of fine-tuning in the NMSSM to that in the MSSM are presented. We also discuss fine-tuning associated with scenarios in which the a is essentially pure singlet, has mass ma> 30 GeV, and decays primarily to \u03b3\u03b3 leading to an h\u2192 aa\u2192 4\u03b3 Higgs signal.",
