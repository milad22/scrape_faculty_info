We first review the representation of these contributions by three parameters S, T, and U and discuss the assumptions involved in this reduction. We then discuss the contributions to these parameters from various models of new physics. We show that S can be computed by a dispersion relation, and we use this technique to estimate S in technicolor models of the Higgs sector. We discuss the reliability and the gauge invariance of this estimate. Finally, we present the limits on S and T imposed by current experimental results.",

We derive the low-energy effective Lagrangian which turns out to involve two parameters: one measuring the nonminimal coupling of fermions in the presence of torsion, the other being the Immirzi parameter. In the case of nonminimal coupling the effective Lagrangian contains an axial-vector interaction leading to parity violation. Alternatively, in the case of minimal coupling there is no parity violation and the effective Lagrangian contains only the usual axial-axial interaction. In this situation the real values of the Immirzi parameter are not at all constrained. On the other hand, purely imaginary values of the Immirzi parameter lead to violations of unitarity for the case of \u2026",

Here G \u03bc=(1.166 39\u00b10.000 0 2)\u00d7 10\u2212 5 GeV\/c 2 is the muon decay constant. For the present value of M W=(80.14\u00b10. 2 7) GeV\/c 2, and with m t= 140 GeV\/c 2, one expects \u0393 (W\u2192 e \u03bd)=(224.4\u00b12. 3) MeV. The total width \u0393 tot (W) is also expected to lack oblique corrections from new physics, so that \u0393 tot (W) \u0393 (W\u2192 e \u03bd)= 3+ 6 [1+{\u03b1 s (M W) \u03c0}].
