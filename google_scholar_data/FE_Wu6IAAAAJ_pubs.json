We assessed the effect of the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events when added to the existing antihyperglycaemic regimens of individuals with type 2 diabetes with and without previous cardiovascular disease and a wide range of glycaemic control.This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at 371 sites in 24 countries. Men and women aged at least 50 years with type 2 diabetes who had either a previous cardiovascular event or cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned (1:1) to either weekly subcutaneous injection of dulaglutide (1\u00b75 mg) or placebo.

            "Metal-oxide surge arresters have dynamic characteristics that are significant for overvoltage coordination studies involving fast front surges. Several models with acceptable accuracy have been proposed to simulate this frequency-dependent behavior. Difficulties arise in the calculation and adjustment of the model parameters: in some cases iterative procedures are required, in others the necessary data are not reported on manufacturers\u2019 datasheets. A simplified model for zinc oxide surge arresters has already been developed, on the basis of the frequencydependent model recommended by the IEEE WG. 3.4. 11. In this paper, a different, also straightforward approach, for the generation of the IEEE model parameters from published manufacturer\u2019s data, is presented. The model was verified for several medium voltage arresters from different manufacturers. The simulations were performed with the Alternative Transient Program (ATP) and the results were compared with both the data reported on the manufacturer\u2019s catalogue and experimental data acquired in the high voltage laboratory. For a fast front current surges with front times of up to 1 \u00b5s, the model has an acceptable voltage response accuracy of about 1.5%.",

            "Vanadium dioxide shows a passive and reversible change from a monoclinic insulator phase to a metallic tetragonal rutile structure when the sample temperature is close to and over 68 \u00b0C. As a kind of functional material, VO2 thin films deposited on fused quartz substrates were successfully prepared by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. With laser illumination at 400 nm on the obtained films, the phase transition (PT) occurred. The observed light-induced PT was as fast as the laser pulse duration of 100 fs. Using a femtosecond laser system, the relaxation processes in VO2 were studied by optical pump\u2013probe spectroscopy. Upon a laser excitation an instantaneous response in the transient reflectivity and transmission was observed followed by a relatively longer relaxation process. The alteration is dependent on pump power. The change in reflectance reached a maximum value at a pump pulse energy \u2026",
