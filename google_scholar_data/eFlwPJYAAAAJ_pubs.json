            "Fire is a worldwide phenomenon that appears in the geological record soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants. Fire influences global ecosystem patterns and processes, including vegetation distribution and structure, the carbon cycle, and climate. Although humans and fire have always coexisted, our capacity to manage fire remains imperfect and may become more difficult in the future as climate change alters fire regimes. This risk is difficult to assess, however, because fires are still poorly represented in global models. Here, we discuss some of the most important issues involved in developing a better understanding of the role of fire in the Earth system.",

In one dimension the ground state is completely dimerized near half filling. We show that this behavior agrees with a renormalization-group solution of the one-dimensional SU (n) Hubbard model. In two spatial dimensions we find several different ground states depending on the size of the hopping term t, the doping \u03b4, and the biquadratic spin interaction J \u0303. In particular, the undimerized\" flux\" or\" s+ i d\" phase is the ground state at half filling for sufficiently large t or J \u0303.

Two distinct states occur in the large\u2010n limit, depending on the size of the biquadratic interaction J\u0303. When J\u0303=0, there are an infinite number of degenerate ground states consisting of disconnected dimers. At finite n, however, this degeneracy is broken by local resonance.

For intermediate values of J\u0303, a phase transition from the dimer state to the chiral phase occurs as the temperature increases.

We then introduce a simplified model in two spatial dimensions to study the role that spin and perfect nesting play in destabilizing fermion liquids. The complicated functional renormalization-group equations of the full problem are made tractable in our model by replacing the continuum of points that make up the closed Fermi line with four Fermi points. Despite this drastic approximation, the model exhibits physically reasonable behavior both at half-filling (where instabilities occur) and away from half-filling (where a Luttinger liquid arises).

Using a mean-field solution of the t-J model, we calculate the size of circulating currents in the CuO 2 planes. For realistic parameters we find nonzero currents when the doping \u03b4< 0.12. Taking into account structural details, we calculate the physical magnetic-field strength and the neutron-scattering cross section. The static field at the muon site varies between 0 and 100 G depending mainly on doping but with additional complications being the size of the Wannier functions, temperature, screening, localization, and the mean-field-approximation itself. These fields are not detected in muon-spin-relaxation experiments but cannot be ruled out both because of the aforementioned complications and because at low doping the muon is also affected by residual quasistatic spin moments \u2026",

In addition to the familiar dimer phase, we find a confining phase with plaquette order and a topologically ordered phase with deconfined S= 1\/2 spinons and helical spin correlations. The deconfined phase is contiguous to the dimer phase and in a regime of couplings close to those found in the insulator SrCu 2 (BO 3) 2. We suggest that a superconductor obtained by doping this insulator with mobile charge carriers will be an attractive candidate for observing the anomalous magnetic flux properties associated with topological order.",

These two models may describe respectively the magnetic and electronic properties of the family of layered organic materials \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF) 2 X. The Heisenberg model is also relevant to the frustrated antiferromagnet, Cs 2 CuCl 4. We find rich phase diagrams for each model. The Sp (N) antiferromagnet is shown to have five different phases as a function of the size of the spin and the degree of anisotropy of the triangular lattice. The effects of fluctuations at finite N are also discussed. For parameters relevant to Cs 2 CuCl 4 the ground state either exhibits incommensurate spin order, or is in a quantum disordered phase with deconfined spin-1\/2 excitations and topological order. The SU (N) Hubbard-Heisenberg model exhibits an insulating dimer phase, an insulating box phase, a semi \u2026",
