An example is a cosmic scalar field evolving in a potential, but our treatment is more general. Including this component alters cosmic evolution in a way that fits current observations well. Unlike \u039b, it evolves dynamically and develops fluctuations, leaving a distinctive imprint on the microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum.",

            "It is extraordinary that a number of observations indicate that we live in a spatially flat, low matter density Universe, which is currently undergoing a period of accelerating expansion. The effort to explain this current state has focused attention on cosmological models in which the dominant component of the cosmic energy density has negative pressure, with an equation of state w\u2a7e\u22121. Remarking that most observations are consistent with models right up to the w=\u22121 or cosmological constant (\u039b) limit, it is natural to ask what lies on the other side, at w<\u22121. In this regard, we construct a toy model of a \u201cphantom\u201d energy component which possesses an equation of state w<\u22121. Such a component is found to be compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on current data, including the recent type 1a SNe data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum.

The discovery implies that our most basic notions about how gravity works are violated on cosmological distance scales. A simple fix is to introduce a cosmological constant into the field equations for general relativity. However, the extremely small value of the cosmological constant, relative to theoretical expectations, has led theorists to explore numerous alternative explanations that involve the introduction of an exotic negative-pressure fluid or a modification of general relativity. Here we review the evidence for cosmic acceleration. We then survey some of the theoretical attempts to account for it, including the cosmological constant, quintessence and its variants, mass-varying neutrinos, and modifications of general relativity.

            "We present simple analytic approximations for the linear and fully evolved nonlinear mass power spectrum of matter density fluctuations for spatially flat cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological models with quintessence (Q). Quintessence is a time\u2010evolving, spatially inhomogeneous energy component with negative pressure and an equation of state  . It clusters gravitationally on large length scales but remains smooth like the cosmological constant on small length scales. We show that the clustering scale is determined by the Compton wavelength of the Q\u2010field and derive a shape parameter,  , to characterize the linear mass power spectrum. The growth of linear perturbations as functions of redshift,  , and matter density,  , is also quantified. Calibrating to N\u2010body simulations, we construct a simple extension of Ma's 1998 formula that closely approximates the nonlinear power spectrum for a range of plausible QCDM \u2026",
