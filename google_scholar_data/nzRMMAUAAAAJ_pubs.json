Low molecular weight branched polyethylenimine (LMW-PEI) was synthesized and studied as a DNA carrier for gene delivery with regard to physico-chemical properties, cytotoxicity, and transfection efficiency. Methods. The architecture of LMW-PEI, synthesized by acid catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of aziridine was characterized by size exclusion chromatography in combination with laser light scattering and 13C-NMR-spectroscopy. In vitro cytotoxic effects were quantified by LDH and MTT assay and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The potential for transgene expression was monitored in ECV304 cells using luciferase driven by a SV40 promoter as reporter gene system. Results. LMW-PEI (Mw 11\u2032900 D) with a low degree of branching was synthesized as a DNA carrier for gene delivery. In contrast to high molecular weight polyethylenimines (HMW-PEI \u2026",

            "After optic nerve injury in mature mammals, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are normally unable to regenerate their axons and undergo delayed apoptosis. However, if the lens is damaged at the time of nerve injury, many RGCs survive axotomy and regenerate their axons into the distal optic nerve. Lens injury induces macrophage activation, and we show here that factors secreted by macrophages stimulate RGCs to regenerate their axons. When macrophages were activated by intravitreal injections of Zymosan, a yeast cell wall preparation, the number of RGC axons regenerating into the distal optic nerve was even greater than after lens injury. These effects were further enhanced if Zymosan was injected 3 d after nerve crush. In a grafting paradigm, intravitreal Zymosan increased the number of RGCs that regenerated their axons through a 1.5 cm peripheral nerve graft twofold relative to uninjected controls and \u2026",

The twofold pairing symmetry was further supported by the observation of striped electronic nanostructures in the slightly Se-doped samples.

The loss of lithium inventory, loss of active material, and the increase in resistance may result in battery aging. Generally, analysis of the battery aging mechanism requires dismantling of batteries and using methods such as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. These methods may permanently damage the battery. Therefore, the methods are inappropriate for the battery management system (BMS) in an electric vehicle. The constant current charging curves while charging the battery could be used to get the incremental capacity and differential voltage curves for identifying the aging mechanism; the battery state-of-health can then be estimated. This method can be potentially used in the BMS for online diagnostic and prognostic \u2026",
