            "Although the idea that entropy alone is sufficient to produce an ordered state is an old one in colloid science 1, the notion remains counter-intuitive and it is often assumed that attractive interactions are necessary to generate phases with long-range order. The phase behaviour for both rods and spheres has been studied experimentally 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, theoretically 8, 9 and by computer simulations 10. Here we describe the phase behaviour of mixtures of colloidal rod-like and sphere-like particles (respectively viruses and polystyrene latex or polyethylene oxide polymer) under conditions in which they act like hard'particles 2, 3. We find a wealth of behaviour: bulk demixing into rod-rich and rod-poor phases and microphase separation into a variety of morphologies. One microphase consists of layers of rods alternating with layers of spheres 11; in another microphase of unanticipated complexity, the spheres \u2026",

We find that the measured pair potential has an attractive component much greater than predicted by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory of nonconfined colloids and suggest that the confining plates are responsible for the observed deviations from theory.",

It will treat the simplest case where the rods are the sole colloidal component and also the more complex phase behavior that arises in mixtures of binary rods and mixtures of rods with spherical colloids, or with polymers. An enormous volume of literature is devoted to the theoretical treatment and computer simulation of the phase behavior of hard rod systems. Viruses, because of their monodispersity and well-characterized interparticle interactions, continue to be the best experimental system for exploring the issues raised by theory. These include elucidating the fundamental relationship between molecular properties, such as length and charge, and macroscopic properties, such as phase behavior. Furthermore, through genetic engineering of viruses, new colloids have been created that are \u2026",

The Phase Chip exploits the permeation of water through poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) in order to controllably vary the concentration of solutes in aqueous nanoliter volume microdrops stored in wells. The permeation of water in the Phase Chip is modeled using the diffusion equation, and good agreement between experiment and theory is obtained. The Phase Chip operates by first creating drops of the water\/solute mixture whose composition varies sequentially. Next, drops are transported down channels and guided into storage wells using surface tension forces. Finally, the solute concentration of each stored drop is simultaneously varied and measured. Two applications of the Phase Chip are presented. First, the phase diagram of a polymer\/salt mixture is \u2026",

            "The specific magnetic-field-induced birefringence is measured in isotropic suspensions of the rodlike particle tobacco mosaic virus as a function of concentration and added salt. This quantity is proportional to the angular correlations between particles at zero field. In addition, the isotropic-nematic coexistence concentrations are measured as a function of ionic strength. The data compare well with a scaled functional theory assuming decoupling between the angular and spatial degrees of freedom.",

            "We have prepared a homologous series of filamentous viruses with varying contour length using molecular cloning techniques. These viruses are monodisperse enough to form a stable smectic phase. Two systems are studied. The first system consists of viruses to the surfaces of which the polymers are covalently bound. Through studies of the isotropic\u2013cholesteric phase transition we demonstrate that covalently attached polymers alter the effective diameter of the virus. Additionally, we have produced mixtures of viruses whose ratio of effective diameters varies by a factor of five. The second system is composed of mixtures of rod\u2013like viruses and non\u2013absorbing Gaussian polymers. With this system we study the kinetics of the isotropic\u2013smectic phase transition and describe observations of a number of novel metastable structures of unexpected complexity.",
