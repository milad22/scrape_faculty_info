Based upon the open\u2010source ISA framework, MetaboLights provides Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) compliant metadata and raw experimental data associated with metabolomics experiments. Users can upload their study datasets into the MetaboLights Repository. These studies are then automatically assigned a stable and unique identifier (e.g., MTBLS1) that can be used for publication reference. The MetaboLights Reference Layer associates metabolites with metabolomics studies in the archive and is extensively annotated with data fields such as structural and chemical information, NMR and MS spectra, target species, metabolic pathways, and reactions. The database is manually curated with no specific release \u2026",

            "MetaboLights is a database for metabolomics studies, their raw experimental data and associated metadata. The database is cross-species and cross-technique and it covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles and locations. MetaboLights is the recommended metabolomics repository for a number of leading journals and ELIXIR, the European infrastructure for life science information. In this article, we describe the significant updates that we have made over the last two years to the resource to respond to the increasing amount and diversity of data being submitted by the metabolomics community. We refreshed the website and most importantly, our submission process was completely overhauled to enable us to deliver a far more user-friendly submission process and to facilitate the growing demand for reproducibility and integration with other \u2018omics.

            "To the Editor: Over the past few years, as the use of mass spectrometry (MS) has increased, multiple spectral libraries, databases and software frameworks have been created to enable sharing and searching of MS data. However, finding all the spectra that correspond to a specific compound across different databases continues to be a challenge. A spectral identifier that improves the exchange of mass spectra, as well as provenance and duplicate detection, would address these issues and enhance searchability. MassBank1 (http:\/\/www. massbank. jp and http:\/\/massbank. eu\/MassBank\/) has been the source of data for other open libraries, such as the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking2 (GNPS) and Human Metabolome Database3 (HMDB) libraries as well as the MetaboLights reference layer4. In turn, HMDB and communitycontributed spectra from GNPS have also been imported into MassBank \u2026",

            "NMR spectroscopy is the most popular technique used for structure elucidation of small organic molecules in solution, but incorrect structures are regularly reported. One-bond proton-carbon J-couplings provide additional information about chemical structure because they are determined by different features of molecular structure than are proton and carbon chemical shifts. However, these couplings are not routinely used to validate proposed structures because few software tools exist to predict them. This study assesses the accuracy of Density Functional Theory for predicting them using 396 published experimental observations from a diverse range of small organic molecules. With the B3LYP functional and the TZVP basis set, Density Functional Theory calculations using the open-source software package NWChem can predict one-bond CH J-couplings with good accuracy for most classes of small organic molecule. The root-mean-square deviation after correction is 1.5 Hz for most sp3 CH pairs and 1.9 Hz for sp2 pairs; larger errors are observed for sp3 pairs with multiple electronegative substituents and for sp pairs. These results suggest that prediction of one-bond CH J-couplings by Density Functional Theory is sufficiently accurate for structure validation. This will be of particular use in strained ring systems and heterocycles which have characteristic couplings and which pose challenges for structure elucidation.",
