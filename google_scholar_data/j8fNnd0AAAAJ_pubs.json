            "Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B stars with circumstellar disks that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possible reasons for the rapid rotation of Be stars: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main\u2010sequence (MS) evolution of B stars. To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a photometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky. Of these, five clusters are probably not physically associated groups and our results for two other clusters are not reliable, but we identify 52 definite Be stars and an additional 129 Be candidates in the remaining clusters. We use our results to examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the Be phenomenon. We find an overall increase in the fraction of Be stars with age until 100 Myr, and Be stars are most common among the brightest, most massive B\u2010type stars above the \u2026",

Combining them and the spectra of the B stars from our previous investigations (~ 430 cluster and~ 100 field B stars) yields a large, homogeneous sample for studying the rotational properties of B stars. We derive the projected rotational velocity Vsin i, effective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed V crit for each star. We find that the average Vsin i is significantly lower among field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down than their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of V eq\/V crit for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B stars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B stars. However, the upper limit of V eq\/V crit that may separate normal B stars from emission-line Be stars (where rotation \u2026",

We derive fits of the four model parameters (disk base density, radial density exponent, disk normal inclination, and position angle) for each of the targets. The resulting densities are in broad agreement with prior studies of the IR excess flux, and the resulting orientations generally agree with those from interferometric H\u03b1 and continuum polarimetric observations.

            "We present results from a short series of blue, moderate\u2010resolution spectra of the microquasar binary SS 433. The observations were made at a time optimized to find the spectrum of the donor star, i.e., when the donor was in the foreground and well above the plane of the obscuring disk. In addition to the well\u2010known stationary and jet emission lines, we find evidence of a weak absorption spectrum that resembles that of an A\u2010type evolved star. These lines display radial velocity shifts opposite to those associated with the disk surrounding the compact star, and they appear strongest when the disk is maximally eclipsed. All these properties suggest that these absorption lines form in the atmosphere of the hitherto unseen mass donor star in SS 433. The radial velocity shifts observed are consistent with a mass ratio   and masses of   M\u2299 and   M\u2299. These results indicate that the system consists of an evolved, massive \u2026",
