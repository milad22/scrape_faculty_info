            "An imbalance between T helper cell (Th)1 and Th2\u2010like cytokines has been described in several chronic infectious diseases. We therefore analyzed the intrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Th1\u2010like (interleukin [IL]\u20102, interferon [IFN]\u2010gamma) and Th2\u2010like (IL\u20104, IL\u201010) cytokines in chronic hepatitis C patients (n = 17) and controls (n = 6) and correlated the results with liver histology and intrahepatic viral load. Intrahepatic cytokine mRNA and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA were quantitatively assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a dot\u2010 blot hybridization technique. Liver biopsy specimens were histologically graded using the Scheuer Score. IFN\u2010gamma and IL\u20102 mRNA expression were significantly upregulated in chronic HCV vs. controls (P < .002, P < .04, respectively). Both correlated significantly with histological fibrosis and portal tract inflammation. In contrast, the expression of IL\u201010 \u2026",

            "Real\u2010time quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) is the method of choice for rapid and reproducible measurements of cytokine or growth factor expression in small samples. Fluorescence detection methods for monitoring real\u2010time PCR include fluorogenic probes labelled with reporter and quencher dyes, such as Taqman probes or Molecular Beacons and the dsDNA\u2010binding dye SYBR Green I. Fluorogenic (Taqman) probes for a range of human and rat cytokines and growth factors were tested for sensitivity and compared with an assay for SYBR Green I quantification using real\u2010time fluorescence monitoring (PE Applied Biosystems Model 7700 sequence detector). SYBR Green I detection involved analysis of the melting temperature of the PCR product and measurement of fluorescence at the optimum temperature. Fluorogenic probes provided sensitive and reproducible \u2026",
