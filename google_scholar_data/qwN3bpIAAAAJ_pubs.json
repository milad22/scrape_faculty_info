            "The advent of ultraintense laser pulses generated by the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) along with the development of high-fluence laser materials has opened up an entirely new field of optics. The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of 10 18 W\u2215 cm 2, lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt. A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the direction of laser propagation. One of the consequences of this is wakefield generation, a relativistic version of optical rectification, in which longitudinal field effects could be as large as the transverse ones \u2026",

In its early life, the laser was associated with the physics of electron volts and of the chemical bond. Over the past fifteen years, however, we have seen a surge in our ability to produce high intensities, 5 to 6 orders of magnitude higher than was possible before. At these intensities, particles, electrons, and protons acquire kinetic energy in the megaelectron-volt range through interaction with intense laser fields. This opens a new age for the laser, the age of nonlinear relativistic optics coupling even with nuclear physics.

            "The physics of plasmas is an extremely rich and complex subject as the variety of topics addressed in this book demonstrates. This richness and complexity demands new and powerful techniques for investigating plasma physics. An outgrowth from his graduate course teaching, now with corrections, Tajima's text provides not only a lucid introduction to computational plasma physics, but also offers the reader many examples of the way numerical modeling, properly handled, can provide valuable physical understanding of the nonlinear aspects so often encountered in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Included here are computational methods for modern nonlinear physics as applied to hydrodynamic turbulence, solitons, fast reconnection of magnetic fields, anomalous transports, dynamics of the sun, and more. The text contains examples of problems now solved using computational techniques including those concerning finite-size particles, spectral techniques, implicit differencing, gyrokinetic approaches, and particle simulation.",

            "The challenge of producing the next generation of particle accelerators, for both fundamental research at laboratories such as CERN and more applied tasks such as proton therapy and nuclear transmutation, has been taken up by the high-intensity laser community. With the advent of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) in 19851 came the ability to generate ultrashort laser pulses with intensities in excess of 1018 W cm\u20132. At these intensities, the electromagnetic field drives electrons into relativistic motion, opening the door to useful effects like wakefield acceleration2 and hard X-ray production by bremsstrahlung, Compton or betatron emission3. Ion motion becomes relativistic4 at intensities above 1022 W cm\u20132\u2014an intensity regime demonstrated or anticipated with development projects for very-large-scale lasers like the HERCULES laser at the University of Michigan in the USA, which has generated some of the \u2026",
