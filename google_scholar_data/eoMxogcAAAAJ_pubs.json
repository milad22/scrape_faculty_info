The models are an improved and extended version of the data set previously published by Leitherer & Heckman. We have upgraded our code by implementing the latest set of stellar evolution models of the Geneva group and the model atmosphere grid compiled by Lejeune et al. Several predictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown here for the first time. The models are presented in a homogeneous way for five metallicities between   and 0.001 and three choices of the initial mass function. The age coverage is 106\u2013109 yr. We also show the spectral energy distributions which are used to compute colors and other quantities.

We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z= 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3\u00d7 10 10 M\u2609 reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the S\u00e9rsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, S\u00e9rsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly \u2026",

            "SN 1997D in NGC 1536 is possibly the least luminous and energetic Type II supernova discovered to date. The entire light curve is subluminous, never reaching M V=-14.65. The radioactive tail follows the 56 Co decay slope. In the case of a nearly complete trapping of the \u03b3-rays, the 56 Ni mass derived from the tail brightness is extremely small,~ 0.002 M\u2609. At discovery, the spectra showed a red continuum and line velocities on the order of 1000 km s\u2212 1. The luminosity and the photospheric expansion velocity suggest that the explosion occurred about 50 days before discovery and that a plateau probably followed. Model light curves and spectra of the explosion of a 26 M\u2609 star successfully fitted the observations. Low-mass models are inconsistent with the observations. The radius of the progenitor, constrained by the prediscovery upper limits, is R 0 lesssim 300 R\u2609. A low explosion energy of~ 4\u00d7 10 50 ergs is \u2026",
