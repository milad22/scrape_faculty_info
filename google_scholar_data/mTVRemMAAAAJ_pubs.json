The exact symmetry of the Lagrangian with local quartic terms for the Dirac four-component field dictated by the lattice is identified as D 2\u00d7 U c (1)\u00d7 time reversal, where D 2 is the dihedral group, and U c (1) is a subgroup of the SU c (2)\u201cchiral\u201d group of the noninteracting Lagrangian that represents translations in Dirac language. The Lagrangian describing spinless particles respecting this symmetry is parametrized by six independent coupling constants.

Twisted bilayer graphene, near the so-called \u201cmagic angles\u201d, features slow Dirac fermions close to the charge-neutrality point that persist up to high energies. Starting from a continuum model of slow but strongly interacting Dirac fermions, we show that with increasing chemical doping away from the charge-neutrality point, a time-reversal symmetry breaking, valley pseudospin-triplet, topological p+ i p superconductor gradually sets in, when the system resides at the brink of an antiferromagnetic ordering (due to Hubbard repulsion), in qualitative agreement with recent experimental findings.

An n th-order HOT phase accommodates zero modes on a surface with codimension n. We exemplify these scenarios for prototypical three-dimensional gapless systems, such as a nodal-loop semimetal possessing SU (2) spin-rotational symmetry, and Dirac semimetals, transforming under (pseudo) spin-1 2 or 1 representations. The former system permits an unprecedented realization of a fourth-order phase, without any surface zero modes. Our construction can be generalized to HOT insulators and \u2026",

At stronger disorder, the Weyl semimetal undergoes a quantum phase transition and enter into a metallic phase. The mean density of states at zero energy serves as the order parameter and displays single-parameter scaling across such a disorder driven quantum phase transition.
