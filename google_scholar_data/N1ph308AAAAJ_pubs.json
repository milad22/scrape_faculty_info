            "Understanding hydroxide solvation and transport in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) can provide important insight into the design principles of these new membranes. To accurately model hydroxide solvation and transport, we developed a new multiscale reactive molecular dynamics model for hydroxide in aqueous solution, which was then subsequently modified for an AEM material. With this model, we investigated the hydroxide solvation structure and transport mechanism in the membrane. We found that a relatively even separation of the rigid side chains produces a continuous overlapping region for hydroxide transport that is made up of the first hydration shell of the tethered cationic groups. Our results show that hydroxide has a significant preference for this overlapping region, transporting through it and between the AEM side chains with substantial contributions from both vehicular (standard diffusion \u2026",

Although some deleterious recessive mutations may be eliminated during growth of haploid gametophytes and functionally haploid early embryos (\u201chaplosufficiency quality-checking\u201d), the multiplicity of plant genome-maintenance systems suggests aggressive quality control during prior diploid growth. To test in Arabidopsis a hypothesis that prior mismatch repair (MMR) is paramount in defense of plant genetic fidelity, we propagated in parallel 36 MMR-defective (Atmsh2-1) and 36 wild-type lines. The Atmsh2-1 lines rapidly accumulated a wide variety of mutations: fifth-generation (G5) plants showed abnormalities in morphology and development, fertility, germination efficiency, seed\/silique development, and seed set \u2026",

These simulations capture the dynamic bond breaking and formation processes (charge defect delocalization) that are important for correctly describing the solvation and transport of these complex species. The excess proton is found to be attracted to the interface, which is correlated with a favorable enthalpic contribution and consistent with reducing the disruption in the hydrogen bond network caused by the ion complex.

These inherently multiscale problems require computationally efficient and accurate methods to converge statistical properties. In this paper, a method is presented that uses data directly from condensed phase ab initio simulations to develop reactive molecular dynamics models that do not require predefined empirical functions. Instead, the interactions used in the reactive model are expressed as linear combinations of interpolating functions that are optimized by using a linear least-squares algorithm. One notable benefit of the procedure outlined here is the capability to minimize the number of parameters requiring nonlinear optimization.

The resulting configurations were found to properly sample the canonical ensemble. The dielectric constant of ice Ih was determined from the net dipole fluctuation of the ice configurations. The calculated dielectric constant compares favorably with the study by Rick and Haymet [J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 118, 9291].

We also experimentally measured the self-diffusion constant of fluoride in a diblock copolymer that has the same hydrophilic block and found satisfactory agreement with simulations within a factor of 2. At 300 K, our simulations showed that the self-diffusion constant of fluoride increases by about 70% when fluoride content decreases from 100% to 40% (and 60% Cl), and it increases by about 140% when fluoride content decreases from 100% to 10%. Increasing % Cl also slightly decreases the attraction between fluoride and the cations.

We assess Trp-cage folding by monitoring root mean square deviation from the crystallographic structure, radius of gyration, proline cis\/trans isomerization state, protein secondary structure, amino acid contact formation and distance, and native and non-native contact formation. Starting from an unfolded configuration, Trp-cage folds in water at 298 K in less than 500 ns of simulation, but has very little mobility in the ionic liquid at the same temperature, which can be ascribed to the higher ionic liquid viscosity.
