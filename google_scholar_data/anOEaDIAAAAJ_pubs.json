            "We calculate logarithmic negativity, a quantum entanglement measure for mixed quantum states, in quantum error-correcting codes and find it to equal the minimal cross sectional area of the entanglement wedge in holographic codes with a quantum correction term equal to the logarithmic negativity between the bulk degrees of freedom on either side of the entanglement wedge cross section. This leads us to conjecture a holographic dual for logarithmic negativity that is related to the area of a cosmic brane with tension in the entanglement wedge plus a quantum correction term. This is closely related to (though distinct from) the holographic proposal for entanglement of purification. We check this relation for various configurations of subregions in AdS 3\/CFT 2. These are disjoint intervals at zero temperature, as well as a single interval and adjacent intervals at finite temperature. We also find this prescription to \u2026",

We study free fermion, compact boson, and holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) as well as numerical simulations of random unitary circuits and integrable and chaotic spin chains. The holographic behavior strongly deviates from known non-holographic CFT results and displays clear signatures of maximal scrambling. Intriguingly, the random unitary circuits display nearly identical behavior to the holographic channels. Generically, we find the \u201cline-tension picture\u201d to effectively capture the entanglement dynamics for chaotic systems and the \u201cquasi-particle picture\u201d for integrable systems.

Consequently, we can use the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and its generalizations to mixed state entanglement measures to test highly nontrivial consistency conditions. In general, the agreement between bulk and boundary quantities requires the equivalence of partition functions on manifolds of arbitrary genus.

We construct an explicit contour function for Gaussian states using the fermionic partial-transpose. We generalize this contour function to generic many-body systems using a natural combination of derivatives of the logarithmic negativity. Though the latter negativity contour function is not strictly positive for all quantum systems, it is simple to compute and produces reasonable and interesting results. In particular, it rigorously satisfies the positivity condition for all holographic states and those obeying the quasi-particle picture. We apply this formalism to quantum field theories with a Fermi surface, contrasting the entanglement structure of Fermi liquids and holographic (hyperscale violating) non-Fermi liquids. The analysis of non-Fermi liquids show anomalous temperature dependence of the negativity depending on the dynamical critical exponent. We further compute the negativity contour following a quantum quench and discuss how this may clarify certain aspects of thermalization.",
