            "In this study, we have successfully developed a facile method for the high-yield fabrication of Au\u2212Pd core\u2212shell heterostructures with an unusual tetrahexahedral (THH) morphology using Au nanocubes as the structure-directing cores. The lattice orientations of the Au nanocubes match those of the Pd shells. Structural analysis establishes that the THH nanocrystals are bounded by high-index {730} facets. A substantial lattice mismatch between Au and Pd, oxidative etching in the presence of chloride and oxygen, the use of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surfactant, and the reaction temperature (30\u221260 \u00b0C) were identified to be key factors facilitating the formation of the THH core\u2212shell nanocrystals. Intermediate products have also been examined to follow the growth process. By selecting cubic gold cores with sizes of 30\u221270 nm and varying the volume of the gold core solution used, THH Au\u2212Pd core\u2212shell \u2026",

Both electrochemically preanodized and oxygen plasma treated SPCEs were adopted for the purpose of partially differentiating these two effects. Raman and XPS analyses verify that different treatment can indeed induce different surface characteristics. The electrocatalytic activity thereby increases by the substantial increase in surface bound carbon\u2013oxygen functional groups and\/or the generation of edge plane sites through surface reorientation. Possible mechanism is proposed to explain the voltammetric behavior. The peaks for dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid are especially well-resolved from each other at the electrochemically preanodized SPCE and simultaneous detection at neutral pH can \u2026",

The preanodization procedure makes the SPCE more electroactive towards NADH oxidation with a decrease of \u223c300 mV in the overpotential without electrode fouling. It is proposed that surface reorientation to generate more edge plane sites during the preanodization procedure, as confirmed by a distinctive Raman band at \u223c1360 cm\u22121, is the main cause for the facilitated electron transfer for the oxidation of NADH. Presence of large excess of ascorbic acid does not interfere the detection of NADH and the SPCE* shows individual voltammetric peaks for ascorbic acid and NADH. Under optimized conditions, the obtained calibration plot shows a linear range up to 100 \u03bcM \u2026",
