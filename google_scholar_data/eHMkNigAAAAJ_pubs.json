            "A golden age for heavy-quarkonium physics dawned a decade ago, initiated by the confluence of exciting advances in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and an explosion of related experimental activity. The early years of this period were chronicled in the Quarkonium Working Group (QWG) CERN Yellow Report (YR) in 2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that time and provided specific recommendations for further progress. However, the broad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles could only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII program concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the B-factories and CLEO-c flourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the Tevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the deconfinement regime. All these experiments leave \u2026",

The accuracy of the new data on deep inelastic scattering structure functions obtained by the very high statistics NMC and CCFR experiments provides unprecedented sensitivity to the flavor dependence of the sea-quark distributions. In addition to much better determination of the small-x dependence of all parton distributions, we found:(i) the strange quark distribution is much softer than the non-strange sea quarks and rises above the latter at small-x; and (ii) the difference d-u changes sign as a function of x. A few alternative sets of viable distributions with conventional assumptions are also discussed.",

With a simple model for these matrix elements, leading-order asymmetries calculated from QCD are consistent with data on pion production from Fermilab, and can be used to predict single-spin asymmetries at BNL RHIC.
