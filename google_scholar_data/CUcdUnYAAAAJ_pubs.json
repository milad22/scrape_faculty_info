            "We demonstrate optical orientation in Ge\/SiGe quantum wells and study their spin properties. The ultrafast electron transfer from the center of the Brillouin zone to its edge allows us to achieve high spin polarizations and to resolve the spin dynamics of holes and electrons. The circular polarization degree of the direct gap photoluminescence exceeds the theoretical bulk limit, yielding\u223c 37% and\u223c 85% for transitions with heavy and light holes states, respectively. The spin lifetime of holes at the top of the valence band is estimated to be\u223c 0.5 ps and it is governed by transitions between light and heavy hole states. Electrons at the bottom of the conduction band, on the other hand, have a spin lifetime that exceeds 5 ns below 150 K. Theoretical analysis of the spin relaxation indicates that phonon-induced intervalley scattering dictates the spin lifetime of electrons.",

            "A novel global flux surface hopping (GFSH) approach is proposed. In this method, the surface hopping probabilities rely on the gross population flow between states, rather than the state-to-state flux as in the standard fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH). GFSH captures the superexchange mechanism of population transfer, while FSSH lacks this capability. In other aspects, including minimization of the number of hops, internal consistency, velocity rescaling, and detailed balance, the GFSH algorithm is similar to FSSH. The advantages of GFSH are demonstrated with a model 3-level system and an Auger process in a semiconductor quantum dot. Current studies indicate that GFSH can replace FSSH, but further tests are needed.",

In the majority of cases, depending on the process under investigation, the electronic structure component of the calculation constitutes the computation bottleneck. We developed an efficient approach for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD) of large systems in the framework of the self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) method. SCC-DFTB is combined with the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) and decoherence induced surface hopping (DISH) techniques for NA-MD. The approach is implemented within the Python extension for the ab initio dynamics (PYXAID) simulation package, which is an open source NA-MD program designed to handle nanoscale materials. The accuracy of the developed approach is tested with ab initio DFT and \u2026",

Increasing the size of metal nanoparticles in an array can introduce ultrasharp lattice plasmon resonances with out-of-plane charge oscillations that are tolerant to lateral strain. By patterning these nanoparticles onto an elastomeric slab surrounded by liquid gain, we realized reversible, tunable nanolasing with high strain sensitivity and no hysteresis. Our semiquantum modeling demonstrates that lasing build-up occurs at the hybrid quadrupole electromagnetic hot spots, which provides a route toward mechanical modulation of light-matter interactions on the nanoscale.",

The elusive phonon bottleneck is hard to achieve, in particular, due to Auger-type energy exchange between electrons and holes. The Auger channel can be suppressed by hole trapping. Using time-domain ab initio simulation, we show that deep hole traps cannot fully eliminate the Auger channel. The simulations show that the hole-mediated electron relaxation is slowed down only by about 30%, which is in agreement with the recent experiments. The Auger energy exchange and hole relaxation to the trap state occur on similar time scales. Hole trapping is slow, because holes themselves experience a weak bottleneck effect. The study establishes the fundamental mechanisms of the electron and \u2026",

We show that the resulting transition probabilities simplify to the quantum state populations derived from the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, reducing to the rapidly switching surface hopping approach of Tully and Preston. The resulting surface hopping scheme is simple and appeals to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

A particular focus of this work is the influence of dephasing in the quantum dynamics on the emission intensity at the threshold for lasing. We find that dephasing in the quantum system leads to reduced lasing emission, but with little effect on the long-term population inversion.
