            "Developing a low-carbon electricity system is a key measure to meet the challenge of global warming and socioeconomic sustainable development. Decarbonization of power generation will be a critical option for CO (2) emission mitigation. In this paper, after describing the factors of low-carbon economy and their effects on generation planning, a model for generation expansion planning based on the carbon emission trajectory model is proposed under low-carbon economy. The new model integrates and formulates some low-carbon factors such as the cost of low-carbon power technology, carbon trading cost and the penalties for excess carbon emission based on the carbon emission trajectory model and considers the constraint of the CO (2) reduction targets. An actual case is studies based on one provincial grid in China by applying the proposed model and the results prove it to be more adaptable and \u2026",
