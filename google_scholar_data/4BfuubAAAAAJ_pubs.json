It is written in the Python language with some performance\u2010critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis.

In ion channels  and water-conducting pores (aquaporins), one-dimensional confinement in  conjunction with strong surface effects changes the physical behavior of  water. In molecular dynamics simulations of water in short (0.8 nm)  hydrophobic pores the water density in the pore fluctuates on a nanosecond  time scale. In long simulations (460 ns in total) at pore radii ranging from  0.35 to 1.0 nm we quantify the kinetics of oscillations between a  liquid-filled and a vapor-filled pore. This behavior can be explained as  capillary evaporation alternating with capillary condensation, driven by  pressure fluctuations in the water outside the pore. The free-energy  difference between the two states depends linearly on the radius. The  free-energy landscape shows how a metastable liquid state gradually develops  with increasing radius.

Biological nanopores are frequently gated, i.e., they switch between an open and a closed state. In several ion channel structures the gate is formed by a ring of hydrophobic side chains that do not physically occlude the pore. Here we investigate whether a hydrophobic pore can act as a gate via molecular dynamics simulations of the passage of water through atomistic models of nanopores embedded within a membrane mimetic. Both the geometry of a nanopore and the hydrophilicity vs hydrophobicity of its lining determine whether water enters the channel. For purely hydrophobic pores there is an abrupt transition from a closed state (no water in the pore cavity) to an open state (cavity water at approximately bulk density) once a critical pore radius is exceeded.

Here, we report the crystal structure of an inward-facing conformation of Mhp1 at 3.8 angstroms resolution, complementing its previously described structures in outward-facing and occluded states. From analyses of the three structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism for the transport cycle in Mhp1. Switching from the outward- to the inward-facing state, to effect the inward release of sodium and benzylhydantoin, is primarily achieved by a rigid body movement of transmembrane helices 3, 4, 8, and 9 relative to the rest of the protein. This forms the basis of an alternating access mechanism applicable to many transporters of this emerging superfamily.",

This hydrophobic gating mechanism is thought to operate in a number of ion channels, eg the nicotinic receptor, bacterial mechanosensitive channels (MscL and MscS) and perhaps in some potassium channels (eg KcsA, MthK and KvAP). Simplified pore models allow one to investigate the primary characteristics of a conduction pathway, namely its geometry (shape, pore length, and radius), the chemical character of the pore wall surface, and its local flexibility and surface roughness. Our extended (about 0.1 \u00b5s) molecular dynamic simulations show that a short hydrophobic pore is closed to water for radii smaller than 0.45 nm. By increasing the polarity of the pore wall (and thus reducing its hydrophobicity) the transition radius can be decreased until for \u2026",

We quantify this barrier to ion permeation by calculating the potential of mean force from umbrella-sampled molecular dynamics simulations and compare them to continuum-electrostatic Poisson\u2212Boltzmann calculations. The latter fail to describe the ion barrier because they do not account for the properties of water in the pore. The barrier originates from the energetic cost to desolvate the ion. Even in wide pores, which could accommodate an ion and its hydration shell, a barrier of several kT remains because the liquid water phase is not stable in the hydrophobic pore.
