An inflection point in M (H, T= 0.7 K) at half saturation, M s\/2, is described by an effective XXZ chain. The data exhibit universal scaling behavior in the vicinity of H c 1 and H c 2, indicating that the system is near a quantum critical point.",

Due to its expected superfluid-like properties, this state of matter is called a supersolid. To date, no unambiguous supersolid 4He state has been observed. Potential future extensions of the experiments are discussed.",

            "Langmuir\u2212Blodgett (LB) films of a series of divalent metal octadecylphosphonates have been prepared and characterized. The films are each shown to be LB analogs of known solid-state metal phosphonates possessing 2-dimensional ionic\u2212covalent metal phosphonate layers. The metal phosphonate layers crystallize during the LB deposition process. Films were characterized with XPS, X-ray diffraction, ellipsometry, attenuated total reflectance FTIR, and, in the case of the manganese film, SQUID magnetometry. Octadecylphosphonate films with Mn2+, Mg2+, and Cd2+ form with the stoichiometry M(O3PC17H37)\u00b7H2O and have metal phosphonate bonding consistent with the analogous M(O3PR)\u00b7H2O layered solids. The Ca2+ film forms as Ca(HO3PC18H37)2, which is also a known solid-state phase. Magnetic measurements reveal that the manganese octadecylphosphonate film undergoes a magnetic ordering \u2026",
