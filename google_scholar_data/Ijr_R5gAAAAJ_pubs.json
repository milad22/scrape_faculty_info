            "Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images\/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed \u2026",

            "Modulation of the acetylation state of histones plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysines near the N termini of histones. This reaction promotes the condensation of chromatin, leading to repression of transcription. HDAC deregulation has been linked to several types of cancer, suggesting a potential use for HDAC inhibitors in oncology. Here we describe the first crystal structures of a human HDAC: the structures of human HDAC8 complexed with four structurally diverse hydroxamate inhibitors. This work sheds light on the catalytic mechanism of the HDACs, and on differences in substrate specificity across the HDAC family. The structure also suggests how phosphorylation of Ser39 affects HDAC8 activity.",

The N-terminal region is highly homologous among the STAT proteins and surrounds a completely conserved arginine residue. Here we demonstrate arginine methylation of STAT1 by the protein arginine methyl-transferase PRMT1 as a novel requirement for IFN\u03b1\/\u03b2-induced transcription. Methyl-thioadenosine, a methyl-transferase inhibitor that accumulates in many transformed cells, inhibits STAT1-mediated IFN responses. This inhibition arises from impaired STAT1-DNA binding due to an increased association of the STAT inhibitor PIAS1 with phosphorylated STAT1 dimers in the absence of arginine methylation. Thus, arginine methylation of STAT1 is an additional posttranslational modification regulating transcription factor function, and alteration of arginine methylation might be responsible for \u2026",

Our lecture notes were also used by Prof. Zhenhuan Teng in his graduate course at Peking University.The overall emphasis of the present book is to present some basic spectral and high-order algorithms together with applications to some linear and nonlinear problems that one frequently encounters in practice. The algorithms in the book are presented in a pseudocode format or with MATLAB or FORTRAN codes that contain additional details beyond the mathematical formulas. The reader can easily write computer routines based on the pseudocodes in any standard computer language. We believe that the readers learn and understand numerical methods best by seeing how algorithms are developed from the mathematical theory and then writing and testing computer implementations of them. For those interested in the numerical analysis of the spectral methods, we have also provided self-contained error analysis for some basic spectral-Galerkin algorithms presented in the book. Our aim is to provide a sufficient background on the implementation and analysis of spectral and high-order methods so that the readers can approach the current research literature with the necessary tools and understanding.",

This paper considers two cases for the MD, i.e., fixed CPU frequency and elastic CPU frequency. Since these problems are NP-hard, we propose a linear relaxation-based approach and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based approach for the fixed CPU frequency case, and an exhaustive search-based approach and an SDR-based approach for the elastic CPU frequency case. Our simulation results show that the SDR-based algorithms achieve near optimal performance.

Since the mid-1980s, dietary fat intervention studies have been conducted to investigate the  effect of fat intake on endogenous estrogen levels. To further our understanding of the possible  relationship between dietary fat and breast cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of dietary fat  intervention studies that investigated serum estradiol levels, and we reviewed the nature of the  evidence provided by prospective analytic studies of fat consumption and breast cancer risk.  METHODS: A computerized search of the English language literature on estrogen\/estradiol and  dietary fat intervention studies published from January 1966 through June 1998 was conducted  using the MEDLINE\u00ae database. Pooled estimates were derived from the change in estradiol  levels associated with fat reduction from 13 studies. Analyses \u2026",

The oxidation of allylic systems has played a prominent role in this context as possibly the most widely applied C\u2013H functionalization, owing to the utility of enones and allylic alcohols as versatile intermediates, and their prevalence in natural and unnatural materials 2. Allylic oxidations have featured in hundreds of syntheses, including some natural product syntheses regarded as \u201cclassics\u201d 3. Despite many attempts to improve the efficiency and practicality of this transformation, the majority of conditions still use highly toxic reagents (based around toxic elements such as chromium or selenium) or expensive catalysts (such as palladium or rhodium) 2. These requirements are problematic in industrial settings \u2026",

            "Methylation is one of the many post-translational modifications that modulate protein function. Although asymmetricNG,NG-dimethylation of arginine residues in glycine-arginine-rich domains of eucaryotic proteins, catalyzed by type I protein arginineN-methyltransferases (PRMT), has been known for some time, members of this enzyme class have only recently been cloned. The first example of this type of enzyme, designated PRMT1, cloned because of its ability to interact with the mammalian TIS21 immediate-early protein, was then shown to have protein arginine methyltransferase activity. We have now isolated rat and human cDNA orthologues that encode proteins with substantial sequence similarity to PRMT1. A recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion product of this new rat protein, named PRMT3, asymmetrically dimethylates arginine residues present both in the designed substrate GST-GAR and \u2026",
