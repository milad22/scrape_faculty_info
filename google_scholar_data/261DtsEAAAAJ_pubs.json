            "Outsourcing is a form of strategic alliance that has increased in popularity over the past decade. However, there has been limited research that studies the design of management control systems (MCS) and the role of trust in such inter-firm relationships. This paper draws on a model by van der Meer-Kooistra and Vosselman [Acc. Organ. Society 25 (2001) 51] to examine how control mechanisms and trust are used to achieve control in a single case study of an electricity company and its outsourced IT operations. An analysis of the characteristics of the transaction, environment and parties, indicated that the control strategy adopted appeared to be a trust based pattern of control, rather than a market based or bureaucratic based pattern. Control was achieved through outcome controls and social controls developing over time, and through the development of trust, particularly goodwill trust. This paper adds to the \u2026",

            "In recent years, several papers in leading accounting journals have speculated on the future directions of management accounting research. Within this general environment of criticism and uncertainty, some writers have called on management accounting researchers to make greater use of structural equation modeling (SEM) to provide simultaneous tests of measurement reliability and structural relations, which may overcome some of the limitations that have been leveled at the way that management accounting has used more traditional statistical techniques. There are three objectives underlying this paper. The first objective is to demonstrate some advantages that latent variable SEM may offer over the well-established techniques of multiple regression analysis and path analysis to advance the theoretical development of management accounting.

Social capital provides a comprehensive framework for examining the nature of social connections through its focus on both structural networks (bridging) and interpersonal relationships that predispose individuals towards mutually beneficial collective action (bonding). In doing so, social capital provides a means of considering how individuals react to management control systems in terms of the social ties that exist both within the organization and external to the organization. Using a case study of a non-government organization, we show how social capital is implicated in efforts to attract economic capital and cultural capital.

Recent arguments in the organizational behavior literature have emphasized the importance of developing a more complete understanding of PC (Irving et al. 1997; Meyer and Allen 1997). Research has demonstrated empirically the existence of multiple dimensions of PC and found that they relate differently to important affective and behavioral outcomes (Meyer et al. 1993; Irving et al. 1997). Despite these developments, no published studies have examined the existence and\/or effects of multiple dimensions of accountants' PC.

Mentoring is one initiative that has been suggested as a means of reducing the high costs associated with employee turnover. However, prior accounting research examining the association between mentoring and turnover intentions has produced mixed results, which may be due, at least in part, to difficulties in operationalizing the mentoring construct. Drawing on recent management literature regarding organizational turnover intentions, we challenge the conventional view that mentoring generally leads to reduced turnover intentions, by testing a theoretical model that posits that different functions of mentoring have differing effects on turnover intentions.
