            "This paper presents the results of a functional-integral approach to the dynamics of a two-state system coupled to a dissipative environment. It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the\" spin-boson\" problem;(2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem;(3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space \u2026",

The properties of the quantum nonlinear \u03c3 model are analyzed approximately using the one-loop renormalization-group method. When the model has long-range order at T= 0, the long-wavelength behavior at finite temperatures can be described by a purely classical model, with parameters renormalized by the quantum fluctuations. The low-temperature behavior of the correlation length and the static and dynamic staggered-spin-correlation functions for the quantum antiferromagnet can be predicted, in principle, with no adjustable parameters, from the results of simulations of the classical model on a lattice \u2026",

The transition to this state is rounded by disorder, but in the limit that the disorder is made sufficiently small, the pseudogap crossover should reveal itself to be such a transition. The ordered state breaks time-reversal, translational, and rotational symmetries, but it is invariant under the combination of any two. We discuss these ideas in the context of ten specific experimental properties of the cuprates, and make several predictions, including the existence of an as-yet undetected metal-metal transition under the superconducting dome.",

In this paper, we present a theory of weak localization which is put rigorously on a quasiclassical basis thus providing a more intuitive understanding. For example, it becomes apparent that much of the underlying physics is a result of quantum mechanical interference effects in a very elementary sense. It is one of those unique cases where the superposition principle of quantum mechanics leads to observable consequences in the properties of macroscopic systems. In addition, all the important quantitative results obtained so far are recovered in the present quasiclassical approach.",

Provided that the competing exchange is moderately large but smaller than the critical value required to produce a gap in the excitation spectrum without lattice dimerization, the model agrees with a variety of experimental properties. It is argued that competing exchange interactions are a general feature of organic charge transfer compounds, and that they increase the temperature at which a spin-Peierls transition takes place.",
