            "Cisplatin is a widely used and highly effective cancer chemotherapeutic agent. One of the limiting side effects of cisplatin use is nephrotoxicity. Research over the past 10 years has uncovered many of the cellular mechanisms which underlie cisplatin-induced renal cell death. It has also become apparent that inflammation provoked by injury to renal epithelial cells serves to amplify kidney injury and dysfunction in vivo. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of cisplatin nephrotoxicity and discusses how these advances might lead to more effective prevention. View Full-Text",

            "The purpose of these studies was to examine the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Injection of mice with cisplatin (20 mg\/kg) led to severe renal failure. The expression of cytokines, chemokines, and ICAM-1 in kidney was measured by ribonuclease protection assays and RT-PCR. We found significant upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, RANTES, MIP-2, MCP-1, TCA3, IL-1\u03b2, and ICAM-1 in kidneys from cisplatin-treated animals. In addition, serum, kidney, and urine levels of TNF-\u03b1 measured by ELISA were increased by cisplatin. Inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1 production (GM6001, pentoxifylline) and TNF-\u03b1 Ab\u2019s reduced serum and kidney TNF-\u03b1 protein levels and also blunted the cisplatin-induced increases in TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, RANTES, MIP-2, MCP-1, and IL-1\u03b2, but not ICAM-1, mRNA.

In this study, we  examined the effect of cisplatin on the expression of TNF receptors TNFR1 and  TNFR2 in the kidney and the role of each receptor in mediating cisplatin  nephrotoxicity.

            "Cisplatin is an important chemotherapeutic agent but can cause acute renal injury. Part of this acute renal injury is mediated through tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The pathway through which cisplatin mediates the production of TNF-\u03b1 and injury is not known. Cisplatin activates p38 MAPK and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. p38 MAPK activation leads to increased production of TNF-\u03b1 in ischemic injury and in macrophages. However, little is known concerning the role of p38 MAPK in cisplatin-induced renal injury. Therefore, we examined the effect of cisplatin on p38 MAPK activity and the role of p38 MAPK in mediating cisplatin-induced TNF-\u03b1 production and renal injury. In vitro, cisplatin caused a dose-dependent activation of p38 MAPK in proximal tubule cells. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activation led to inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production.

            "Salicylate reduces cisplatin nephrotoxicity by inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1.Salicylate was recently shown to provide protection against cisplatin nephrotoxicity in rats. We have demonstrated that enhanced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production mediates, in part, cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to determine if the protective effects of salicylate were mediated through inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 in vivo and to explore the mechanism of inhibition in vitro.The effects of treatment with cisplatin alone and in combination with sodium salicylate in mice on renal function, histology, and gene expression were determined. The effects of cisplatin and salicylate on TNF-\u03b1 expression, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activity, and apoptosis were determined in vitro using cultured murine proximal tubule cells.Salicylate significantly reduced both the functional and histologic evidence \u2026",

            "Inflammatory cytokines in acute renal failure. A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to toxin-induced acute renal failure as well as ischemia\/reperfusion injury. A role for tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in mediating the inflammatory injury in cisplatin-induced acute renal failure has recently been established. Cisplatin induces the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF receptor subtype 2 (TNFR2) within the kidney. Genetic deletion of either TNF-\u03b1 or TNFR2 substantially reduces cisplatin-induced renal failure and also necrosis and apoptosis within the kidney. Studies will be required to determine if pharmacologic inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 might reduce cisplatin-induced renal failure in humans.",
