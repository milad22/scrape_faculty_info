            "This article compares entrepreneurial intention and its antecedents in two diverse economic and cultural contexts: Senegal and Spain. Starting from the Theory of Planned Behavior, a tailor-made instrument is developed and used to measure the entrepreneurial intention of a sample of 810 individuals from both countries. Findings indicate the existence of cultural differences between both countries in the determination of entrepreneurial intention. Spain showed personal attitude as the main antecedent, whereas in Senegal, it was perceived behavioral control. Moreover, the results appear to indicate that in contexts of less economic development, like Senegal, the role of the perceived social pressure (subjective norms) to carry out or not an entrepreneurial behavior loses its capacity to explain entrepreneurial intentions.",

            "The entrepreneurial potential of a region is a key factor in linking innovation to the market, thus leading to economic growth. This is especially important in peripheral regions that are characterized by low innovative dynamism. This paper analyses the entrepreneurial process in a European peripheral region, the Canary Islands, Spain. It attempts to determine possible cultural specificities and the role of motivation in the entrepreneurial process. To do this, an analysis of entrepreneurial intention (EI) is framed within the theory of planned behaviour and using motivation, opportunity and ability theory. An empirical study was carried out using a sample of 1457 university students participating in the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students\u2019 Survey project. Results indicate that motivation influences EI directly and indirectly through an individual\u2019s attitude towards entrepreneurial behaviour. The perception of \u2026",

            "Despite hotels\u2019 managers spend substantial time and money on environmental initiatives; they are not sure whether their guests perceive their green efforts appropriately. The purpose of this study is to analyze guests\u2019 perceptions of hotels\u2019 environmental practices expressed through social media. Main results suggest that even though customers perceive green efforts regarding six items: Energy, Water, Purchasing, Waste, Site and Education & Innovation, they do not discern hotels' level of environmental commitment. Moreover, guests' perceptions of hotel efforts in environmentally friendly practices do not significantly differ by the mode of travel nor by the reviewer's experience in travel platforms. A relevant implication is that the communication about environmentally friendly practices needs to be redesigned and intensified by hotel managers in order to take advantage of these efforts.",

The islands\u2019 fragile socioeconomic systems and scarce resources noticeably condition the competitiveness of their firms. An empirical analysis ranks environmental protection practices in SMEs and identifies differences on the basis of size and business sector. In addition, groups of firms with different environmental behavior are identified to facilitate the design of environmental policies, improve effectiveness in decision making and the more efficient use of resources. From a theoretical perspective, this paper contributes to the gap identified by the precursors of the Natural Resource-Based View of the firm by analyzing specific resource combinations that each firm can use to improve its environmental performance and achieve competitive advantages.
