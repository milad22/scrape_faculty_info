            "Phase slips are topological fluctuations that carry the superconducting order-parameter field between distinct current-carrying states. Owing to these phase slips, superconducting nanowires acquire electrical resistance. In such wires, it is well known that at higher temperatures phase slips occur through the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the order-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that phase slips should proceed through quantum tunnelling events, which are known as quantum phase slips. However, resistive measurements have produced evidence both for and against the occurrence of quantum phase slips. Here, we report evidence for the observation of individual quantum phase-slip events in homogeneous ultranarrow wires at high bias currents. We accomplish this through measurements of the distribution of switching currents for which the width exhibits a rather counter \u2026",

To identify the process dominant in the critical regime we have studied the transport properties of very narrow (9\u201320 nm) MoGe wires fabricated by advanced electron-beam lithography in a wide range of lengths, 1\u201325 \u03bc m. We observed that the wires undergo a superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) that is controlled by cross sectional area of a wire and possibly also by the width-to-thickness ratio. The mean-field critical temperature decreases exponentially with the inverse of the wire cross section. We observed that a qualitatively similar superconductor-insulator transition can be induced by an external magnetic field. Our results are not consistent with any currently known theory of the SIT. Some long superconducting MoGe nanowires can be identified as localized superconductors \u2026",
