            "The effect of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on incident diabetes mellitus is controversial because traditional meta-analyses are hindered by heterogeneity across trials and the absence of trials comparing angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB). We therefore undertook a network meta-analysis, which accounts for both direct and indirect comparisons to assess the effects of antihypertensive agents on incident diabetes.We undertook a systematic review up to Sept 15, 2006, and identified 48 randomised groups of 22 clinical trials with 143\u2008153 participants who did not have diabetes at randomisation and so were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. 17 trials enrolled patients with hypertension, three enrolled high-risk patients, and one enrolled those with heart failure.

Interview data were used to (i) determine the prevalence of self\u2010reported POF overall and by ethnic group, and (ii) assess the association of POF with selected self\u2010reported variables related to health. Cases of POF included only women with no discernible cause for POF. RESULTS: POF was reported by 1.1 \u2026",

            "An atherosclerotic plaque requires a nutrient blood supply, which is predominantly derived from arterial vasa vasorum. A variety of factors (environmental and genetic) contribute to the initiation and growth of atherosclerosis within vessel walls. Chemotactic factors, such as tissue ischemic and hypoxic factors, stimulate the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins, resulting in vessel wall angiogenesis. These developments often precede the formation of the luminal plaque. In this report, we describe the use of contrast-enhanced carotid ultrasound (CECU) imaging for the detection and quantification of intra-plaque neovascularization. The efficacy of CECU was measured against the neovascular density observed within the tissue specimens obtained at the time of carotid endarterectomy surgery. The objective of this study was to provide a histologic correlation between CECU and carotid artery \u2026",

We estimated regression coefficients and odds ratios to determine whether depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score \u226516) predicted increases in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and greater risk of incident diabetes, respectively, over 3 years.RESULTS\u2014Mean baseline HOMA-IR was 1.31 (SD 0.86) and increased 0.05 units per year for all women (P < 0.0001). A total of 97 incident cases of diabetes occurred. Depression was associated with absolute levels of HOMA-IR (P \u2026",
