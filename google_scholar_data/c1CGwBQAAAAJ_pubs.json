Among the possible substitutional dopants at the Mo site, Nb is identified as suitable p-type dopant, while Re is the donor with the lowest activation energy. When dopants are simply adsorbed on a monolayer we find that alkali metals shift the Fermi energy into the MoS 2 conduction band, making the system n type. Finally, the adsorption of charged molecules is considered, mimicking an ionic liquid environment. We find that molecules adsorption can lead to both n-and p-type conductivity, depending on the charge polarity of the adsorbed species.",

When MoS 2 is placed on a defect-free substrate, the oxide plays an insignificant role since the conduction band top and the valence band minimum of MoS 2 are located approximately in the middle of the SiO 2 band gap. However, if Na impurities and O dangling bonds are introduced at the SiO 2 surface, these lead to localized states, which modulate the conductivity of the MoS 2 monolayer from n-to p-type. Our results show that the conductive properties of MoS 2 deposited on SiO 2 are mainly determined by the detailed structure of the MoS 2\/SiO 2 interface, and suggest that doping the substrate can represent a viable strategy for engineering MoS 2-based devices.",

Such nanoribbons, which are nonmagnetic and semiconducting, exhibit a set of weakly interacting edge states whose energy position determines the band gap of the system. We show that, by applying an external transverse electric field, Eext, the nanoribbon band gap can be significantly reduced, leading to a metal\u2013insulator transition beyond a certain critical value. Moreover, the presence of a sufficiently high density of states at the Fermi level in the vicinity of the metal\u2013insulator transition leads to the onset of Stoner ferromagnetism that can be modulated, and even extinguished, by Eext. In the case of bilayer nanoribbons we further show that the band gap can be changed from indirect to direct by applying a transverse field, an effect that \u2026",

Here we introduce the first MoS2-based spin-valves that employ monolayer MoS2 as the nonmagnetic spacer. In contrast with what is expected from the semiconducting band-structure of MoS2, the vertically sandwiched-MoS2 layers exhibit metallic behavior. This originates from their strong hybridization with the Ni and Fe atoms of the Permalloy (Py) electrode. The spin-valve effect is observed up to 240 K, with the highest magnetoresistance (MR) up to 0.73% at low temperatures. The experimental work is accompanied by the first principle electron transport calculations, which reveal an MR of \u223c9% for an ideal Py\/MoS2\/Py junction \u2026",

Here, we show that quantum confinement, together with structural anisotropy, result in an electric-field-tunable Dirac cone in 2D black phosphorus. Using density functional theory calculations, we find that an electric field, E ext, applied normal to a 2D black phosphorus thin film, can reduce the direct band gap of few-layer black phosphorus, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition at a critical field, E c. Increasing E ext beyond E c can induce a Dirac cone in the system, provided the black phosphorus film is sufficiently thin. The electric field strength can tune the position of the Dirac cone and the Dirac-Fermi velocities, the latter being similar in magnitude to that in graphene. We show that the Dirac cone arises from an anisotropic interaction term between the frontier orbitals that are spatially separated due \u2026",
