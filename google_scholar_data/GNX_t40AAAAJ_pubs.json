            "During the last decade, research in indoor localization and navigation has focused on techniques, protocols, and algorithms. The first International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) was held in 2010. Since then, this annual conference showed the progress of research and technology. The variations of evaluation methods are significant in this field: they range from none, to extensive simulations, and real-world experiments under non-lab conditions. We look at the articles published in the proceedings of IPIN by IEEE Xplore from 2010 to 2014, and analyze the development of evaluation methods. We categorized 183 randomly selected papers, in respect to five different aspects. Namely: (1) the underlying system\/technology in use, (2) the evaluation method for the proposed technique, (3) the method of ground truth data gathering, (4) the applied metrics, and (5) whether the authors \u2026",

            "Event detection in wireless sensor networks is a sophisticated method for processing sampled data directly on the sensor nodes, thereby reducing the need for multihop communication with the base station of the network. In contrast to application-agnostic compression or aggregation techniques, event detection pushes application-level knowledge into the network. In-network event detection - especially the distributed form involving multiple sensor nodes - has thus an exceptional potential to increase energy efficiency, thus prolonging the lifetime of the network. In this article, we summarize recently proposed system architectures and algorithms employed for event detection in wireless sensor networks. On the example of the AVS-Extrem platform, we illustrate how energy-efficient event detection can be implemented through a combination of custom hardware design and distributed event detection algorithms.

            "In the current practice, the performance evaluation of RF-based indoor localization solutions is typically realized in non-standardized environments and following ad-hoc procedures, which hampers objective comparison and does not provide clear insight into their intrinsic properties. Many evaluation procedures also neglect important environmental factors like RF interference, diminishing the real-world value of the obtained results. Localization competitions, in which different solutions are evaluated along a set of standardized metrics under unified and representative conditions, can play an important role in mitigating these problems, but their organization is cost and labor intensive. In this paper we report on the design, execution and results from an online localization competition in which several different RF-based indoor localization algorithms have been evaluated with the help of a remotely accessible and \u2026",

However, previous studies on the impact of the human body only conducted static experiments in controlled environments. We confirm known effects and conduct real-world experiments in a typical indoor human tracking scenario using 2.4 GHz time of flight (TOF) range measurements. We analyze the effect on the raw measurements and on the localization results using the localization algorithms Centroid, NLLS, MD-Min-Max, and Geo-n. The experiment design is focused on incident management, where an infrastructure might only be installed in front of the building.
