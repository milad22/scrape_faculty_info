We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5\u201322.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3\u201319.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8\u2013144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.13410.001",

            "Background: Due to the existing controversies in literature about the potential benefits of resistance exercise training (RT) on arterial blood pressure (BP) at rest, and the lack of studies conducted with elderly hypertensive individuals, RT is seldom recommended as a non-pharmacological treatment for arterial hypertension.Objective: To verify the effect of progressive RT on BP, HR, and RPP in elderly women with controlled hypertension.Methods: 20 elderly women (66.8\u00b15.6 years of age), with a sedentary lifestyle, monitored with anti-hypertensive medication, participated in a 12-week RT program (resistance training group-RTG). Twenty-six elderly women (65.3\u00b13.4 years of age) with controlled hypertension did not engage in physical exercise during the study period, and composed the control group.Results: After RT, there was a significant reduction in SBP, MBP, and DP values at rest. No significant drops in DBP and HR values at rest were observed after RT in both groups. The reduction in the RTG was 10.5 mmHg, 6.2 mmHg, and 2218.6 mmHg x bpm for SBP, MBP, and RPP, respectively.Conclusion: Progressive RT reduced SBP, MBP, and RPP values at rest of hypertensive elderly women who were on antihypertensive treatment.(Arq Bras Cardiol 2008; 91 (5): 274-279)",

J Strength Cond Res 25 (5): 1418-1422, 2011-The 1-repetition maximum test (1RM) has been widely used to assess maximal strength. However, to improve accuracy in assessing maximal strength, several sessions of the 1RM test are recommended. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of previous resistance training experience on the reliability of 1RM test. Thirty men were assigned to the following 2 groups according to their previous resistance training experience: no previous resistance training experience (NOEXP) and more than 24 months of resistance training experience (EXP). All subjects performed the 1RM tests in bench press and squat in 4 sessions on distinct days. There was a significant session\u00d7 group effect in bench press (F= 3.09 \u2026",
