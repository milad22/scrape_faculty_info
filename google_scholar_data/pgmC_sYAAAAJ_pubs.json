            "The magnetic reconnection experiment has been constructed to investigate the fundamental physics of magnetic reconnection in a well-controlled laboratory setting. This device creates an environment satisfying the criteria for a magnetohydrodynamic plasma (S\u226b1, \u03c1i\u226aL). The boundary conditions can be controlled externally, and experiments with fully three-dimensional reconnection are now possible. In the initial experiments, the effects of the third vector component of reconnecting fields have been studied. Two distinctively different shapes of neutral sheet current layers, depending on the third component, are identified during driven magnetic reconnection. Without the third component (antiparallel or null\u2013helicity reconnection), a thin double-Y-shaped diffusion region is identified. A neutral sheet current profile is measured accurately to be as narrow as the order of the ion gyroradius. In the presence of an \u2026",

The amplitude probability distribution function of the turbulence is strongly skewed, with density depletion events (or \u201choles\u201d) dominant in the high-density region and density-enhancement events (or \u201cblobs\u201d) dominant in the low-density region. Two-dimensional cross-conditional averaging shows that the blobs are detached, outward-propagating filamentary structures with a clear dipolar potential, while the holes appear to be part of a more extended turbulent structure. A statistical study of the blobs reveals a typical size of ten times the ion sound gyroradius and a typical velocity of one-tenth the sound speed.",

            "A novel multichannel Doppler backscattering system has been designed and tested for application on the DIII-D [J. L. Luxon, Fusion Sci. Technol. 48, 828 (2005)] and National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) [M. Ono et al., Nucl. Fusion 40, 557 (2000)] fusion plasma devices. Doppler backscattering measures localized intermediate wavenumber (k\u22a5\u03c1i\u223c1\u20134,k\u22a5\u223c2\u201315\u2002cm\u22121) density fluctuations and the propagation velocity of turbulent structures. Microwave radiation is launched at a frequency that approaches a cutoff layer in the plasma and at an angle that is oblique to the cutoff layer. Bragg backscattering occurs near the cutoff layer for fluctuations with k\u22a5\u2248\u22122ki, where ki is the incident probe wave vector at the scattering location. The turbulence propagation velocity can be determined from the Doppler shift in the return signal together with knowledge of the scattering wavenumber. Ray tracing simulations \u2026",

            "In 1991 a manuscript describing an instrument for studying magnetized plasmas was published in this journal. The Large Plasma Device (LAPD) was upgraded in 2001 and has become a national user facility for the study of basic plasma physics. The upgrade as well as diagnostics introduced since then has significantly changed the capabilities of the device. All references to the machine still quote the original RSI paper, which at this time is not appropriate. In this work, the properties of the updated LAPD are presented. The strategy of the machine construction, the available diagnostics, the parameters available for experiments, as well as illustrations of several experiments are presented here.",
