The dominant electric-dipole contributions are computed using accurate relativistic many-body techniques of atomic structure. At room temperatures, the resulting uncertainties in the E 1 BBR shifts are large and substantially affect the projected 10\u2212 18 fractional accuracy of the optical-lattice-based clocks. A peculiarity of these clocks is that the characteristic BBR wavelength is comparable to the P 3 fine-structure intervals. To evaluate relevant M 1 and E 2 contributions, a theory of multipolar BBR shifts is developed. The resulting corrections, although presently masked by the uncertainties in the E 1 contribution, are required at the 10\u2212 18 accuracy goal.",

The result is in agreement with the standard model (SM) of elementary particles. This is the most accurate to-date test of the low-energy electroweak sector of the SM. In combination with the results of high-energy collider experiments, we confirm the energy dependence (or \u201crunning\u201d) of the electroweak force over an energy range spanning 4 orders of magnitude (from\u223c 10 MeV to\u223c 100 GeV). Additionally, our result places constraints on a variety of new physics scenarios beyond the SM. In particular, we increase the lower limit on the masses of extra Z bosons predicted by models of grand unification and string theories.",

We find that this transition has a natural linewidth less than 10 mHz in the odd Yb isotopes, caused by hyperfine coupling. The shift in this transition due to the trapping light acting through the lowest order ac polarizability is found to become zero at the magic trap wavelength of about 752 nm. The effects of Rayleigh scattering, multipole polarizabilities, vector polarizability, and hyperfine induced electronic magnetic moments can all be held below 1 mHz (about one part in 10 18). In the case of the hyperpolarizability, however, larger shifts due to nearly resonant terms cannot be ruled out without an accurate measurement of the magic wavelength.",

The dynamic polarizabilities obtained were used to calculate the van der Waals coefficients C 6, C 8, and C 10 of alkaline-earth metal dimers for the interaction of two like atoms in the ground state. The results are compared with other theoretical and experimental data.",
