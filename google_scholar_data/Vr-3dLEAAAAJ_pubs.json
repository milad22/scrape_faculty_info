Even if suppressed by the inverse Planck mass such LV can be tested by current experiments and astrophysical observations. We review the effective field theory approach to describing LV, the issue of naturalness, and many phenomena characteristic of LV. We discuss some of the current observational bounds on LV, focusing mostly on those from high energy astrophysics in the QED sector at order E\/MPlanck. In this context, we present a number of new results which include the explicit computation of rates of the most relevant LV processes, the derivation of a new photon decay constraint, and modification of previous constraints taking proper account of the helicity dependence of the LV parameters implied by effective field theory.",

We find the most general effective Lagrangian consistent with both general coordinate and conformal invariance to leading and next-to-leading orders in the momentum expansion. At the leading order the Lagrangian contains one phenomenological constant and reproduces the results of the Thomas-Fermi theory and superfluid hydrodynamics. At the next-to-leading order there are two additional constants. We express various physical quantities through these constants.",

This is called Lorentz symmetry and relates long wavelengths to short ones: if the symmetry is exact it implies that space-time must look the same at all length scales. Several approaches to quantum gravity, however, suggest that there may be a microscopic structure of space-time that leads to a violation of Lorentz symmetry. This might arise because of the discreteness 1 or non-commutivity 2 of space-time, or through the action of extra dimensions 3. Here we determine a very strong constraint on a type of Lorentz violation that produces a maximum electron speed less than the speed of light. We use the observation of 100-MeV synchrotron radiation from the Crab nebula to improve the previous limit by a factor of 40 million, ruling out this type of Lorentz violation, and thereby providing an important constraint on \u2026",

            "Constraints on possible Lorentz symmetry violation (LV) of order E\/M P l a n c k for electrons and photons in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) are discussed. Using (i) the report of polarized MeV emission from GRB021206 and (ii) the absence of vacuum \u010cerenkov radiation from synchrotron electrons in the Crab Nebula, we improve previous bounds by 10\u2212 10 and 10\u2212 2, respectively. We also show that the LV parameters for positrons and electrons are different, discuss electron helicity decay, and investigate how prior constraints are modified by the relations between LV parameters implied by EFT.",
