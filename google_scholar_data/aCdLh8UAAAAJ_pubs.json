            "DNA-stabilized silver clusters are remarkable for the selection of fluorescence color by the sequence of the stabilizing DNA oligomer. Yet despite a growing number of applications that exploit this property, no large-scale studies have probed origins of cluster color or whether certain colors occur more frequently than others. Here we employ a set of 684 randomly chosen 10-base oligomers to address these questions. Rather than a flat distribution, we find that specific color bands dominate. Cluster size data indicate that these \u201cmagic colors\u201d originate from the existence of magic numbers for DNA-stabilized silver clusters, which differ from those of spheroidal gold clusters stabilized by small-molecule ligands. Elongated cluster structures, enforced by multiple base ligands along the DNA, can account for both magic number sizes and color variation around peak wavelength populations.",

            "DNA-protected silver clusters (Ag N-DNA) possess unique fluorescence properties that depend on the specific DNA template that stabilizes the cluster. They exhibit peak emission wavelengths that range across the visible and near-IR spectrum. This wide color palette, combined with low toxicity, high fluorescence quantum yields of some clusters, low synthesis costs, small cluster sizes and compatibility with DNA are enabling many applications that employ Ag N-DNA. Here we review what is known about the underlying composition and structure of Ag N-DNA, and how these relate to the optical properties of these fascinating, hybrid biomolecule-metal cluster nanomaterials. We place Ag N-DNA in the general context of ligand-stabilized metal clusters and compare their properties to those of other noble metal clusters stabilized by small molecule ligands. The methods used to isolate pure Ag N-DNA for analysis of composition and for studies of solution and single-emitter optical properties are discussed. We give a brief overview of structurally sensitive chiroptical studies, both theoretical and experimental, and review experiments on bringing silver clusters of distinct size and color into nanoscale DNA assemblies. Progress towards using DNA scaffolds to assemble multi-cluster arrays is also reviewed. View Full-Text",

            "The remarkable precision that DNA scaffolds provide for arraying nanoscale optical elements enables optical phenomena that arise from interactions of metal nanoparticles, dye molecules, and quantum dots placed at nanoscale separations. However, control of ensemble optical properties has been limited by the difficulty of achieving uniform particle sizes and shapes. Ligand-stabilized metal clusters offer a route to atomically precise arrays that combine desirable attributes of both metals and molecules. Exploiting the unique advantages of the cluster regime requires techniques to realize controlled nanoscale placement of select cluster structures. Here we show that atomically monodisperse arrays of fluorescent, DNA-stabilized silver clusters can be realized on a prototypical scaffold, a DNA nanotube, with attachment sites separated by <10 nm.

This is accomplished using DNA clamp assemblies that incorporate a 10 atom silver cluster and a 15 or 16 atom silver cluster. Thermally modulated fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) verifies assembly formation. Comparison to Fo\u0308rster theory, using measured spectral overlaps, indicates that the DNA clamps hold clusters within roughly 5 to 6 nm separations, in the range of the finest resolutions achievable on DNA scaffolds. The absence of spectral shifts in dual-cluster FRET pairs, relative to the individual clusters, shows that select few-atom silver clusters of different sizes are sufficiently stable to retain structural integrity within a single nanoscale DNA construct. The spectral stability of the cluster persists in a FRET pair with an organic \u2026",

Application of MG theory to AgN\u2013DNA with 400\u2013850 nm cluster excitation wavelengths indicates that these clusters are characterized by a collective excitation process and suggests effective cluster thicknesses of \u223c2 silver atoms and aspect ratios of 1.5 to 5.

The enormous space of possible DNA sequences for templating clusters has challenged the understanding of how sequence selects cluster properties and has limited the design of applications that employ these clusters. We investigate the genomic role of DNA sequence for fluorescent silver clusters using a data-driven approach. Employing rapid parallel silver cluster synthesis and fluorimetry, we determine the fluorescence spectra of silver cluster products stabilized by 1432 distinct DNA oligomers. By applying pattern recognition algorithms to this large experimental data set, we discover certain DNA base patterns, or \u201cmotifs,\u201d that correlate to silver clusters with similar fluorescence spectra.

The modulation overrides the self-focusing dynamics and results in the formation of regular bottlelike filament distributions. The peak-power thresholds for filamentation, at a particular distance, are relatively accurately estimated by the adaptation of the Marburger formula derived earlier for Gaussian beams.
