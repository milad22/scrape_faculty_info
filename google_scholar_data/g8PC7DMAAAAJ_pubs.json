A Modified Raymond\u2013Roy Classification (MRRC), in which Class IIIa designates contrast within the coil interstices and Class IIIb contrast along the aneurysm wall, was applied retrospectively.Class IIIa aneurysms were more likely to improve to Class I or II than Class IIIb aneurysms (83.34% vs 14.89%, p<0.001) and were also more likely than Class II to improve to Class I (52.78% vs 16.90%, p<0.001).

Currently, there is a dearth of large series examining endovascular treatment of giant IAs only.We reviewed long-term clinical and radiological outcome from a series of 39 consecutive giant IAs treated with endovascular repair in 38 patients at 2 tertiary referral centers. Data were evaluated in 3 ways: on a per-treatment session basis for each aneurysm, at 30 days after each patient's final treatment, and at the last known follow-up examination.Ten (26%) aneurysms were ruptured.

Lumbar fusion surgeries specifically have been scrutinized for rising rates coupled with ill-defined indications for fusion such as stenosis and spondylosis. Administrative databases classify cases with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The ICD-9-CM discharge codes are not designated by surgeons, but rather are assigned by trained hospital medical coders. It is unclear how accurately they capture the surgeon's indication for fusion. The authors first sought to compare the ICD-9-CM code(s) assigned by the medical coder according to the surgeon's indication based on a review of the medical chart, and then to elucidate barriers to data fidelity.A retrospective review was undertaken of all lumbar fusions performed in the \u2026",
