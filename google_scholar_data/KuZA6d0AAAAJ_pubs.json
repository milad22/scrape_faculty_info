            "We report the observation of intense continuous vacuum ultraviolet radiation in the range 60\u2013100 nm from microhollow cathode discharge plasmas in high-pressure He (up to 600 Torr). Two prominent emissions, a narrow, sharply peaked feature in the region of 58\u201365 nm and a broad emission from 65 to 95 nm are attributed to the He\u22172 first- and second-excimer continuum emission, respectively. We also observed several narrow atomic emission lines in the 95\u2013125-nm range that correspond to atomic O, N, and H emission lines. We attribute the presence of these atomic line emissions to near-resonant energy transfer processes involving the He\u22172 excimers and trace concentrations of the impurities O2, N2, and H2 in the discharge feed gas. The processes leading to the atomic line emissions in the present case are similar to the near-resonant energy transfer process observed previously in high-pressure \u2026",

The deposition process is usually carried out with pulsing frequencies in the range 10\u2013350 kHz and duty cycles in the range 50\u201390%. The operating conditions are typically optimized empirically and are critically dependent on the properties of the pulsed plasma in the immediate vicinity of the magnetron. We show how a combination of time-resolved Langmuir probe measurements and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy can be used to characterize the pulsed magnetron plasma and gain insights that can only be obtained conclusively by correlating the results obtained by both techniques.

In order to meet these operational parameters, this paper explores the possibility to use inhomogeneous feed gas processing in a new generation of large-scale ozone generators. We utilize a finite-element model to simulate a discontinuous power induction along the length of the ozone generator tube. The simulation yields the local power density, the local gas temperature gradient, and a relative dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) filamentation packing density. This information, in conjunction with experimental data, provides a sufficiently broad basis of information to infer a correlation between the electrode arrangement and the ozone generation efficiency and overall ozonizer performance.
