            "Engineering the electromagnetic environment of a nanometre-scale light emitter by use of a photonic cavity can significantly enhance its spontaneous emission rate, through cavity quantum electrodynamics in the Purcell regime. This effect can greatly reduce the lasing threshold of the emitter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, providing a low-threshold laser system with small footprint, low power consumption and ultrafast modulation. An ultralow-threshold nanoscale laser has been successfully developed by embedding quantum dots into a photonic crystal cavity (PCC) 6, 7, 8. However, several challenges impede the practical application of this architecture, including the random positions and compositional fluctuations of the dots 7, extreme difficulty in current injection 8, and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits 7, 8. Here we report a new lasing strategy: an atomically thin crystalline semiconductor\u2014that is, a tungsten diselenide \u2026",

Using a subwavelength-patterned quasi-periodic structure, also known as a metasurface, one can build planar optical elements based on the principle of diffraction. Recent demonstrations of high-quality metasurface optical elements are mostly based on high-refractive-index materials. Here, we present a design of low-contrast metasurface-based optical elements. We fabricate and experimentally characterize several silicon nitride-based lenses and vortex beam generators. The fabricated lenses achieved beam spots of less than 1 \u03bcm with numerical apertures as high as \u223c0.75. We observed a transmission efficiency of 90% and focusing efficiency of 40% in the visible regime.

When one mode of the cavity is resonantly driven with coherent light, the system will act as an efficient single photon filter, and the transmitted light will have a strongly sub-Poissonian character. In addition to numerical simulations demonstrating this effect, we present a physical explanation of the underlying mechanism. In particular, we show that the effect results from an interference between the coherent light transmitted through the resonant cavity and the super-Poissonian light generated by photon-induced tunneling. Peculiarly, this effect vanishes in the absence of the cavity loss.",

An essential yet undeveloped ingredient for many photonic applications is the manipulation of its light emission. Here we demonstrate the control of excitonic light emission from monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe 2) in an integrated photonic structure, achieved by transferring one monolayer onto a photonic crystal (PhC) with a cavity. In addition to the observation of an effectively coupled cavity-mode emission, the suspension effects on PhC not only result in a greatly enhanced (~ 60 times) photoluminescence but also strongly pattern the emission in the subwavelength spatial scale, contrasting on and off the holes.
