            "We propose a novel physical realization of a quantum computer. The qubits are electric dipole moments of ultracold diatomic molecules, oriented along or against an external electric field. Individual molecules are held in a 1D trap array, with an electric field gradient allowing spectroscopic addressing of each site. Bits are coupled via the electric dipole-dipole interaction. Using technologies similar to those already demonstrated, this design can plausibly lead to a quantum computer with\u2273 10 4 qubits, which can perform\u223c 10 5 CNOT gates in the anticipated decoherence time of\u223c 5 s.",

It serves as an introduction to the focus issue of New Journal of Physics on Cold and Ultracold Molecules and describes new prospects for fundamental research and technological development. Cold and ultracold molecules may revolutionize physical chemistry and few-body physics, provide techniques for probing new states of quantum matter, allow for precision measurements of both fundamental and applied interest, and enable quantum simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. Ultracold molecules offer promising applications such as new platforms for quantum computing, precise control of molecular dynamics, nanolithography and Bose-enhanced chemistry.

Extensions to the Standard Model, such as weak-scale supersymmetry, posit the existence of new particles and interactions that are asymmetric under time reversal (T) and nearly always predict a small yet potentially measurable electron electric dipole moment (EDM), de, in the range of 10\u221227 to 10\u221230 e\u00b7cm. The EDM is an asymmetric charge distribution along the electron spin () that is also asymmetric under T. Using the polar molecule thorium monoxide, we measured de = (\u20132.1 \u00b1 3.7stat \u00b1 2.5syst) \u00d7 10\u221229e\u00b7cm. This corresponds to an upper limit of |de| < 8.7 \u00d7 10\u221229e\u00b7cm with 90% confidence, an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity relative to the previous best limit.

Laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications 4. For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments that lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole\u2013dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole\u2013dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulations of condensed-matter systems 5 and in quantum computation 6. Also, ultracold molecules could provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics 7, 8 and for tests of fundamental \u2026",
