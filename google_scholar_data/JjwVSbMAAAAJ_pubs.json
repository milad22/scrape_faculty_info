            "Measurements of inclusive charged-hadron transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions are presented for proton-proton collisions at and 2.36 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector during the LHC commissioning in December 2009. For non-single-diffractive interactions, the average charged-hadron transverse momentum is measured to be 0.46\u00b10.01 (stat.)\u00b10.01 (syst.) GeV\/c at 0.9 TeV and 0.50\u00b10.01 (stat.)\u00b10.01 (syst.) GeV\/c at 2.36 TeV, for pseudorapidities between--2.4 and+ 2.4. At these energies, the measured pseudorapidity densities in the central region, dN ch\/d\u03b7|| \u03b7|< 0.5, are 3: 48\u00b10: 02 (stat.)\u00b10.13 (syst.) and 4: 47\u00b10: 04 (stat.)\u00b10.16 (syst.), respectively. The results at 0.9 TeV are in agreement with previous measurements and confirm the expectation of near equal hadron production in and pp collisions. The results at 2.36 TeV represent the highest-energy measurements \u2026",

            "A measurement of the W boson pair production cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV is presented. The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 inverse femtobarns. The W+ W-candidates are selected from events with two charged leptons, electrons or muons, and large missing transverse energy. The measured W+ W-cross section is 60.1+\/-0.9 (stat)+\/-3.2 (exp)+\/-3.1 (theo)+\/-1.6 (lum) pb= 60.1+\/-4.8 pb, consistent with the standard model prediction. The W+ W-cross sections are also measured in two different fiducial phase space regions. The normalized differential cross section is measured as a function of kinematic variables of the final-state charged leptons and compared with several perturbative QCD predictions. Limits on anomalous gauge couplings associated with dimension-six operators are also given in the framework of an effective field theory. The corresponding 95% confidence level intervals are-5.7< c [WWW]\/Lambda^ 2< 5.9 TeV^{-2},-11.4< c [W]\/Lambda^ 2< 5.4 TeV^{-2},-29.2< c [B]\/Lambda^ 2< 23.9 TeV^{-2}, in the HISZ basis.",

Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV\/c and is about 8% at 500 GeV\/c, the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions. Muon charge misassignment ranges from less than 0.01% at 10 GeV\/c to about 1% at 500 GeV\/c.",
