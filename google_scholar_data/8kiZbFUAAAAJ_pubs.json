The analysis accounts for multinucleon mechanisms in neutrino interactions which were found to introduce negligible bias. We describe our first analyses that combine measurements of muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance to estimate four oscillation parameters,| \u0394 m 2|, sin 2 \u03b8 23, sin 2 \u03b8 13, \u03b4 C P, and the mass hierarchy.

The 68% confidence limit on sin 2 (\u03b8 23) is 0.51 4\u2212 0.056+ 0.055 (0.511\u00b10.055), assuming normal (inverted) mass hierarchy.

            "Super-Kamiokande (SK) can search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by detecting neutrinos produced from WIMP annihilations occurring inside the Sun. In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few\u2212 GeV\/c 2\u2212 200\u2212 GeV\/c 2) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun. We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross section \u2026",
