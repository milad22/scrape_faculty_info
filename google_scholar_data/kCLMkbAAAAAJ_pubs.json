The reasons for doing this are recounted, including a review of renormalization-group techniques and their application to scaling phenomena. The renormalization-group equations are derived for Yang-Mills theories. The parameters that enter into the equations are calculated to lowest order and it is shown that these theories are asymptotically free. More specifically the effective coupling constant, which determines the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, vanishes for large spacelike momenta. Fermions are incorporated and the construction of realistic models is discussed. We propose that the strong interactions be mediated by a\" color\" gauge group which commutes with SU (3)\u00d7 SU (3). The problem of symmetry breaking is discussed. It appears likely that this would have a dynamical origin. It is suggested that the gauge \u2026",

At sufficiently high temperatures the plasma of thermal excitations screens all color electric fields and quarks are unconfined. It is believed that the high-temperature theory develops a dynamical mass gap. However in perturbation theory the infrared behavior of magnetic fluctuations is so singular that beyond some order the perturbative expansion breaks down. The topological classification of finite-energy, periodic fields is presented and the classical solutions which minimize the action in each topological sector are examined. These include periodic instantons and magnetic monopoles. At sufficiently high temperature only fields with integral topological charge can contribute to the functional integral.

The models are expanded in powers of 1 N, where N is the number of components of the fermion field. In such an expansion one can explicitly sum to all orders in the coupling constants. It is found that dynamical symmetry breaking occurs in these models for any value of the coupling constant. The resulting theories produce a fermion mass dynamically, in addition to a scalar bound state and, if the broken symmetry is continuous, a Goldstone boson. The resulting theories contain no adjustable parameters. The search for symmetry breaking is performed using functional techniques, the new feature here being that a composite field, say \u03c8 \u03c8, develops a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value.

Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian then leads to a continuum of vacua. The construction and properties of these vacua are analyzed. In non-abelian theories of the strong interactions one finds spontaneous symmetry breaking of axial baryon number without the generation of a Goldstone boson, a mechanism for chiral SU(N) symmetry breaking and a possible source of T violation.",

We find that the dynamical properties of QCD are, to a large extent, a consequence of the structure of the vacuum arising from the tunneling between degenerate, classically stable, vacuums, and that the relevant degrees of freedom can be taken to be the Euclidean path histories that can be used to calculate the tunneling in the semiclassical approximation. This nonperturbative vacuum structure appears well suited to the major features of QCD, ie, the dimensional transmutation that determines the size of the hadrons and the strong-interaction coupling constant, the source of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, and the mechanism responsible for quark confinement.",
