We find that Bi2Se3 grows highly c-axis oriented, with an atomically sharp interface with the GaAs substrate. By optimizing the growth of a very thin GaAs buffer layer before growing the Bi2Se3, we demonstrate the growth of thin films with atomically flat terraces over hundreds of nanometers. Initial time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements herald opportunities for probing coherent spin dynamics at the interface between a candidate topological insulator and a large class of GaAs-based heterostructures.",

            "We review recent work on active colloids or swimmers, such as self-propelled microorganisms, phoretic colloidal particles, and artificial micro-robotic systems, moving in fluid-like environments. These environments can be water-like and Newtonian but can frequently contain macromolecules, flexible polymers, soft cells, or hard particles, which impart complex, nonlinear rheological features to the fluid. While significant progress has been made on understanding how active colloids move and interact in Newtonian fluids, little is known on how active colloids behave in complex and non-Newtonian fluids. An emerging literature is starting to show how fluid rheology can dramatically change the gaits and speeds of individual swimmers. Simultaneously, a moving swimmer induces time dependent, three dimensional fluid flows that can modify the medium (fluid) rheological properties. This two-way, non-linear coupling at \u2026",

            "Run-and-tumble motility is widely used by swimming microorganisms including numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here, we experimentally investigate the run-and-tumble dynamics of the bacterium E. coli in polymeric solutions. We find that even small amounts of polymer in solution can drastically change E. coli dynamics: cells tumble less and their velocity increases, leading to an enhancement in cell translational diffusion and a sharp decline in rotational diffusion. We show that suppression of tumbling is due to fluid viscosity while the enhancement in swimming speed is mainly due to fluid elasticity. Visualization of single fluorescently labeled DNA polymers reveals that the flow generated by individual E. coli is sufficiently strong to stretch polymer molecules and induce elastic stresses in the fluid, which in turn can act on the cell in such a way to enhance its transport. Our results show that the \u2026",

Using particles covering a range of sizes from 0.6 to 39 microns, we probe particle dynamics at both short and long time scales. In all cases, the particles exhibit super-diffusive ballistic behavior at short times before eventually transitioning to diffusive behavior. Surprisingly, we find a regime in which larger particles can diffuse faster than smaller particles: the particle long-time effective diffusivity exhibits a peak in particle size, which is a deviation from classical thermal diffusion. We also find that the active contribution to particle diffusion is controlled by a dimensionless parameter, the P\u00e9clet number. A minimal model qualitatively explains the existence of the effective diffusivity peak and its dependence on bacterial concentration. Our results have broad implications on characterizing \u2026",

            "Mammalian cells frequently migrate through tight spaces during normal embryogenesis, wound healing, diapedesis, or in pathological situations such as metastasis. Nuclear size and shape are important factors in regulating the mechanical properties of cells during their migration through such tight spaces. At the onset of migratory behavior, cells often initiate the expression of vimentin, an intermediate filament protein that polymerizes into networks extending from a juxtanuclear cage to the cell periphery. However, the role of vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) in regulating nuclear shape and mechanics remains unknown. Here, we use wild-type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts to show that VIFs regulate nuclear shape and perinuclear stiffness, cell motility in 3D, and the ability of cells to resist large deformations. These changes increase nuclear rupture and activation of DNA damage repair \u2026",

Physical principles governing interface growth are well understood in passive settings; however, our understanding of interfaces in active systems is still in its infancy. Here, we study the evolution of an active-passive interface using a model active matter system, bacterial swarms. We use ultra-violet light exposure to create compact domains of passive bacteria within Serratia marcescens swarms, thereby creating interfaces separating motile and immotile cells. Post-exposure, the boundary re-shapes and erodes due to self-emergent collective flows. We demonstrate that the active-passive boundary acts as a diffuse interface with mechanical properties set by the flow. Intriguingly, interfacial velocity couples to local swarm speed and interface curvature, raising the possibility that an active \u2026",

After applying a steady pressure-driven flow along a microchannel, the pressure is released and the fluid is allowed to relax and come to rest. Local strains are observed via the time-dependent velocity profiles and are fit to a general viscoelastic model to obtain the fluids' relaxation times. The use of polymeric solutions of various molecular weights allows for the observation of time scales for strains ranging from 0.01 to 10. Results are consistent with data obtained in a macroscopic rheometer and with a viscoelastic constitutive model.",

The signaling pathways and cytoskeletal structures that control cell motility on 2D are often very different from those that control motility in 3D. Previous studies have shown that intermediate filaments can promote actin\u2010driven protrusions at the cell edge, but have little effect on overall motility of cells on flat surfaces. They are however important for cells to maintain resistance to repeated compressive stresses that are expected to occur in vivo.

We find that viscous stresses reduce hexagonal ordering, generate smaller clusters, and significantly decrease the rate of cluster formation, all while holding the system at constant number density.
