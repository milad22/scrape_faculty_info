            "Precise microwave measurements of sample conductivity, dielectric, and magnetic properties are routinely performed with cavity perturbation measurements. These methods require the accurate determination of quality factor and resonant frequency of microwave resonators. Seven different methods to determine the resonant frequency and quality factor from complex transmission coefficient data are discussed and compared to find which is most accurate and precise when tested using identical data. We find that the nonlinear least-squares fit to the phase versus frequency is the most accurate and precise when the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than 65. For noisier data, the nonlinear least-squares fit to a Lorentzian curve is more accurate and precise. The results are general and can be applied to the analysis of many kinds of resonant phenomena.",

The conservation of the valley degree of freedom enables efficient in-and out-coupling of light between the free space and the photonic structure.

We have investigated their superconducting DC and RF properties, their normal state properties, and their microstructures. These films are distinctly different from bulk crystals and post-deposition annealed films. Sharp superconducting transition temperatures can be reproducibly obtained by control of deposition parameters. The Tc can be varied from 75 to 89 K. The optimization of properties other than Tc and the control of film texture occur under conditions different from those for which the highest Tc is obtained. Normal state conductivities are as high as or higher than those of single crystals. Critical current densities reach 6 \u00d7 107 A\/cm2 at 4.2 K. All the above properties are relatively insensitive to compositional variations. The Tc's have a much weaker dependence on the c-axis lattice parameters \u2026",

Recently, a new class of metamaterials has been created to mimic the behavior of media displaying electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Here we introduce a planar EIT metamaterial that creates a very large loss contrast between the dark and radiative resonators by employing a superconducting Nb film in the dark element and a normal-metal Au film in the radiative element. Below the critical temperature of Nb, the resistance contrast opens up a transparency window along with a large enhancement in group delay, enabling a significant slowdown of waves. We further demonstrate precise control of the EIT response through changes in the superfluid density. Such tunable metamaterials may be useful for telecommunication because of their large delay-bandwidth products.",

            "We have measured the surface impedance of Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 (NCCO) thin films and single crystals, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 (YBCO) single crystals, and Nb single crystals. We find that the electrodynamic properties of Nb are in good agreement with s-wave BCS theory. YBCO single crystals show behavior which has been seen only in very high quality materials and which is clearly not consistent with s-wave BCS theory. Both thin films and single crystals of NCCO have been grown, thoroughly characterized, and measured at microwave frequencies. We find an unusual degree of consistency in the results between thin films and crystals of NCCO. We also find a surprisingly good agreement between the temperature dependence of the surface impedance, and single-gap BCS s-wave calculations over the entire temperature range. These results are puzzling in the light of the fact that NCCO is a cuprate \u2026",
