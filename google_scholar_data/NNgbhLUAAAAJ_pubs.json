The stochastic version is studied by dynamic renormalization-group techniques and by mappings to Burgers's equation and to a random directed-polymer problem. The exact dynamic scaling form obtained for a one-dimensional interface is in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations. Predictions are made for more dimensions.",

We present a detailed dynamical renormalization-group analysis of this equation subject to random noise. The noise itself can be the product of another stochastic process and is hence allowed to have correlations in space and\/or time. In dimensions higher than a critical d c weak and strong noise lead to different scaling exponents, while for d< d c any amount of noise is relevant resulting in strong-coupling behavior. In the absence of temporal correlations we find two regimes for d< d c: either the hydrodynamic behavior is determined by white noise and correlations are unimportant, or correlations dominate and the resulting scaling exponents can be obtained exactly. With temporal correlations present, the hydrodynamic behavior is much more complex, as renormalization predicts a complicated dependence of the effective \u2026",

Modified fluctuations of the EM field can also account for the \u201cvan der Waals\u201d interaction between conducting spheres, and have analogs in the fluctuation-induced interactions between inclusions on a membrane.

Our analysis reveals rich temporal structures in the flow of sand: at very short time scales, the flow is dominated by single avalanches. These avalanches overlap at intermediate time scales; their interactions lead to 1\/f noise in the flow. We show that scaling in this region is a consequence of conservation laws and is exhibited in many examples of driven-diffusion equations for transport. At very long time scales, the sandpiles exhibit system-wide discharge events. These events also obey scaling and are found to be anticorrelated. We derive the f 1\/2 mean-field power spectrum for these events and show that a threshold instability of the model, coupled with some stochasticity, is the underlying origin of the long-time anticorrelation.",

The natural coordinate for translocation is the number of monomers on one side of the hole at a given time. Commonly used models that assume Brownian dynamics for this variable predict a mean (unforced) passage time \u03c4 that scales as N 2, even in the presence of an entropic barrier. In particular, however, the time it takes for a free polymer to diffuse a distance of the order of its radius by Rouse dynamics scales with an exponent larger than two, and this should provide a lower bound to the translocation time. To resolve this discrepancy, we perform numerical simulations with Rouse dynamics for both phantom (in space dimensions d= 1 and 2), and self-avoiding (in d= 2) chains. The results indicate that for large N, translocation times scale in the same \u2026",
