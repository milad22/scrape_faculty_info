            "This work explores the mathematical properties of a distribution introduced by Basu & Jones , and applies it to model the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The distribution arises simply from an initial lognormal distribution, requiring that each object in it subsequently undergoes exponential growth but with an exponential distribution of growth lifetimes. This leads to a modified lognormal with a power-law (MLP) distribution, which can in fact be applied to a wide range of fields where distributions are observed to have a lognormal-like body and a power-law tail. We derive important properties of the MLP distribution, like the cumulative distribution, the mean, variance, arbitrary raw moments, and a random number generator. These analytic properties of the distribution can be used to facilitate application to modelling the IMF. We demonstrate how the MLP function provides an excellent fit to the IMF compiled by \u2026",

            "We develop a magnetic ribbon model for molecular cloud filaments. These result from turbulent compression in a molecular cloud in which the background magnetic field sets a preferred direction. We argue that this is a natural model for filaments and is based on the interplay between turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and gravitationally driven ambipolar diffusion, rather than pure gravity and thermal pressure. An analytic model for the formation of magnetic ribbons that is based on numerical simulations is used to derive a lateral width of a magnetic ribbon. This differs from the thickness along the magnetic field direction, which is essentially the Jeans scale. We use our model to calculate a synthetic observed relation between apparent width in projection versus observed column density. The relationship is relatively flat, similar to observations, and unlike the simple expectation based on a Jeans length argument.",

The model is based on weak-field flux freezing in centrally condensed Plummer spheres and spheroids of oblate and prolate shape. For a spheroid of given density contrast, aspect ratio, and inclination, the model estimates the local field strength and direction, and the global field pattern of hourglass shape. Comparisons with a polarization simulation indicate typical angle agreement within 1\u201310. Scalable analytic expressions are given to match observed polarization patterns and to provide inputs to radiative transfer codes for more accurate predictions. The model may apply to polarization observations of dense cores, elongated filamentary clouds, and magnetized circumstellar disks.",

We give an exact expression for the pressure of an ideal nonrelativistic Fermi gas at a finite temperature, therefore allowing for nonzero values of the degeneracy parameter. We review the derivation of surface luminosity using an entropy matching condition and the first-order phase transition between the molecular hydrogen in the outer envelope and the partially ionized hydrogen in the inner region. We also discuss the results of modern simulations of the plasma phase transition, which illustrate the uncertainties in determining its critical temperature. Based on the existing models and with some simple modification, we find the maximum mass for a brown dwarf to be in the range . An analytic formula for the luminosity evolution allows us to estimate the time period of the nonsteady state (i.e., non-main-sequence) nuclear burning for substellar objects. We also calculate the evolution of very low mass stars. We estimate that \u224311% of stars take longer than \u2009yr to reach the main sequence, and \u22435% of stars take longer than \u2009yr.",

We use spatially resolved observations of the nonthermal velocity dispersion from the Green Bank Ammonia survey along with column density maps from SCUBA-2 to estimate the magnetic field strength across seven dense cores located in the L1688 region of Ophiuchus. The CFS model predicts the profile of the relative field fluctuation, which is related to the observable dispersion in the direction of the polarization vectors. Within the context of our model, we find that all of the cores have a transcritical mass-to-flux ratio.",

Although the growth of the power-law can be attributed to gravitational contraction leading to the formation of condensed cores, it is often debated if an observed lognormal shape is a direct consequence of supersonic turbulence alone, or even if it is really observed in molecular clouds. In this paper we run three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations including ambipolar diffusion with different initial conditions to see the effect of strong magnetic fields and non-linear initial velocity perturbations on the evolution of the column density PDFs. Our simulations show that column density PDFs of clouds with supercritical mass-to-flux ratio, with either linear perturbations or \u2026",
