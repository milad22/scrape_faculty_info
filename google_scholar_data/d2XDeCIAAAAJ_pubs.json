            "This paper reports on a new self-report, Likert-scaled instrument that was designed to assess motivation and use of learning strategies by college students. The motivation scales tap into three broad areas: (1) value (intrinsic and extrinsic goal orientation, task value), (2) expectancy (control beliefs about learning, self-efficacy); and (3) affect (test anxiety). The learning strategies section is comprised of nine scales which can be distinguished as cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management strategies. The cognitive strategies scales include (a) rehearsal, (b) elaboration, (c) organization, and (d) critical thinking. Metacognitive strategies are assessed by one large scale that includes planning, monitoring, and regulating strategies. Resource management strategies include (a) managing time and study environment; (b) effort management, (c) peer learning, and (d) help-seeking. Scale reliabilities are robust, and \u2026",

One approach has been to represent solutions by permutations of a list, and\" permutation crossover\" operators have been introduced to preserve legality of offspring. Three permutation crossovers are analyzed to characterize how they sample the o-schema space, and hence what type of problems they may be applicable to. Experiments performed on the Traveling Salesman Problem go some way to support the theoretical analysis.",

Eighteen PAH species were determined by reversed-phase HPLC. Additionally, the suspended particle loading of the air was measured gravimetrically. Dichotomous stacked filter units (DSFUs) were run simultaneously with the high-volumes enabling the collection of particulate matter representative of fine (<2.1 \u03bcm) and coarse sized (2.1\u221210 \u03bcm) fractions. Filters from the DSFUs were analyzed for 19 metal species [by proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE)], ammonium, elemental carbon, and various anions. Metal and PAH concentrations were observed to be broadly in line with concentrations measured at other urban areas throughout \u2026",

We introduced these YACs into Ig-inactivated mice and observed human antibody production which closely resembled that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and repertoire. Diverse Ig gene usage together with somatic hypermutation enables the mice to generate high affinity fully human antibodies to multiple antigens, including human proteins. Our results underscore the importance of the large Ig fragments with multiple V genes for restoration of a normal humoral immune response.

            "A simple and accurate objective test for monitoring lipid oxidation in poultry products is needed. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values of cooked poultry meat were determined by a distillation method and by a modified extraction method. Perchloric acid was used in the extraction method to release TBA reactive substances from the meat. The maximum absorption wavelength of the TBA-malonaldehyde complex was 531 nm. The TBA values for cooked chicken and turkey were highly correlated (r= .91) for both the extraction and distillation methods. Sensory scores of warmed-over flavor in precooked poultry were highly correlated with TBA values in both the distillation (r= .83) and extraction (r= .85) methods. Results indicate that the extraction method is faster, easier to perform, and as accurate as the distillation method for monitoring lipid oxidation in poultry.",

Here we present a structured metamaterial, based on conducting split ring resonators (SRRs), which has an effective index of refraction with a constant spatial gradient. We experimentally confirm the gradient by measuring the deflection of a microwave beam by a planar slab of the composite metamaterial over a range of microwave frequencies. The gradient index metamaterial may prove an advantageous alternative approach to the development of gradient index lenses and similar optics, especially at higher frequencies. In particular, the gradient index metamaterial we propose may be suited for terahertz applications, where the magnetic resonant response of SRRs has recently been demonstrated.",

            "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease occurring preferentially in arterial regions exposed to disturbed flow conditions including oscillatory shear stress (OS). OS exposure induces endothelial expression of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), which in turn may activate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and monocyte adhesion. OS is also known to induce monocyte adhesion by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, raising the possibility that BMP4 may stimulate the inflammatory response by ROS-dependent mechanisms. Here we show that ROS scavengers blocked ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion induced by BMP4 or OS in endothelial cells (ECs). Similar to OS, BMP4 stimulated H2O2 and O2\u2212 production in ECs. Next, we used ECs obtained from p47phox\u2212\/\u2212 mice (MAE-p47\u2212\/\u2212), which do \u2026",
