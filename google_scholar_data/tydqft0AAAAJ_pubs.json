States from pass bands and band edges of the underlying band structure demonstrate single parameter scaling with universal behavior. States from the interior of the band gaps do not have universal behavior and require two parameters to describe their scaling properties. The transition between these two types of behavior occurs in an extremely narrow region of frequencies. When the degree of disorder exceeds a certain critical value the single parameter scaling is restored for an entire band gap.",

The effects due to interplay between resonant interaction of light with quantum well excitons, and light scattering from well-barrier interface, are elucidated. Polariton dispersion equations and reflection spectra in structures with two wells in an elementary supercell of the periodic structure are studied. Several examples of different compound elementary supercells are considered. Special attention is paid to structures with the period or the distance between quantum wells satisfying the resonance Bragg condition. Such structures are characterized by a presence of a larger-than-usual polariton stop band. It is shown that in structures with a complex elementary supercell, the width of such a stop band can be significantly enhanced in comparison to that in simple structures.",
