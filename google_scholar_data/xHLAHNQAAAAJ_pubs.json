            "Microwave transport experiments have been performed in a quasi-two-dimensional resonator with randomly distributed conical scatterers. At high frequencies, the flow shows branching structures similar to those observed in stationary imaging of electron flow. Semiclassical simulations confirm that caustics in the ray dynamics are responsible for these structures. At lower frequencies, large deviations from Rayleigh\u2019s law for the wave height distribution are observed, which can only partially be described by existing multiple-scattering theories. In particular, there are \u201chot spots\u201d with intensities far beyond those expected in a random wave field. The results are analogous to flow patterns observed in the ocean in the presence of spatially varying currents or depth variations in the sea floor, where branches and hot spots lead to an enhanced frequency of freak or rogue wave formation.",

The influence of short-time linear recurrences on correlations and fluctuations at long times is emphasized. We include the contribution to scarring of nonlinear recurrences associated with homoclinic orbits and treat the different scenarios of random and nonrandom long-time recurrences. The importance of the local classical structure around the periodic orbit is emphasized, and it is shown for an optimal choice of test basis in phase space that scars must persist in the semiclassical limit. The crucial role of symmetry is also discussed which, together with the nonlinear recurrences gives a much improved account of the actual strength of scars for given classical orbits and in individual wave- functions. Quantitative measures of scarring are provided and comparisons are made with numerical data.",

We find that in the limit of zero loss, the optimal state is the maximally path-entangled (so-called N00N) state, for small loss, the optimal state gradually deviates from the N00N state, and in the limit of large loss, the optimal state converges to a generalized two-mode coherent state, with a finite total number of photons.

This paper discusses measures of scars and in so doing also tries to clarify the concepts and effects of eigenfunction scarring. We propose a universal scar measure which takes into account an entire periodic orbit and the linearized dynamics in its vicinity. This measure is tuned to pick out those structures which are induced in quantum eigenstates by unstable periodic orbits and their manifolds. It gives enhanced scarring strength as measured by eigenstate overlaps and inverse participation ratios, especially for longer orbits.

            "Refraction of a Longuet\u2010Higgins Gaussian sea by random ocean currents creates persistent local variations (in the form of lumps or streaks) in average energy and wave action distributions. These variations explicitly survive averaging over wavelength and wave propagation direction. The lumps and streaks in average local action mean that the uniform sampling assumed in the venerable Longuet\u2010Higgins theory does not apply. Proper handling of the nonuniform sampling results in greatly increased probability of freak wave formation. The present theory represents a synthesis of Longuet\u2010Higgins Gaussian seas and the refraction model of White and Fornberg, which used a non\u2010Gaussian nonstatistical plane wave incident seaway. Using the linearized equations for deep ocean waves, we obtain quantitative predictions for the increased probability of freak wave formation when the refractive effects are taken into \u2026",
