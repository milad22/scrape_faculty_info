            "Dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking in asymptotically free theories with a slowly running coupling is analyzed. When the confinement scale \u039b is much less than the cutoff M beyond which the theory cannot be used in isolation, the dynamical mass \u03a3 (p) starts from a value\u2248 \u039b for momenta p\u2272 \u039b and falls slowly for a significant range p> \u039b. It then takes on the asymptotic form (ln p) a p 2 where a> 1. In hypercolor theories this behavior generates sufficiently large fermion masses for a higher value of M than naively expected. This in turn could allow for an adequate suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents.",

Analytical and numerical solutions of the homogeneous Dyson-Schwinger equation for the fermion self-energy combined with a computation of the effective potential for the fermion bilinear show that it is energetically preferable for the theory to dynamically generate a mass for fermions. The magnitude of the mass is roughly exponentially suppressed in N from the fundamental dimensionful scale \u03b1\u2261 N e 2 of the gauge coupling constant, but the scale at which the self-mass begins to damp rapidly appears to be of order \u03b1, so that there is no spontaneous breaking of an approximate scale invariance that the underlying theory possesses at momentum small compared to \u03b1. Higher-order 1\/N corrections are analyzed and it is shown that the 1\/N expansion can be used consistently to \u2026",

Particular attention is focused on the renormalization properties of the model and the relevance of the four-fermion operators. In accordance with our previous results, the scale symmetry is explicitly broken and the dilation is not found at either strong or weak coupling. An effective lagrangian simultaneously realizing both spontaneously broken scale and chiral symmetries is constructed.",

The value of the string tension is in very good agreement with recent lattice Monte Carlo evaluations.",
