By using this approach, we also calculate the impact-parameter-dependent GPDs q (x, b \u20d7\u22a5) to visualize the fermion density in the transverse plane (b \u20d7\u22a5). We compare selected results with corresponding quantities in the nonrelativistic limit to reveal relativistic effects. Our results establish the foundation within BLFQ for investigating the form factors and the GPDs for hadronic systems.",

Physics drivers include hadron mass spectroscopy, generalized parton distribution functions, spin structures of the hadrons, inelastic structure functions, hadronization, particle production by strong external time-dependent fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions, and many more. We review selected recent results and future prospects with basis light-front quantization that include fermion-antifermion bound states in QCD, fermion motion in a strong time-dependent external field and a novel non-perturbative renormalization scheme.",

For this work, we adopt light front wave functions (LFWFs) generated by a holographic QCD confining potential and a one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling. We compare our BLFQ results with the limiting case of a single BLFQ basis state description of heavy quarkonia and with other available results. These comparisons provide insights into relativistic effects. Using the same LFWFs generated in the BLFQ approach, we also present the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for selected mesons including those for radially excited mesons such as \u03c8\u2032 and \u03a5\u2032. Our GPD results establish the foundation within BLFQ for further investigating hadronic structure such as probing the \u2026",

We may well be entering an era where theoretical predictions are critical for experimental progress. Cross-fertilization between the fields of relativistic hadronic structure and non-relativistic nuclear structure is readily apparent. Non-perturbative renormalization methods such as similarity renormalization group and Okubo\u2013Lee\u2013Suzuki schemes as well as many-body methods such as coupled cluster, configuration interaction and lattice simulation methods are now employed and advancing in both major areas of physics. New algorithms to apply these approaches on supercomputers are shared among these areas of physics.
