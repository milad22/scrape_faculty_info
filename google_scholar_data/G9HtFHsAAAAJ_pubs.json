            "The kidney is one of the most common sites for cyst in the body (prevalence about 5%). Symptomatic or incidental cyst needs to be characterized further based on Bosniak classification as simple (Bosniak type I & II) or complex (Bosniak type III & IV) cysts with respect to risk of malignancy or other effects on the kidney. The management of simple cysts is entirely for its symptoms or complications (eg, hemorrhage, infection, hydronephrosis, and hypertension). Percutaneous aspiration alone or with sclerotherapy often is the first-line treatment. Surgical decortication generally is reserved for recurrent or very large symptomatic cysts. Laparoscopic surgery is highly efficacious and is associated with high satisfaction rates with minimal morbidity. Retroperitoneal approach is generally preferred, especially in infected or hydatid renal cyst to avoid spillage or contamination of virgin peritoneal cavity. Cyst decortication \u2026",

All patients underwent ESWL every 3 weeks until success or for \u22643 months, whichever was earlier. They were randomly assigned to 2 groups with respect to whether they had received tamsulosin, 0.4 mg\/d. The primary endpoint was the success rate, and the secondary endpoints were clearance time, sessions required for clearance, pain intensity, incidence of steinstrasse, and the need for auxiliary procedures.Of the 139 patients, 51 in group 1 and 65 in group 2 completed the requisite follow-up. The demographic profile of both groups \u2026",

            "Discussion: Patient history and clinical examination were highly sensitive and accurate in predicting a cavernosal tear, and retrograde urethrography was highly sensitive and accurate in detecting urethral injury. Ultrasonography was highly specific but not sensitive for detecting a cavernosal tear. Radiological investigations did not influence patient management in any of the cases. On surgical exploration, 15 patients had cavernosal tears and 4 also had urethral injuries; all injuries were repaired successfully. One patient had a negative surgical exploration and was diagnosed as having a superficial dorsal vein rupture. One patient had a history suggestive of penile fracture but had a normal clinical examination and was kept under observation. At follow up in a mean of 7.5 months, no patient had erectile dysfunction or penile deformity. Conclusion: Further evaluation beyond taking a patient history and performing a clinical examination is not necessary in most cases for managing patients with suspected penile fracture. Retrograde urethrography may be omitted before surgical exploration, even in cases with suspected urethral injury. Early surgical repair is associated with a good outcome with minimal complications.",
