            "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (1027 cm\u22122 s\u22121). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4\u03c0 solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|\u03b7| \u2264 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.",

We confirmed stress-inducible expression of the candidate genes selected by microarray analysis using RNA gel-blot analysis and finally identified a total of 73 genes as stress inducible including 58 novel unreported genes in rice. Among them, 36, 62, 57, and 43 genes were induced by cold, drought, high salinity, and ABA, respectively. We observed a strong association in the expression of stress-responsive genes and found 15 genes that responded to all four treatments.

We evaluated the role of PET imaging in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods: PET images were collected after intravenous injection of 8\u201312 mCi of 18F-FDG in 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PET tumor activity level was assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 compared to normal liver tissue. The PET score was compared with abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan results and between tumors of different grades and differentiation.Results: Of the 20 patients studied, 11 (55%) had positive PET scans (PET score: 3 or 4) while nine (45%) were negative (PET score: 1 or 2). CT scan was positive in 18 patients (90%) and negative in two (10%). PET, however, revealed metastases in three patients that were not seen on CT. On pathological \u2026",
