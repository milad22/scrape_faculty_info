            "WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat \u039b\u2010dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale\u2010invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best\u2010fit parameters are  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large\u2010scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly\u03b1 forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon\/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D\/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB \u2026",

Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \u039bCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted \u201cbase \u039bCDM\u201d in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 \u00b1 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter \u03a9m = 0.308 \u00b1 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 \u00b1 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis.

            "We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission. The full nine-year analysis of the time-ordered data provides updated characterizations and calibrations of the experiment. We also provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new foreground-reduced CMB maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C\u20131 weighting to compute the temperature angular power spectrum \u2026",
