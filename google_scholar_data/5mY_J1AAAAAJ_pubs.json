            "Nanoporous proton-transporting media are critical components in fuel cells and other electrochemical devices, yet general molecular design criteria for new materials with enhanced performance remain obscure. Aqueous lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) comprise a platform for detailed studies of the molecular-level features governing proton transport in monodisperse, water-filled nanopores lined with well-defined chemical functionalities. We report new alkylsulfonic acid LLCs that exhibit H+ conductivities as high as \u03c3 = 380 mS\/cm at 80 \u00b0C, which rival those of more acidic, perfluorinated polymers, thus demonstrating that the acidity of the pore functionality is not the sole determinant of proton transport. Direct experimental comparisons of LLCs with convex and concave nanopores of similar dimensions indicate that H+ conductivities therein sensitively depend on the hydration state of the acid functionalities and the \u2026",

Isothermal frequency spectra acquired prior to nucleation of the ordered BCC phase were time\u2013temperature superposed, and the shift factors were fit using the Williams\u2013Landel\u2013Ferry (WLF) equation.

TMA-7x amphiphiles with x = 3 or 5 exhibit a strong propensity to form normal double gyroid (G) LLC network mesophases over wide surfactant hydration ranges, as compared to homologues with x = 4 or 6. On swelling aqueous TMA-7x LLC mesophases with up to 35 wt % n-decane, we demonstrate that odd-carbon linked surfactants (x = 3 or 5) form G and normal double diamond (D) phases over wide water concentration windows with T = 22\u2212100 \u00b0C.

            "The dynamics of confined water is of fundamental and long-standing interest. In technologically important forms of confinement, such as proton-exchange membranes, electrostatic interactions with the confining matrix and counterions play significant roles on the properties of water. There has been recent interest on the dynamics of water confined to the lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) morphologies of Gemini dicarboxylate surfactants. These systems are exciting because the nature of confinement, for example, size and curvature of channels and surface functionality is dictated by the chemistry of the self-assembling surfactant molecules. Quasielastic neutron scattering experiments have shown an interesting dependence of the water self-diffusion constant, D\u03b1, on the identity (denoted \u03b1) of the counterion: at high hydration, the magnitude of the water self-diffusion constant is in the order DTMA < DNa < DK, where \u2026",

We report the synthesis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of a series of perdeuterated gemini surfactant lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), in which convex, water-filled nanopores of well-defined dimensions are lined with carboxylate functionalities. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements of the translational water dynamics in these dicarboxylate LLC nanopores as functions of the surfactant hydration state and the charge compensating counterion (Na+, K+, NMe4+) reveal that the measured dynamics depend primarily on surfactant hydration, with an unexpected counterion dependence that varies with hydration number. We rationalize these trends in terms of a balance between counterion\u2013water attractions and the nanopore volume excluded by \u2026",

Currently, no analytical method exists for the interpretation of the time-dependent anisotropic scattering from such materials. The framework is applied to interrogate the dynamics of a spherical micelle-forming diblock copolymer melt below the order-disorder transition, wherein finite size grains of a micellar body-centered cubic structure produce anisotropic scattering. A wealth of analytical information is recovered from a simple measurement, including distributions of relaxation times and speeds associated with micelles within grains. The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of this new analytical method, which may be readily adapted for application to \u2026",

A host of empirical studies have suggested that membranes with sub-5 nm pores are ideal for applications in water purification or ion transport. Formed by the aqueous self-assembly of ionic amphiphiles, lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) network (N) phases are candidate membrane materials by virtue of their percolating, sub-3 nm pores. The well-defined pore structures and interfacial chemical functionalities of LLCs also make them an attractive platform for fundamental studies of water-mediated H+ transport and water dynamics in nanoporous materials.
