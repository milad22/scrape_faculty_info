They are considered a valuable criteria for correlation as they occur in similar time intervals from basin to basin. The determined sedimentary breaks occur in the Agenian, Ramblian, Middle Aragonian, Late Aragonian, Late Vallesian, Middle Turolian, Late Turolian, Late Ruscinian-Early Villafranchian, and Villafranchian ages. The larger interior basins (Ebro, Tajo, Duero) show a fairly complete Neogene sedimentary record in which the aboye mentioned sedimentary breaks are usually well recognized. A good correlation may be established from basin to basin. Likewise, there is a fairly good correlation among the Upper Miocene-Pliocene sedimentary record of basins spreading out in Levante and southeastern Spain. However, the correlation is not as c1ear in those basins located within the Iberian and Catalan Coastal Ranges, which usually do not show a similar sedimentary pattern. The comparison between Neogene stratigraphic logs in most of the Spanish continental basins and the pattern of global events from currentIy accepted Cenozoic Cyc1e Charts allows recognition of chronological coincidences, especially with regard to the age of seven major sedimentary ruptures (those developed at about 24.5 Ma, 22 Ma, 16 Ma, 13.5 Ma, 9.5 Ma, 5.5 Ma, 3.3 Ma).

Gravity modeling and seismic attenuation also show the continental nature of the low-velocity zone. Stresses determined from the focal mechanisms of the intermediate-depth earthquakes also agree with the scenario of continental subduction, which is caused by the middle-late Miocene to present-day northwest-southeast convergence of the African and European plates and the continental collision that raised the cordillera.",

The data set is composed of 54 earthquakes with local magnitudes ranging between 2.2 and 4.0 and with epicentral distances to the nearest station smaller than 10 km. A single-scattering process is assumed. Coda-Q values obtained show a clear dependence on frequency according to the relationship Q= Qofn, where n ranges from 0.81 to 0.89. After removing the main site effects and discussing the possible multiple-scattering influence, the lapse-time dependence is interpreted as due to attenuation variations with depth. This result agrees with the variation of coda Q obtained by using different sets of events with increasing hypocentral depth ranges.",

            "The aim of this paper is to examine the mammalian faunas of the Neogene of Spain and of East Africa with a view to understanding the relationships between the Neogene faunas of the two regions. The available data indicates that during the Neogene, faunal similarities between Iberia and East Africa varied greatly, at times the resemblances being relatively great (high number of genera in common), at others the similarities being weak (low number of genera in common). Changes in faunal similarity appear to be related to latitudinal fluctuations in the position of the boundaries of the Proto-Ethiopian and Proto-Palaearctic zoogeographic realms. Periods of greater faunal similarity coincide with a northerly position of the boundary zone, while periods of greater faunal dissimilarity occur when the boundary zone is located in a southerly position, as it is today. We related these changes in the position of the boundary \u2026",

            "The skull and cervical anatomy of the sabre-toothed felid Paramachairodus ogygia (Kaup, 1832) is described in this paper, with special attention paid to its functional morphology. Because of the scarcity of fossil remains, the anatomy of this felid has been very poorly known. However, the recently discovered Miocene carnivore trap of Batallones-1, near Madrid, Spain, has yielded almost complete skeletons of this animal, which is now one of the best known machairodontines. Consequently, the machairodont adaptations of this primitive sabre-toothed felid can be assessed for the first time. Some characters, such as the morphology of the mastoid area, reveal an intermediate state between that of felines and machairodontines, while others, such as the flattened upper canines and verticalized mandibular symphysis, show clear machairodont affinities.",

            "We describe a sample of skulls, mandibles and isolated dentitions of Machairodus aphanistus from the Spanish late Vallesian (late Miocene) site of Batallones-1, near Madrid. This is the first time that the cranial morphology of this species has been seen in detail, and shows that late Vallesian M. aphanistus combined a relatively primitive cranial and mandibular morphology with very specialized upper canines, as flattened as in the later, cranially derived species M. giganteus. Cranio-mandibular adaptations for the canine shear-bite are incipient or non-existent, suggesting that the specialized canines of M. aphanistus were used within the context of a biting mechanism more similar to the canine bite of modern felids. Evolution of more extreme machairodont craniodental features in later members of the homotherin lineage converged with smilodontins but occurred independently of the initial development of derived \u2026",

Our study supports the inference by W. Akersten that the main muscles inserting in the mastoid process in sabretooths were those originating in the atlas, rather than those from the posterior neck, sternum and forelimb. Those inferences were based on the anatomy of the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca (David, 1869) Milne-Edwards, 1870, raising uncertainties about homology, which were founded, as revealed by our results. The mastoid muscle insertions in extant felids differ in important details from those described \u2026",
