            "We build on previous research that explores the external acquisition of competitive capabilities through the embedded ties that firms form in networks and alliances. While information sharing and trust have been theorized to be key features of the interorganizational ties that facilitate the acquisition of competitive capabilities, we argue that these mechanisms provide an incomplete explanation because they do not fully address the partially tacit nature of the knowledge that underlies competitive capabilities. Joint problem\u2010solving arrangements play a prominent role in capability acquisition by promoting the transfer of complex and difficult\u2010to\u2010codify knowledge. Drawing on a set of case studies and a survey of 234 job shop manufacturers we find support for the role of joint problem solving with suppliers in facilitating the acquisition of competitive capabilities.

            "Corporate crises\u2014such as accidents, scandals, and product safety incidents\u2014exacerbate stakeholder demands in such a way that conflict can arise between the interests of shareholders and crisis victims. We show that such conflict arises in the case of accidents, in which (1) the needs of victims are immediate and concrete and the potential corporate liability is great and (2) management can plausibly claim there are mitigating circumstances and factors beyond its control. In the case of accidents, if managers are accommodating to victims, shareholders are likely to suffer. The conflict does not arise in the case of scandals, for neither of those conditions holds. Shareholders benefit when managers are accommodating. This article discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.",

            "Today, it is undeniable that a new enthusiasm exists for green management, not only among managers but among business school students, though this enthusiasm is just starting to be tapped in a more formal way in curriculum, instructional materials, and faculty careers and advancement. Green management matters for many reasons, but fundamentally it matters because people expect managers to use resources wisely and responsibly; protect the environment; minimize the amounts of air, water, energy, minerals, and other materials found in the final goods people consume; recycle and reuse these goods to the extent possible rather than drawing on nature to replenish them; respect nature's calm, tranquility, and beauty; and eliminate toxins that harm people in the workplace and communities.

Based on the literature and a case study we identified two stages in implementing ISO 9000\u2014(1) Installation, which has two dimensions: (a) external coordination and (b) integration; and (2) Usage, which also has two dimensions: (a) in daily practice and (b) as a catalyst for change. The hypotheses were that installation of ISO 9000 is positively related to use of ISO 9000, and use of ISO 9000 is positively related to operating performance. In addition, use of ISO 9000 is positively related to business performance since operating performance is positively related to business performance. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) to test our hypotheses and validated the results by comparing the longitudinal performance of ISO 9000 certified companies with four matched \u2026",

            "\u2003 Given that firms have both business and social goals, an important unanswered question is whether a general dynamic capability breeds competencies in both these areas. In studies of the US retail food industry, we find that while a general dynamic capability affects firms\u2019 competence in supply chain management (a business competency), it does not affect their competence in environmental management (a social competency). Firm mission and the extent to which firms obtain technical assistance are found to affect the acquisition of this latter competency. These findings offer insights into the resource\u2010based view (RBV) of the firm and provide lessons for corporate social responsibility. They reveal more precisely what a general dynamic capability yields and how far its reach extends, suggesting that the factors that drive competitive advantage are not the same as those that drive social responsibility.",

            "Strategy researchers now recognize that distinctive competencies are critically important for sustained competitive advantage. The processes by which such competencies are acquired, however, has only started to be examined. Connections between macro\u2010industrial system level properties and micro\u2010developments in proprietary technology at the firm level need to be made. This paper argues that system\u2010wide properties, such as long\u2010standing elementary and opposing logics in societal forces like governments and markets, and micro\u2010developments, such as the firm's capacity to search for talent, technology, and ideas and to harmonize what it learns internally, can contribute in significant ways to the creation and acquisition of new competencies. Based on the case of pollution prevention in electric generation, it shows how the system\u2010wide properties channel and direct the paths that the acquisition of new \u2026",
