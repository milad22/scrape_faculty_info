            "Only a few years ago, an account of degradation of silicon carbide high-voltage p-i-n diodes was presented at the European Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Compounds (Kloster Banz, Germany, 2000). This report was followed by the intense effort of multiple groups utilizing varied approaches and subsequent progress in both fundamental understanding of this phenomenon and its elimination. The degradation of SiC p-i-n junctions is now well documented to be due to the expansion of Shockley-type stacking faults in the part of the devices reached by the electron-hole plasma. The faults can gradually cover most of the junction area, impeding current flow and, as a result, increasing the on-state resistance. While in most semiconductors stacking faults are electrically inactive, in hexagonal silicon carbide polytypes (4H- and 6H-SiC) they form quantum-well-like electron states observed in luminescence \u2026",

Not only do these two categories of reconstructions have completely different symmetries, but they also have different temperature dependence. It is thus demonstrated that surface reconstructions can be used to identify lattice polarity. Confirmation of the polarity assignment is provided by polarity-selective wet chemical etching of these surfaces.",

The defects which penetrate the GaN films are predominantly perfect edge dislocations with Burgers vectors of the 1\/3<112\u03040> type, lying along the [0001] growth direction. The main sources of threading dislocations are the low angle grain boundaries, formed during coalescence of islands at the initial stages of GaN growth. The grain sizes range from 50 to 500 nm, with in\u2010plane misorientations of less than 3\u00b0. The nature of these threading dislocations suggests that the defect density would not likely decrease appreciably at increasing film thickness, and the suppression of these dislocations could be more difficult.",

The etch pit densities of threading edge and basal plane dislocations changed significantly across the epilayer\/substrate interface. We have observed conversion of basal plane dislocations in the substrates into threading edge dislocations in the epilayers. TEM observation revealed that the threading dislocations in the epilayers are inclined from the c-axis toward the down-step direction. The conversion is interpreted as a result of the image force in the epilayers between flowing growth steps and basal plane dislocations.

From the linear dependence of the inverse bulk MCL on the concentration of Z1\u2215Z2 defects and from the behavior of the deep trap spectra in 4H-SiC p-i-n diodes under forward bias, we conclude that it is Z1\u2215Z2 alone that controls the MCL in this material.",
