The existence of silicene has been achieved recently owing to experiments involving epitaxial growth of silicon as stripes on Ag(001), ribbons on Ag(110), and sheets on Ag(111). The nano-ribbons observed on Ag(110) were found\u2013by both high definition experimental scanning tunneling microscopy images and density functional theory calculations\u2013to consist of an arched honeycomb structure. Angle resolved photo-emission experiments on these silicene nano-ribbons on Ag(110), along the direction of the ribbons, showed a band structure which is analogous to the Dirac cones of graphene. Unlike silicon surfaces, which are highly reactive to oxygen, the silicene nano-ribbons were found to be resistant to oxygen reactivity.On the theoretical \u2026",

For the close-packed faces (111) and (100), the data are consistent with a Debye-Waller formalism involving an effective surface mean square displacement <u2eff>. The quantitative fit with the data is good if anharmonic effects are properly taken into account. This result establishes that a generalized Debye-Waller formalism is, at least as a first approximation, relevant to the helium-surface diffraction. For the rougher surfaces the agreement remains good up to a threshold temperature above which the intensities are always lower than predicted by the model.

In particular, we present an extensive theoretical study of silicene on Ag (111) for which several recent experimental studies have been published. Different silicene structures were obtained only by varying the silicon coverage and\/or its atomic arrangement. All the structures studied show that silicene is buckled, with a Si\u2013Si nearest neighbor distance varying between 2.28 and 2.5 \u00c5. Due to the buckling in the silicene sheet, the apparent (lateral) Si\u2013Si distance can be as low as 1.89 \u00c5.

Over the last decade, the existence and stability of silicene has been the subject of much debate. Theoretical studies were the first to predict a puckered honeycomb structure with electronic properties resembling those of graphene. Though these studies were for free-standing silicene, experimental fabrication of silicene has been achieved so far only through epitaxial growth on crystalline surfaces. Indeed, it was only in 2010 that researchers presented the first experimental evidence of the formation of silicene on Ag(1 1 0) and Ag(1 1 1), which has launched silicene in a similar way to graphene. This very active field has naturally led to the recent growth of silicene on Ir(1 1 1), ZrB2(0 0 0 1) and Au(1 1 0 \u2026",
