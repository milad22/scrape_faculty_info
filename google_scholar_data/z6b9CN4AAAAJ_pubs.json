            "We propose a new mechanism for generating a single transverse spin asymmetry (STSA) in polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the high-energy scattering approximation. In this framework the STSA originates from the q\u2192 q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function followed by a perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even interaction, between the projectile and the target. We show that some aspects of the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks are in qualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing projectile x F and is a nonmonotonic function of the transverse momentum k T. In our framework the STSA peaks at k T near the saturation scale Q s. Our mechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton-nucleus collisions should be much smaller than in proton-proton collisions. We also observe that in our formalism \u2026",

To achieve this, we begin by evaluating the dipole gluon helicity TMD at small x. In the process we obtain an interesting new result: in contrast to the unpolarized dipole gluon TMD case, the operator governing the small-x behavior of the dipole gluon helicity TMD is different from the operator corresponding to the polarized dipole scattering amplitude (used in our previous work to determine the small-x asymptotics of the quark helicity distribution). We then construct and solve novel small-x large-N c evolution equations for the operator related to the dipole gluon helicity TMD.

This asymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target proton combined with a T-odd complex phase. Using the discrete symmetry properties of transverse spinors, we show that the required complex phase originates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective cuts. For simplicity, we work in a model where the proton consists of a valence quark and a scalar diquark. We then show that the phases generated in SIDIS and in DY originate from distinctly different cuts in the amplitudes, which at first appears to obscure the relationship between the single-spin asymmetries in the two processes.
