            "On the eve of the twenty-first century, two new hit shows featuring the Victorian author John Ruskin as a major character played to enthusiastic audiences in New York and San Francisco. It was the year 2000, centenary of the nineteenth-century British writer\u2019s death. But a fever for anniversary trivia alone could not have triggered Ruskin\u2019s sudden theatrical eminence. One of these plays, Greg Murphy\u2019s The Countess, had opened off Broadway in 1999 to become the longest-running new production of that season. The other, Tom Stoppard\u2019s prize-winning The Invention of Love, had previously premiered in 1997 at the National Theatre in London. 1 Even an opera based on Ruskin\u2019s life had debuted in 1995.2 Before this, the last puff of general public awareness about Ruskin had been the cheap and ubiquitous Ruskin Cigar, gone since the 1950s. Now, decades of middle-brow neglect abruptly ended. Suddenly, John Ruskin was a star. But what kind of a star? These entertaining\u2014even excellent\u2014shows still playing regionally all over the United States create for present-day audiences a perverse, ineffectual, repressed effete who exists primarily as a favorable contrast to our currently more liberated selves. The distorted view of Ruskin\u2019s life on stage helps us establish our contemporary identities as superior, an ignominious utility he shares with the rest of Victoriana. But in what other ways, beyond providing fodder for theatergoing self-complacency, is thinking about Ruskin and performance useful",
