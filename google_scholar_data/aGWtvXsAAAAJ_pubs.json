            "Hemolysis occurs in many hematologic and nonhematologic diseases. Extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) has been found to trigger specific pathophysiologies that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with hemolysis, such as acute and chronic vascular disease, inflammation, thrombosis, and renal impairment. Among the molecular characteristics of extracellular Hb, translocation of the molecule into the extravascular space, oxidative and nitric oxide reactions, hemin release, and molecular signaling effects of hemin appear to be the most critical. Limited clinical experience with a plasma-derived haptoglobin (Hp) product in Japan and more recent preclinical animal studies suggest that the natural Hb and the hemin-scavenger proteins Hp and hemopexin have a strong potential to neutralize the adverse physiologic effects of Hb and hemin. This includes conditions that are as diverse as RBC \u2026",

            "Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), formed in vivo from presently unknown reactions, may play a role in atherogenesis. In vitro, transition metals such as iron and copper will facilitate LDL oxidation, but these metals are unlikely to exist in free form in normal body fluids. We have explored the possibility that LDL oxidation may be promoted by heme, a physiologically ubiquitous, hydrophobic, iron-containing compound. Indeed, during several-hour incubation, heme caused extensive oxidative modification of LDL; however, such modification requires only minutes in the presence of small amounts of H2O2 or preformed lipid hydroperoxides within the LDL. Oxidative interactions between heme, LDL, and peroxides lead to degradation of the heme ring and consequent release of heme iron, which further accelerates heme degradation. Coupled (evidently iron-catalyzed) heme degradation and LDL oxidation are both \u2026",

It is hypothesized that monocytes are activated in sickle cell disease and can enhance vaso-occlusion by activating endothelium. To test this hypothesis, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) with sickle and normal mononuclear leukocytes were incubated, and endothelial activation was measured. Endothelial cells incubated with sickle mononuclear leukocytes were more activated than those incubated with normal mononuclear leukocytes, as judged by the increased endothelial expression of adhesion molecules and tissue factor and the adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL).

            "Heme is an essential molecule in aerobic organisms. Heme consists of protoporphyrin IX and a ferrous (Fe2+) iron atom, which has high affinity for oxygen (O2). Hemoglobin, the major oxygen-carrying protein in blood, is the most abundant heme-protein in animals and humans. Hemoglobin consists of four globin subunits (\u03b12\u03b22), with each subunit carrying a heme group. Ferrous (Fe2+) hemoglobin is easily oxidized in circulation to ferric (Fe3+) hemoglobin, which readily releases free hemin. Hemin is hydrophobic and intercalates into cell membranes. Hydrogen peroxide can split the heme ring and release \u201cfree\u201d redox-active iron, which catalytically amplifies the production of reactive oxygen species. These oxidants can oxidize lipids, proteins, and DNA; activate cell-signaling pathways and oxidant-sensitive, proinflammatory transcription factors; alter protein expression; perturb membrane channels; and induce \u2026",

            "Current recommendations of the Adult Treatment Panel and the Children and Adolescents Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program make the concentration of low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C) in serum the basis for the classification and treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Numerous methodologies for the determination of serum LDL-C concentrations, in research and clinical laboratories, have been described. Here, we review the principles, performance, and limitations of major current methodologies for determining LDL-C concentrations. These methods include sequential and density-gradient ultracentrifugation, chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques, and precipitation methods. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of estimating LDL-C concentration by the Friedewald equation, the most commonly used approach in clinical laboratories, are addressed.",
