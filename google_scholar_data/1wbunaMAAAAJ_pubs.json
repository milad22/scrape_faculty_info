            "Scattering of fundamental states of type IIB supergravity and superstring theory is discussed at low orders in perturbation theory in the background of a D-instanton. The integration over fermionic zero-modes in both the low energy supergravity and in the string theory leads to explicit non-perturbative terms in the effective action. These include a single instanton correction to the known tree-level and one-loop R 4 interactions. The \u2018spectrum\u2019of multiply charged D-instantons is deduced by T-duality in nine dimensions from multiply would world-lines of marginally bound D-particles. This, and other clues, lead to a conjectured SL (2, Z) completion of the R 4 terms which suggests that they are not renormalized by perturbative corrections in the zero-instanton sector beyond one-loop. The string theory unit-charged D-instanton gives rise to point-like effects in fixed-angle scattering, raising unresolved issues concerning \u2026",

            "Scalar field theories with appropriate potentials in Minkowski space can have time-dependent classical solutions containing topological defects which correspond to S-branes---ie branes all of whose tangential dimensions are spacelike. It is argued that such S-branes arise in string theory as time-dependent solutions of the worldvolume tachyon field of an unstable D-brane or D-brane-anti-D-brane pair. Using the known coupling of the spacetime RR fields to the worldvolume tachyon it is shown that these S-branes carry a charge, defined as the integral of a RR field strength over a sphere (containing a time as well as spatial dimensions) surrounding the S-brane. This same charge is carried by SD-branes, ie Dirichlet branes arising from open string worldsheet conformal field theories with a Dirichlet boundary condition on the timelike dimension. The corresponding SD-brane boundary state is constructed \u2026",

            "Higher spin gravity is an interesting toy model of stringy geometry. Particularly intriguing is the presence of higher spin gauge transformations that redefine notions of invariance in gravity: the existence of event horizons and singularities in the metric become gauge dependent. In previous work, solutions of spin-3 gravity in the SL (3, R)\u00d7 SL (3, R) Chern-Simons formulation were found, and were proposed to play the role of black holes. However, in the gauge employed there, the spacetime metric describes a traversable wormhole connecting two asymptotic regions, rather than a black hole. In this paper, we show explicitly that under a higher spin gauge transformation these solutions can be transformed to describe black holes with manifestly smooth event horizons, thereby changing the spacetime causal structure. A related aspect is that the Chern-Simons theory admits two distinct AdS 3 vacua with different \u2026",

            "We review recent progress in the construction of black holes in three dimensional higher spin gravity theories. Starting from spin-3 gravity and working our way toward the theory of an infinite tower of higher spins coupled to matter, we show how to harness higher spin gauge invariance to consistently generalize familiar notions of black holes. We review the construction of black holes with conserved higher spin charges and the computation of their partition functions to leading asymptotic order. In view of the anti-de Sitter\/conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence as applied to certain vector-like conformal field theories with extended conformal symmetry, we successfully compare to CFT calculations in a generalized Cardy regime. A brief recollection of pertinent aspects of ordinary gravity is also given.",
