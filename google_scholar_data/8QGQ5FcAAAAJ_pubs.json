            "Wireless sensor networks have many applications, vary in size, and are deployed in a wide variety of areas. They are often deployed in potentially adverse or even hostile environment so that there are concerns on security issues in these networks. Sensor nodes used to form these networks are resource-constrained, which make security applications a challenging problem. Efficient key distribution and management mechanisms are needed besides lightweight ciphers. Many key establishment techniques have been designed to address the tradeoff between limited memory and security, but which scheme is the most effective is still debatable. In this paper, we provide a survey of key management schemes in wireless sensor networks. We notice that no key distribution technique is ideal to all the scenarios where sensor networks are used; therefore the techniques employed must depend upon the requirements of \u2026",

            "Sensor scheduling plays a critical role for energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks. Traditional methods for sensor scheduling use either sensing coverage or network connectivity, but rarely both. In this paper, we deal with a challenging task: without accurate location information, how do we schedule sensor nodes to save energy and meet both constraints of sensing coverage and network connectivity? Our approach utilizes an integrated method that provides statistical sensing coverage and guaranteed network connectivity. We use random scheduling for sensing coverage and then turn on extra sensor nodes, if necessary, for network connectivity. Our method is totally distributed, is able to dynamically adjust sensing coverage with guaranteed network connectivity, and is resilient to time asynchrony. We present analytical results to disclose the relationship among node density, scheduling parameters \u2026",

In particular, black-hole attacks can be easily deployed by an adversary. To defend against this attack, we devise a neighborhood-based method to detect whether a black hole attack exists and a routing recovery protocol to set up a correct path to the true destination. Our methods have the remarkable advantage that the number of encryption\/decryption operations for authentication is much reduced compared to those methods completely relying on cryptography-based authentication, thus saving many system resources (e.g. reducing energy consumption). Through simulation, we evaluate these methods in terms of packet throughput, routing control overhead, detection probability \u2026",

In this paper, we present a nonoverlapping Zone-based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS) for MANETs. Focusing on the protection of MANET routing protocols, we propose the collaboration mechanism of ZBIDS agents and an aggregation algorithm used by ZBIDS gateway nodes. The aggregation algorithm mainly utilizes the probability distribution of the $ Source $ attribute in order to make the final decisions to generate alarms. We demonstrate that, by integrating the security related information from a wider area, the aggregation algorithm can reduce the false alarm ratio and improve the detection ratio. Also, the gateway nodes in ZBIDS can provide more diagnostic information by presenting a global view of \u2026",

In this paper, we study the integration of D2D communication in the framework of SDN and NFV. An inherent challenge in supporting software-defined D2D is the imperfectness of network state information, including channel state information (CSI) and queuing state information, in virtual wireless (QSI) networks. To address this challenge, we formulate the resource sharing problem in this framework as a discrete stochastic optimization problem and develop discrete stochastic approximation algorithms to solve this problem. Such algorithms can reduce the computational complexity \u2026",
