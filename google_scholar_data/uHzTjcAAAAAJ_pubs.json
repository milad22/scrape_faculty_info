            "This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM+ HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic initial conditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM+ HDM models with neutrino mass densities $\\onu= 0.2$ and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM+ HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical programs for both gauges are available at this http URL.",

Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between M\u2022 and stellar velocity dispersion (\u03c3), V-band luminosity (L), and bulge stellar mass (M bulge), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power-law relations for the full galaxy sample are log 10 (M\u2022)= 8.32+ 5.64 log 10 (\u03c3\/200 km s\u20131), log 10 (M\u2022)= 9.23+ 1.11 log 10 (L\/10 11 L\u2609), and log 10 (M\u2022)= 8.46+ 1.05 log 10 (M bulge\/10 11 M\u2609).

We update our earlier fitting form for the mean merger rate per halo as a function of M0, \u03be and z. The overall behaviour of this quantity is unchanged: the rate per unit redshift is nearly independent of z out to z\u223c 15; the dependence on halo mass is weak (\u221dM0.130); and it is nearly a power law in the progenitor mass ratio (\u221d\u03be\u22122).

Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for Msat\/Mhost\u2248 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite \u2026",

We find that the \u2018two-phase\u2019 picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good approximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation \u2013 namely, the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times 1011\u2009M\u2299 is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts. The fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at z = 0 contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, ranging from about 10 per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies to over 80 per cent for M* \u2248 1012\u2009M\u2299 objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation.
