            "We bring out novel dielectric behavior of a spin-chain compound, Ca 3 Co 2 O 6, undergoing N\u00e9el order at (T N=) 24 K. It is found that the virgin curve in the plot of isothermal dielectric constant (\u03b5') versus magnetic-field lies outside the \u2018butterfly-shaped\u2019envelope curve well below T N (eg, 2.6 K), with a signature of a partial arrest of the high-field magnetoelectric (ME) phase in zero-field after travelling through magnetic-field-induced magnetic transitions. This behavior is in contrast to that observed in the isothermal magnetization data. Thus, this work brings out a novel case for \u2018phase-coexistence phenomenon\u2019due to ME coupling. Another strange finding is that there is a weak, but a broad, peak in \u03b5'around 85\u2013115 K well above T N, attributable to incipient spin-chain magnetic ordering. This finding should inspire further work to study ME coupling on artificial assemblies of magnetic chains, also keeping in mind \u2026",

The M (T) and C (T) data establish long-range magnetic ordering at 58 K. The most noteworthy observations are:(i) Distinct anomalies are observed in the dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032) vs T and loss (tan\u03b4) vs T at different temperatures (ie, 12.5, 30, 50, and 58 K); at low temperatures, three magnetic-field-induced transitions are observed in \u03b5\u2032 vs H at 6, 40, and 60 kOe. These transition temperatures and critical magnetic fields track those obtained from magnetization data, establishing the existence of strong magnetoelectric coupling in this compound.(ii) Correspondingly \u2026",

There is no dramatic anisotropy in the high-temperature Curie-Weiss parameter or in the \u03c1 and isothermal magnetization data, though there is a noticeable anisotropy in the magnitude of \u03c1 between two perpendicular orientations. The degree of anisotropy is overall less prominent than in the Gd (which is an S-state ion) and Tb analogs. A point of emphasis is that this compound undergoes long-range magnetic ordering below 8 K as in the case of analogous Gd and Dy compounds. Considering this fact for these compounds with a well-localized f orbital, the spin-glass freezing noted for isomorphous U compounds in the recent literature could be attributed to the role of the f-ligand hybridization, rather than \u2026",

Ce 2 Rh Si 3 exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 7 K. The N\u00e9el temperature decreases gradually with the increase in Co concentration. For x\u2a7e 0.6, no magnetic ordering is observed down to 0.5 K. Interestingly, the x= 0.6 alloy exhibits signatures of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while the Co end member is a Fermi liquid. Thus, a transformation of magnetic-ordering state to nonmagnetism via non-Fermi-liquid state by isoelectronic chemical doping is evident in this solid solution. The heat-capacity data reveal a dominant role of Kondo compensation in the magnetically ordered state.
