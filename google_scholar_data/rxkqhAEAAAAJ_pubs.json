Since then, forensic scientists have focused their efforts in isolating single cells as it can be extremely helpful in solving caseworks where sexual violence was concerned. Laser microdissection is a micromanipulation procedure allowing to cut off precisely the cells of interest from tissue samples or smears by a laser beam fitted with an optical microscope.We have harvested single sperm cells by laser microdissection using a Leica AS LMD (Leica Microsystems, Germany); laser setting, pulse laser intensity and laser alignment as well as recovery of the specimen have been properly fitted to the samples we were dealing with.Different tissue preservation, fixation, histological staining (Papanicolau, Nuclear Fast Red\u2014Picroindigocarmine) methods and \u2026",

METHODS: Twenty-seven PCOS overweight\/obese patients were randomly treated: nine with only diet (D); nine with diet and metformin 1000 mg\/day continuously (D+ M); nine with diet, metformin 500 mg\/day and MYO 4 g\/day plus 400 \u00b5g folic acid daily, continuously (D+ M+ I). Menstrual cycle, Ferriman-Gallwey score, body mass index (BMI), waist hip rate (WHR), body composition by BIA 101 of AKERN SRL, were measured on basal condition and at 3 months. RESULTS: Regularity of menstrual cycle was restored in a significantly number of patients of group D+ M+ I (P< 0.05); Ferriman score was significantly improved by weight loss (P< 0.05). Body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences decreased significantly in all groups without WHR modification; body weight loss significantly depended on adding metformin to diet. Fat mass (FM) kg and% was significantly reduced in groups D and D+ M+ I; fat free mass (FFM) kg was slightly reduced by diet (P< 0.05) and correlated with Ferriman score. CONCLUSION: Body weight loss in obese PCOS patients improves symptoms and body composition; weight loss was dependent on adding metformin to diet; MYO was more effective in restoring regularity of menstrual cycle. Further investigation occurs to confirm metformin and MYO rule on body composition improvement, specially regarding FFM that is likewise \u2026",

            "PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: To evaluate endometrial abnormalities by ultrasonography, hysteroscopy and biopsy in postmenopausal patients treated with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. METHODS: The study was carried out on 113 patients who underwent vaginal ultrasonography, hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. RESULTS: There was a significative relation between ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic features (p< 0.001); 58 polyps were diagnosed at hysteroscopy, although 35 were not found at ultrasonography. A significant relation between ultrasonographic and histological findings was also documented (p< 0.005). A significant relation between histological findings and symptomatology was found (p< 0.05), although pathologies were also present in asymptomatic women. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that long-term tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer patients is associated with a higher incidence of uterine pathology. No significant relation has been documented between duration of treatment and grade of endometrial lesion (p> 0.05). Ultrasonography alone is useful in asymptomatic patients because it selects patients with increased endometrial thickness who should undergo hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy is more accurate in detecting polyps, hyperplastic and neoplastic changes. Asymptomatic tamoxifen treated women should be evaluated as symptomatic patients.",

            "The year following parturition is a critical time for the de novo appearance or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease. The vast majority of postpartum thyroid disease (PPTD) consists of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) and the minority by Graves\u2019 disease and nonautoimmune thyroiditis. PPT has a worldwide prevalence ranging from 1% to 22% and averaging 5% based on a review published in 2012. Several factors confer risk for the development of PPT. Tipically, the clinical course of PPT is characterized by three phases: thyrotoxic, hypothyroid and euthyroid phase. Approximately half of PPT women will have permanent hypothyroidism. The best humoral marker for predictivity, already during the first trimester of gestation, is considered positivity for thyroperoxidase autoantibodies (TPOAb), though only one-third to half of such TPOAb-positive pregnant women will develop PPT. Nutraceuticals (such as selenium) or omega-3-fatty acid supplements seem to have a role in prevention of PPT. In a recent study on pregnant women with stable dietary habits, we found that the fish-consumers had lower rates of positivity (and lower serum levels) of both TPOAb and thyroglobulin Ab (TgAb) compared to meat-eaters. Finally, we remind the reader of other diseases that can be observed in the postpartum period, either autoimmune or nonautoimmune, thyroid or nonthyroid.",
