            "When a drop of a colloidal solution of nanoparticles dries on a surface, it leaves behind coffee-stain-like rings of material with lace-like patterns or clumps of particles in the interior 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These non-uniform mass distributions are manifestations of far-from-equilibrium effects, such as fluid flows 1 and solvent fluctuations during late-stage drying 2. However, recently a strikingly different drying regime promising highly uniform, long-range-ordered nanocrystal monolayers has been found 7, 8. Here we make direct, real-time and real-space observations of nanocrystal self-assembly to reveal the mechanism. We show how the morphology of drop-deposited nanoparticle films is controlled by evaporation kinetics and particle interactions with the liquid\u2013air interface. In the presence of an attractive particle\u2013interface interaction, rapid early-stage evaporation dynamically produces a two-dimensional solution of \u2026",

            "Glasses are rigid, but flow when the temperature is increased. Similarly, granular materials are rigid, but become unjammed and flow if sufficient shear stress is applied. The rigid and flowing phases are strikingly different, yet measurements reveal that the structures of glass and liquid are virtually indistinguishable 1, 2. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a structural signature of the jammed granular state that distinguishes it from its flowing counterpart. Here we find evidence for such a signature, by measuring the contact-force distribution between particles during shearing. Because the forces are sensitive to minute variations in particle position, the distribution of forces can serve as a microscope with which to observe correlations in the positions of nearest neighbours. We find a qualitative change in the force distribution at the onset of jamming. If, as has been proposed 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the jamming and \u2026",

By performing systematic investigations for spatial dimensions d= 3\u201310, in a wide density range and using different preparation protocols, we show that these scalings are indeed universal.

Although similar looking jets are observed on impact in fluid systems 5, 6, 7, they are held together by surface tension. Surprisingly, the granular jet exists in the absence of both surface tension and cohesion, thus fluid jet models are of limited use. Previous work 1, 2 proposed that the jet is created solely by the gravity-driven collapse of a void left by the sphere\u2019s descent through the pack. Here we present experimental evidence that granular jets are instead driven by a more complex process involving the interaction between the sand and interstitial air. Using high-speed X-ray radiography, and high-speed digital video, we observe the formation of the jet both inside and above the bed.

The scaling of the interparticle gaps is known to be constant in all spatial dimensions d\u2014including the physically relevant d= 2 and 3, but the value of the weak force exponent remains the object of debate and confusion.

One might expect to find a simple Debye scaling, but recent results from effective medium theory and the exact solution of mean-field models both predict an anomalous, non-Debye scaling. Being mean-field in nature, however, these solutions are only strictly valid in the limit of infinite spatial dimension, and it is unclear what value they have for finite-dimensional systems. Here, we study packings of soft spheres in dimensions 3 through 7 and find, away from jamming, a universal non-Debye scaling of the DOS that is consistent with the mean-field predictions.
