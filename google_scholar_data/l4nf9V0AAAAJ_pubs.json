            "Solution combustion is an exciting phenomenon, which involves propagation of self-sustained exothermic reactions along an aqueous or sol\u2013gel media. This process allows for the synthesis of a variety of nanoscale materials, including oxides, metals, alloys, and sulfides. This Review focuses on the analysis of new approaches and results in the field of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) obtained during recent years. Thermodynamics and kinetics of reactive solutions used in different chemical routes are considered, and the role of process parameters is discussed, emphasizing the chemical mechanisms that are responsible for rapid self-sustained combustion reactions. The basic principles for controlling the composition, structure, and nanostructure of SCS products, and routes to regulate the size and morphology of the nanoscale materials are also reviewed.

            "An efficient approach that combines short-term (minutes) high-energy dry ball milling and wet grinding to tailor the nano- and microstructure of Ni+Al composite reactive particles is reported. Varying the ball-milling conditions allows control of the volume fraction of two distinct milling-induced microstructures, that is, coarse and nanolaminated. It is found that increasing the fraction of nanolaminated structure present in the composite particles leads to a decrease in their ignition temperature (Tig) from 700 and 500 K. Material with nanolaminated microstructure is also found to be more sensitive to impact ignition when compared with particles with a coarse microstructure. It is shown that kinetic energy (Wcr) thresholds for impact ignition, obtained for an optimized nanolaminated microstructure, is only 100 J. High-speed imaging showed that the impact-induced ignition occurs through formation of hot spots caused by \u2026",
