            "Owing to their high energy efficiency, low pollution, and low noise, fuel cells are widely regarded as 21st century energy-conversion devices for mobile, stationary, and portable power. Through tremendous progress made in the past decade, currently available fuel cell materials appear to be adequate for nearterm markets with highest cost entry points. As a result, industries are currently placing their focus on fuel cell design and engineering for better performance, improved durability, cost reduction, and better cold-start characteristics. This new focus has led to an urgent need for identification, understanding, prediction, control, and optimization of various transport and electrochemical processes that occur on disparate length scales in fuel cells. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current status of fundamental models for fuel cell engineering and indicate where this burgeoning field is heading. By \u2026",

Single- and two-phase regimes of water distribution and transport are classified by a threshold current density corresponding to first appearance of liquid water at the membrane\/cathode interface. When the cell operates above the threshold current density, liquid water appears and a two-phase zone forms within the porous cathode. A two-phase, multicomponent mixture model in conjunction with a finite-volume-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is applied to simulate the cathode operation in this regime. The model is able to handle the situation where a single-phase region co-exists with a two-phase zone in the air cathode.

In addition, at high current densities, excessive amount of water is generated and condenses, filling the pores of electrodes with liquid water, and hence limiting the reactant transport to active catalyst. This phenomenon known as\" flooding\" is an important limiting factor of PEFC performance. In this work, the governing physics of water transport in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic diffusion media is described along with one-dimensional analytical solutions of related transport processes. It is found that liquid water transport across the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is controlled by capillary forces resulting from the gradient in phase saturation. A one-dimensional analytical solution of liquid water transport across the GDL is derived, and liquid saturation in excess of 10% is predicted for a \u2026",

Furthermore, liquid water covers some of the active catalytic surface, rendering them inactive for electrochemical reaction. Traditionally, these two-phase transport processes in the GDL are modeled using so-called unsaturated flow theory (UFT), in which a uniform gas-phase pressure is assumed across the entire porous layer, thereby ignoring the gas-phase flow counter to capillarity-induced liquid motion.

Electrochemical methods are used in conjunction with morphology and wetting property characterization. Surface contact angle of wet-proof-treated GDL as a function of temperature is measured by a novel capillary rise method. It is shown that the contact angle generally decreases with the temperature, and that there is insignificant difference in contact angle on carbon papers treated with different contents of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) ranging from 10 to 40 wt.%. Under all humidification conditions in this study, a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) consisting of 10 wt.% FEP-impregnated GDL shows higher power densities than 30 wt.% FEP-impregnated one.

            "Using an optical\/air polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), the mechanics of liquid water transport, starting from droplet emergence on the gas diffusion layer (GDL) surface, droplet growth and departure, to the two-phase flow in gas channels, is characterized under automotive conditions of 0.82 A\/cm 2, 70 C, and 2 atm. It is observed that water droplets emerge from the GDL surface under oversaturation of water vapor in the gas phase, appear only at preferential locations, and can grow to a size comparable to the channel dimension under the influence of surface adhesion. Liquid film formation on more hydrophilic channel walls and channel clogging are also revealed and analyzed.\u00a9 2004 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.",
