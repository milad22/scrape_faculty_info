So, change was most intense around the turn of the millcnnium; the peculiarities of local socictics affected how change happened and remained reflected in the new provincial cultures that emerged; so too local elites played a central role in these changes, and they enriched and empowered themselves in the process. New settlement patterns, new styles of monumentality and of mundane goods, along with new tastcs and ncw forms of cult. The material conditions of Gallic life changed, and so too did the Gauls\u201d conceptions of the world, as they became Romans (Woolf 1998). Yct there are other ways\u2013othcr than in \u2026",

Currently they are one of the most popular types of battery used in portable electronics because of their high energy density and flexible design. Despite their increasing use at the present time, there is great continued commercial interest in developing new and improved electrode materials for lithium ion batteries that would lead to dramatically higher energy capacity and longer cycle life. Silicon is one of the most promising anode materials because it has the highest known theoretical charge capacity and is the second most abundant element on earth. However, silicon anodes have limited applications because of the huge volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of lithium. This causes cracking and pulverization of the anode, which leads to a loss of electrical contact and eventual fading of capacity \u2026",

For graphene, atomic defects activate the Raman-active centrosymmetric A1g ring-breathing mode known as the D-peak. The relative intensity of this D-peak compared to the G-band peak is the most widely accepted measure of the quality of graphene films. However, no such metric exists for monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS2 or MoS2. Here we intentionally create atomic-scale defects in the hexagonal lattice of pristine WS2 and MoS2 monolayers using plasma treatments and study the evolution of their Raman and photoluminescence spectra. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms plasma-induced creation of atomic-scale point defects in the monolayer sheets. We find that while the Raman spectra of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (at 532 nm \u2026",

            "In this letter, we report a method to fabricate nano-column arrays with different shapes and in-plane orientations by glancing angle deposition. By changing the rate of the rotation during each revolution, we can fabricate nano-columns with circular, elliptical, triangle, rectangular, and pentagon shapes. Depending on the nucleation sites, we can even fabricate flowerlike nano-columns. This method has potential application to produce 3-D lattice. ",

            "Thin film deposition is the most ubiquitous and critical of the processes used to manufacture high-tech devices such as microprocessors, memories, solar cells, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), lasers, solid-state lighting, and photovoltaics. The morphology and microstructure of thin films directly controls their optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, which are often significantly different from bulk material properties. Precise control of morphology and microstructure during thin film growth is paramount to producing the desired film quality for specific applications. To date, many thin film deposition techniques have been employed for manufacturing films, including thermal evaporation, sputter deposition, chemical vapor deposition, laser ablation, and electrochemical deposition.The growth of films using these techniques often occurs under highly nonequilibrium conditions (sometimes referred to as far-from \u2026",
