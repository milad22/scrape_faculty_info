            "The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) is one of three science instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS comprises four separate spectrograph modules covering the wavelength range from 5.3 to 38 \u03bcm with spectral resolutions,   and 600, and it was optimized to take full advantage of the very low background in the space environment. The IRS is performing at or better than the prelaunch predictions. An autonomous target acquisition capability enables the IRS to locate the mid\u2010infrared centroid of a source, providing the information so that the spacecraft can accurately offset that centroid to a selected slit. This feature is particularly useful when taking spectra of sources with poorly known coordinates. An automated data\u2010reduction pipeline has been developed at the Spitzer Science Center.",

Our analysis encompasses spectral energy distributions from the optical to the far\u2010infrared, a morphological sequence based on the IRS spectra, and spectral indices in IRS wave bands representative of continuum emission. By comparing the observed spectra to a grid of accretion disk models, we infer some basic disk properties for our sample of T Tauri stars and find additional evidence for dust settling.",

In one of the objects, DM Tau, the outer disk is truncated at 3 AU; this object is akin to another recently reported in Taurus, CoKu Tau\/4, in that the inner disk region is free of small dust. Unlike CoKu Tau\/4, however, this star is still accreting, so optically thin gas should still remain in the inner disk region. The other object, GM Aur, also accreting, has \u223c0.02 lunar masses of small dust in the inner disk region within \u223c5 AU, consistent with previous reports. However, the IRS spectrum clearly shows that the optically thick outer disk has an inner truncation at a much larger radius than previously suggested, \u223c24 AU.

We have modeled the mid\u2010infrared spectrum (between 8 and 25 \u03bcm) as arising from the inner wall of a disk. Our model disk has an evacuated inner zone of radius \u223c10 AU, with a dusty inner \u201cwall\u201d of half\u2010height \u223c2 AU that is illuminated at normal incidence by the central star. The radiative equilibrium temperature decreases from the inner disk edge outward through the optically thick disk; this temperature gradient is responsible for the emission of the silicate bands at 10 and 20 \u03bcm. The observed spectrum is consistent with being produced by Fe\u2010Mg amorphous glassy olivine and\/or pyroxene, with no evidence of a crystalline component.

Recently, Spitzer has identified a new class of\" pre-transitional disks\" with gaps based on near-infrared photometry and mid-infrared spectra; these objects have an optically thick inner disk separated from an optically thick outer disk by an optically thin disk gap. A near-infrared spectrum provided the first confirmation of a gap in the pre-transitional disk of LkCa 15 by verifying that the near-infrared excess emission in this object was due to an optically thick inner disk. Here, we investigate the difference between the nature of the inner regions of transitional and pre-transitional disks using the same veiling-based technique to extract the near-infrared excess emission above the stellar photosphere. However, in this work we use detailed disk models to fit the excess \u2026",

            "A gravitational-wave (GW) transient was identified in data recorded by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors on 2015 September 14. The event, initially designated G184098 and later given the name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement, preliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event were shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground-and space-based facilities. In this Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the sky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the follow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates Network circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW sky localization coverage, the timeline, and depth of the \u2026",
