            "We report the discovery via radial velocity (RV) measurements of a short-period (P= 2.430420\u00b10.000006 days) companion to the F-type main-sequence star TYC 2930-00872-1. A long-term trend in the RV data also suggests the presence of a tertiary stellar companion with P> 2000 days. High-resolution spectroscopy of the host star yields T eff= 6427\u00b133 K, log g= 4.52\u00b10.14, and [Fe\/H]=\u20130.04\u00b10.05. These parameters, combined with the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) and a parallax, allow us to infer a mass and radius of the host star of M 1= 1.21\u00b10.08 M\u2609 and R 1= 1.09+ 0.15\u20130.13 R\u2609. The minimum mass of the inner companion is below the hydrogen-burning limit; however, the true mass is likely to be substantially higher. We are able to exclude transits of the inner companion with high confidence. Further, the host star spectrum exhibits a clear signature of Ca H and K core emission, indicating \u2026",

            "Over the course of instruction, not only does most introductory physics students\u2019 content knowledge evolve but their attitudes and approaches to problem solving are also likely to evolve.

In this investigation, we examined the views of physics graduate teaching assistants (TAs) enrolled in a semester-long TA professional development course about the instructional benefits of different types of introductory problems based upon the same problem scenario to generate discussion and reflection on their use in different instructional situations. The TAs were asked to list the pros and cons of the problem types, rank them in terms of their instructional benefit and the level of challenge they might produce for their students, and describe when and how often they would use different types of problems in their own classes if they had complete control of teaching the class.

            "The desired learning goals for students in many introductory physics courses often include learning physics concepts and developing expertise in problem-solving and reasoning skills [1\u201321]. The cognitive apprenticeship model can serve as a useful model to support these goals [22]. In this fieldtested framework, learning takes place through a guided process in which students gradually develop self-reliance in solving problems on their own. To facilitate this process, the cognitive apprenticeship model includes three aspects: modeling by instructor or expert to demonstrate the criteria of good performance in problem-solving, coaching and scaffolding to provide immediate feedback as students engage in problem solving, and weaning the support to build autonomous expertlike problem-solving ability [22]. The role of different problem types in the development of expertise: Different problem types, ie, different ways in which a physics problem is posed, can facilitate various aspects of the cognitive apprenticeship model, eg, helping students develop expert-like problem-solving skills and learn physics [23\u201325]. For example, a problem that is broken into parts may be useful in modeling and coaching in expert-like problem-solving approaches in a particular context. Alternatively, a problem type that provides less support can help with the weaning aspect if used after modeling and coaching, and can provide opportunities for students to develop self-reliance in expert-like problem-solving. If students are mostly given problems which are broken into parts, they will not have many opportunities to practice decomposing problems into sub-problems on their \u2026",

In addition, we compared the performance of the introductory physics and astronomy students on the factors which were identified in a factor analysis in the original validation study.
