Lett. 50, 1285 (1983)], based on density-functional theory, as a new means of calculating ground-state properties of realistic metal systems. We derive an expression for the total energy of a metal using the embedding energy from which we obtain several ground-state properties, such as the lattice constant, elastic constants, sublimation energy, and vacancy-formation energy. We obtain the embedding energy and accompanying pair potentials semiempirically for Ni and Pd, and use these to treat several problems: surface energy and relaxation of the (100),(110), and (111) faces; properties of H in bulk metal (H migration, binding of H to vacancies, and lattice expansion in the hydride phase); binding site and adsorption energy of hydrogen on (100),(110), and (111) surfaces; and lastly, fracture of Ni and the effects of hydrogen on the fracture.

The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained.We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory.

In the current work, the ansatz used in the EAM is derived from the local-density functional for the energy. The expression demonstrated here is most appropriate for simple metals and for transition metals with nearly empty or nearly full d bands. An embedding energy is defined as a function of an optimal constant background density, and an equation for that optimal background density is obtained. The cohesive energy is then related to the embedding energy and an electrostatic two-body interaction. It is shown that lowest-order electronic relaxations can be absorbed into the same ansatz.

Such semiconductor core fibers have potential to greatly influence the fields of nonlinear fiber optics, infrared and THz power delivery. More specifically, x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy showed the core to be highly crystalline silicon. The measured propagation losses were 4.3 dB\/m at 2.936 \u03bcm, which likely are caused by either microcracks in the core arising from the large thermal expansion mismatch with the cladding or to SiO_2 precipitates formed from oxygen dissolved in the silicon melt. Suggestions for enhancing the performance of these semiconductor core fibers are provided. Here we show that lengths of an optical fiber containing a highly crystalline semiconducting core can be produced using scalable fiber fabrication techniques.",
