            "The predominant driver of bioanalysis in supporting drug development is the intended use of the data. Ligand-binding assays (LBA) are widely used for the analysis of protein biotherapeutics and target ligands (L) to support pharmacokinetics\/pharmacodynamics (PK\/PD) and safety assessments. For monoclonal antibody drugs (mAb), in particular, which non-covalently bind to L, multiple forms of mAb and L can exist in vivo, including free mAb, free L, and mono- and\/or bivalent complexes of mAb and L. Given the complexity of the dynamic binding equilibrium occurring in the body after dosing and multiple sources of perturbation of the equilibrium during bioanalysis, it is clear that ex vivo quantification of the forms of interest (free, bound, or total mAb and L) may differ from the actual ones in vivo. LBA reagents and assay formats can be designed in principle to measure the total or free forms of mAb and L \u2026",

Freely available medium-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km2 with a standard error of 23,000 km2 \u2026",

It is not known if these therapies also prevent structural damage in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The low sensitivity to change over time of plain radiographic instruments mandates a search for the effects of these therapies on possible biomarkers of cartilage damage. METHODS: We studied 2 populations of patients with AS: (1) patients recruited to a placebo controlled trial of etanercept in AS for 16 weeks; (2) an observational cohort receiving infliximab for disease refractory to conventional therapy.

Accurate quantification of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in biological matrices is essential for assessing its pharmacokinetics and selecting an effective dosing regimen. Therapeutic antibodies may exist in free, partially bound and fully bound forms in the bloodstream.

            "Disease relapse after treatment is common in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ovarian cancer (OVCA), and non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therapies that target tumor-initiating cells (TICs) should improve patient survival by eliminating the cells that can drive tumor recurrence and metastasis. We demonstrate that protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), a highly conserved but catalytically inactive receptor tyrosine kinase in the Wnt signaling pathway, is enriched on TICs in low-passage TNBC, OVCA, and NSCLC patient\u2013derived xenografts (PDXs). To deliver a potent anticancer drug to PTK7-expressing TICs, we generated a targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized anti-PTK7 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable valine-citrulline\u2013based linker, and Aur0101, an auristatin microtubule inhibitor. The PTK7-targeted ADC induced sustained tumor regressions and outperformed standard-of \u2026",
