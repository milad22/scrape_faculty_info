Depression prevalence rates among African American, Hispanic, and White adults were estimated from a population-based national sample and adjusted for potential confounders.Results. African Americans (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93, 1.44) and Hispanics (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.02, 2.04) exhibited elevated rates of major depression relative to Whites. After control for confounders, Hispanics and Whites exhibited similar rates, and African Americans exhibited significantly lower rates than Whites.Conclusions. Major depression and factors associated with depression were more frequent among members of minority groups than among Whites. Elevated depression rates among minority individuals are largely associated with greater health burdens and lack \u2026",

            "The authors assessed all measures of religious commitment (N= 139) reported in research studies published in the American Journal of Psychiatry and Archives of General Psychiatry in 1978 through 1989 (N< 35). For nearly two-thirds of the measures, the studies either made no hypotheses or reported no results concerning the relationship of religious commitment to mental health status. For the great majority of the measures assessed, the studies reported a positive relationship between religious commitment and mental health. Am j Psychiatry 1992; 149: 557-559) here is evidence that religious practices and beliefs are understudied phenomena in clinical fields such as psychiatry (1) and family medicine (2). When religion has been studied, it has usually been assessed by using a static measure-denominational affiliation.

Method: The study was performed at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The subjects were 452 patients 65 years or older who were consecutively admitted for surgical repair of fractured hips. During a baseline year the patients received traditional referral for psychiatric consultation. During the experimental year all the patients at Mount Sinai and the patients on one Northwestern unit were screened for psychiatric consultation. Results: The patients who received psychiatric liaison screening had a higher consultation rate than those who received traditional consultation. The rates of DSM-III disorders in the experimental year were 56% at Mount Sinai and 60% at Northwestern. The mean length of stay was reduced from 20.7 to 1 8.5 days at Mount Sinai and from 15.5 to 13.8 days at Northwestern, resulting in reductions in hospital costs ($647\/day) of $1 66,926 and $97,361, respectively. Fees generated from Medicare service delivery could have paid for the $20,000 psychiatric intervention cost at each site. There was no difference, however, between the two years in the discharge placement of patients. Conclusions: Admission psychiatric liaison screening of elderly patients with hip fractures results in early detection of psychiatric morbidity, better psychiatric care, earlier discharge, and substantial cost savings to the hospital.",

Only those patients whose principal diagnoses were medical or surgical were included. Patients on the medical\/psychiatric units were excluded. The data at Mount Sinai Hospital were collected on the Utilization Information Service hospital discharge abstract form (7). This database includes length of stay, demographic data, and diagnoses, which include an admitting diagnosis, a retrospectively determined principal diagnosis for the condition that resulted in the admission, and up to six secondary diagnoses. The psychiatric diagnoses on the abstracts were made by psychiatric consultants(18%) and primary physicians (82%).Four clinical data reviewers, all professional nurses, confirmed all diagnoses in a 10-15-minute review of each chart; there was 95% agreement between the nurses and the chief rater(based on quarterly samples of 25 charts)(8).
