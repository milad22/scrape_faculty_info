            "The tribological phenomena of adhesion, friction, and wear arise when solid objects make contact. As the size of devices shrinks to micro- and nanoscales, the surface-to-volume ratio increases and the effects of body forces (gravity and inertia) become insignificant compared with those of surface forces (van der Waals, capillary, electrostatic, and chemical bonding). In microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), tribological and static interfacial forces are comparable with forces driving device motion. In this situation, macroscale lubrication and wear mitigation methods, such as the use of bulk fluids and micrometer thick coatings, are ineffective; new nano-engineering approaches must be employed for MEMS devices with moving structures. We review fundamental tribological problems related to micro- and nanoscale mechanical contacts and developments in MEMS lubrications.",

Both coatings have been evaluated in several ways, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle analysis (CAA), work of adhesion by cantilever beam array (CBA) technique and coefficient of static friction using a sidewall testing device. While water and hexadecane contact angles are comparable, the DDMS coated microstructures exhibit higher adhesion than OTS coated ones. Furthermore, coefficient of static friction data indicate that the DDMS films are not as effective at lubrication as the OTS SAMs are, although both exhibit much improvement over chemical oxide.

Multilayer thicknesses ranged from 0.2 nm to 1.0 nm while the multilayer periodic spacing ranged from 3 to 10 nm. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed that the multilayer films had dense microstructures that, in some cases, exhibited significant orientation of their basal planes parallel to the substrate. Film endurance was assessed in sliding contact using thrust washer tests and in rolling contact using thrust bearing tests. Some film microstructures exhibited excellent endurance.

This is attributed to the ability of alcohol to adsorb on the silicon surface and sustain a lubricating layer, which prevents wear of the MEMS surfaces and minimizes friction. In the presence of these vapors, MEMS devices with sliding contacts operated without failure for up to a factor of 1.7 \u00d7 104 longer than in dry N2 gas alone, representing a dramatic improvement in operating life.

Do we want to use this new technology in critical applications such as nuclear weapons? This question drove us to understand the reliability and failure mechanisms of silicon surface-micromachined MEMS. Development of a testing infrastructure was a crucial step to perform reliability experiments on MEMS devices and will be reported here. In addition, reliability test structures have been designed and characterized. Many experiments were performed to investigate failure modes and specifically those in different environments (humidity, temperature, shock, vibration, and storage). A predictive reliability model for wear of rubbing surfaces in microengines was developed. The root causes of failure for operating and non-operating MEMS are discussed. The major failure mechanism for operating MEMS was wear of the polysilicon rubbing surfaces. Reliability design rules for future MEMS devices are established.",

            "The main thrust in any reliability work is identifying failure modes and mechanisms.  This is especially true for the new technology of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS).  The methods are sometimes just as important as the results achieved.  This paper will review some of the methods developed specifically for MEMS.  Our methodology uses statistical characterization and testing of complex MEMS devices to help us identify dominant failure modes.  We strive to determine the root cause of each failure mode and to gain a fundamental understanding of that mechanism.  Test structures designed to be sensitive to a particular failure mechanism are typically used to gain understanding.   The development of predictive models follows from this basic understanding. This paper will focus on the failure mechanism of wear and how our methodology was exercised to provide a predictive model.  The MEMS device \u2026",
