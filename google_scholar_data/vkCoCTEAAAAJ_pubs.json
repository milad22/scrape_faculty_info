            "We perform molecular dynamics simulations of water in the presence of hydrophobic\/hydrophilic walls at T = 300 K and P = 0 GPa. For the hydrophilic walls, we use a hydroxylated silica model introduced in previous simulations [Lee, S. H.; Rossky, P. J. J. Chem. Phys. 1994, 100, 3334. Giovambattista, N.; Rossky, P. J.; Debenedetti, P. G.; Phys. Rev. E 2006, 73, 041604.]. By rescaling the physical partial atomic charges by a parameter 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1, we can continuously transform the hydrophilic walls (hydroxylated silica, k = 1) into hydrophobic apolar surfaces (k = 0). From a physical point of view, k is the normalized magnitude of a surface dipole moment, and thus it quantifies the polarity of the surface. We calculate the contact angle of water for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1. We find that, at least for the present homogeneous, atomically flat, and defect-free surface model, the magnitude of the surface dipole correlates with the contact \u2026",

Furthermore, peripheral charged groups are removed. Thus, the role of a rough surface topography is removed, and results can be productively compared with those previously observed for idealized, atomically smooth hydrophilic and hydrophobic flat surfaces. The results indicate that the protein surface is less hydrophobic than the idealized counterpart.

We study the effects of temperature 220 \u2264 T \u2264 300 K on confined water\u2019s behavior at various pressures \u22120.2 \u2264 P \u2264 0.2 GPa and plate separations 0.5 \u2264 d \u2264 1.6 nm. Combining this with our earlier results on the same system [Giovambattista, N.; Rossky, P. J.; Debenedetti, P. G. Phys. Rev. E: Stat., Nonlinear, Soft Matter Phys. 2006, 73, 041604; Giovambattista, N.; Rossky, P. J.; Debenedetti, P. G. J. Phys. Chem. C, 2007, 11, 1323], where pressure was varied at constant temperature, allows us to compare water\u2019s behavior in nanoscale confinement, upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression, corresponding to paths of interest in protein denaturation. At a fixed temperature, water confined between hydrophobic plates can form vapor, liquid, or \u2026",
