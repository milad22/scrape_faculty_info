This ladder-type system is observed to exhibit electromagnetically induced transparency together with a rapidly varying refractive index.

The polymer solar cells obtained by pairing this polymer with a non-fullerene acceptor demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency of 11.41% with both high open circuit voltage of 0.94 V and high short circuit current density of 17.32 mA cm\u2212 2 benefitted from the complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor, and the high hole transfer efficiency from acceptor to donor although the highest occupied molecular orbital level difference between the donor and acceptor is only 0.11 eV.

The theory is easily generalized to deal with the \u039b configuration, where the ideal arrangement involves two copropagating beams. We discuss different possible regimes, depending on the relative importance of the various broadening mechanisms, and identify ways to optimize the absorption-reduction effect. The theory is compared to the results of a recent experiment (on a ladder-type system), using the Rb D2 line, with generally very good agreement. The maximum absorption reduction observed (64.4%) appears to be mostly limited by the relatively large (\u223c 5 MHz) linewidth of the diode lasers \u2026",

Such structures can be designed as optical analogues of complex parity\u2013time-symmetric potentials with real spectra. However, the beam dynamics can exhibit unique features distinct from conservative systems due to non-trivial wave interference and phase-transition effects. Here, we experimentally realize parity\u2013time-symmetric optics on a chip at the 1,550 nm wavelength in two directly coupled high-Q silica-microtoroid resonators with balanced effective gain and loss. With this composite system, we further implement switchable optical isolation with a non-reciprocal isolation ratio from\u2212 8 dB to+ 8 dB, by breaking time-reversal \u2026",

Reductions in photocurrent noise greater than 60% (\u22124 dB) below the limit set by the vacuum fluctuations of the field are observed in a balanced homodyne detector. A quantitative comparison with theory suggests that the observed noise reductions result from a field that in the absence of avoidable linear attenuation would be squeezed more than tenfold. A degree of squeezing of approximately fivefold is inferred for the actual field emitted through one mirror of the optical parametric oscillator. An explicit demonstration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the electromagnetic field is made from the measurements, which show that the field state produced by the downconversion process is a state of minimum uncertainty.",

            "Two-photon-pumped lasers have been regarded as a promising strategy to achieve frequency up-conversion for situations where the condition of phase matching required by conventional approaches cannot be fulfilled. However, their practical applications have been hindered by the lack of materials holding both efficient two-photon absorption and ease of achieving population inversion. Here, we show that this challenge can be tackled by employing colloidal nanocrystals of perovskite semiconductors. We observe highly efficient two-photon absorption (with a cross section of 2.7 \u00d7 106 GM) in toluene solutions of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that can excite large optical gain (>500 cm\u20131) in thin films. We have succeeded in demonstrating stable two-photon-pumped lasing at a remarkable low threshold by coupling CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with microtubule resonators. Our findings suggest perovskite nanocrystals can be \u2026",
