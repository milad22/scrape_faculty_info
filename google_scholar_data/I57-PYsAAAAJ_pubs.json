            "Single-spin asymmetries for semi-inclusive electroproduction of charged pions in deep-inelastic scattering of positrons are measured for the first time with transverse target polarization. The asymmetry depends on the azimuthal angles of both the pion (\u03d5) and the target spin axis (\u03d5 S) about the virtual-photon direction and relative to the lepton scattering plane. The extracted Fourier component\u27e8 sin\ufeff(\u03d5+ \u03d5 S)\u27e9 U T \u03c0 is a signal of the previously unmeasured quark transversity distribution, in conjunction with the Collins fragmentation function, also unknown. The component\u27e8 sin\ufeff(\u03d5\u2212 \u03d5 S\u27e9 U T \u03c0 arises from a correlation between the transverse polarization of the target nucleon and the intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks, as represented by the previously unmeasured Sivers distribution function. Evidence for both signals is observed, but the Sivers asymmetry may be affected by exclusive vector meson production.",

The moments are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of net charge, and are sensitive to the location of the QCD critical point. We compare the products of the moments, \u03c3 2\/M, S \u03c3, and \u03ba \u03c3 2, with the expectations from Poisson and negative binomial distributions (NBDs). The S \u03c3 values deviate from the Poisson baseline and are close to the NBD baseline, while the \u03ba \u03c3 2 values tend to lie between the two. Within the present uncertainties, our data do not show nonmonotonic behavior as a function of collision energy.

This is also the first measurement of the Z\/\u03b3\u2217 transverse momentum distribution that presents the result at the level of particles entering the detector, minimizing dependence on theoretical models. As any momentum of the Z\/\u03b3\u2217 in the plane transverse to the incoming beams must be balanced by some recoiling system, primarily the result of QCD radiation in the initial state, this variable is an excellent probe of the underlying process. Tests of the predictions of QCD calculations and current event generators show they have varied success in describing the data. Using this measurement as an input to \u2026",

            "The extreme energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic collisions between heavy atomic nuclei produce a state of matter that behaves surprisingly like a fluid, with exceptionally high temperature and low viscosity. Non-central collisions have angular momenta of the order of 1,000 \u045b, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that must be understood to describe the fluid properly. The vortical structure is also of particular interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of strong vorticity. But, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in heavy ion collisions have yet been found. Since vorticity represents a local rotational structure of the fluid, spin\u2013orbit coupling can lead to preferential orientation of particle spins along the direction of rotation. Here we present measurements of an alignment between the global angular momentum of a non-central collision and the spin of emitted particles (in this case the collision occurs between gold nuclei and produces \u039b baryons), revealing that the fluid produced in heavy ion collisions is the most vortical system so far observed.(At high energies, this fluid is a quark\u2013gluon plasma.)
