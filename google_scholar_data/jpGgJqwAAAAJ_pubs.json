            "Recently, Walsh, Carswell and Weymann 1 reported the discovery of two objects (0957+ 56A, B) with identical spectra and separated by 6 arc min. They suggested that a gravitational lens was responsible. The cumulative result of subsequent work on this object (see refs 2\u20139) corroborates this interpretation. The example of 0957+ 56A, B and the data presented here suggest a similar phenomenon is involved in the case of PG1115+ 08.",

Spectral types and color indices of the stars make it possible to infer that grain radii in the clouds exceed typical interstellar medium values and, further, that they increase with optical depth into the cloud. The present observations indicate that the cloud structure is far more extensive than previously realized.",
