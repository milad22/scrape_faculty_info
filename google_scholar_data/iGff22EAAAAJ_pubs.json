We observe spin-wave excitations below 5 meV with a dispersion that can be accounted for by including substantial further-neighbor exchanges that stabilize zigzag magnetic order. The onset of long-range magnetic order below T N= 15.3 K is confirmed via the observation of oscillations in zero-field muon-spin rotation experiments. Combining single-crystal diffraction and density functional calculations we propose a revised crystal structure model with significant departures from the ideal 90 Ir-O-Ir bonds required for dominant Kitaev exchange.",

In fact, the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are in qualitative disagreement: the LDA binds at the experimental lattice constant, whereas the GGA does not. However, the variation in the energy under interlayer shifts, due predominantly to the overlap of \u03c0 orbitals (not dispersion interactions), is nearly identical in these approximations. We combine these results with experimental information on the exfoliation energy to create an improved registry-dependent classical potential for the interlayer interaction in graphitic structures.",

The uniqueness of these configurations gives rise to a set of remarkable properties: o P 12\u2212 FeB 2 is expected to be the first semiconducting metal diboride and o P 10\u2212 FeB 4 is shown to have the potential for phonon-mediated superconductivity with a T c of 15\u201320 K.",

The putative isotope effect on the superconducting critical temperature and the analysis of specific heat data indicate that the superconductivity in FeB 4 is likely phonon mediated, which is rare for Fe-based superconductors. The discovered iron tetraboride is highly incompressible and has the nanoindentation hardness of 62 (5) GPa; thus, it opens a new class of highly desirable materials combining advanced mechanical properties and superconductivity.",
