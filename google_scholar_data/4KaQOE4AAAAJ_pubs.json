            "Manipulating free-space electron wave functions with laser fields can bring about new electron-optical elements for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In particular, a Zernike phase plate would enable high-contrast TEM imaging of soft matter, leading to new opportunities in structural biology and materials science. A Zernike phase plate can be implemented using a tight, intense continuous laser focus that shifts the phase of the electron wave by the ponderomotive potential. Here, we use a near-concentric cavity to focus 7.5 kW of continuous-wave circulating laser power at 1064 nm into a 7 \u00b5m mode waist, achieving a record continuous laser intensity of 40 GW\/cm^2. Such parameters are sufficient to impart a phase shift of 1 rad to a 10 keV electron beam, or 0.16 rad to a 300 keV beam. Our numerical simulations confirm that the standing-wave phase shift profile imprinted on the electron wave by the intra \u2026",

            "This review discusses recent experimental and theoretical analyses of high-harmonic spectroscopy in small molecules, with the aim of characterizing charge migration. We discuss the formulation of molecular high-harmonic spectra followed by methods to extract molecular-target-specific information, both in experiments and ab initio simulations. We present measured and simulated high-harmonic spectra from carbon dioxide and carbonyl sulfide to illustrate the necessity for multidimensional analyses for high-harmonic spectroscopies that include both the spectral amplitude and phase. Leveraging these results, we examine how such multidimensional analyses pave the way for the study of charge migration with high-harmonic spectroscopy and illustrate the beneficial role a static molecular feature can play when probing dynamics. Finally, we briefly expand our scope with an outlook on the critical role of integrating \u2026",
