A variety of measurements (magnetization, Hall effect, magnetic circular dichroism and Raman scattering) suggest that the higher Curie temperature results from an enhanced free hole density. The data also indicate that, in addition to the carrier concentration, the sample thickness limits the maximum attainable Curie temperature in this material, suggesting that the free surface of Ga1\u2212xMnxAs epilayers may be important in determining their physical properties.",

The Raman spectra of as-deposited films show two broad peaks around at 520 and 650 cm\u22121, due to the stretching modes of the V3\u2013O and V2\u2013O bonds, respectively, and a relatively sharp peak at 1027 cm\u22121 due to the V5+\ue605O stretching mode of terminal oxygen atoms. In addition, there is a peak at 932 cm\u22121 that we attribute to the V4+\ue605O bonds. Comparison of the Raman spectra of V2O5 films with different oxygen deficiencies confirms this assignment. This Raman peak due to the stretching mode of the V4+\ue605O bonds develops and shifts toward lower frequencies with increasing lithium concentration. Comparison to results from gasochromic hydrogen insertion indicates that the 932 cm\u22121 Raman peak is not a result of vibrations which involve Li or H atoms.

The PCE was further enhanced when a hole-blocking TiOX layer was inserted in the device structure, resulting in a PCE of \u223c2.6% which is a significantly higher efficiency compared to other previously reported graphene-adopted photovoltaic cells.

            "Microstructural changes of amorphous V2O5 films with lithium intercalation are studied using Raman-scattering measurements. The Raman spectra of as-deposited films show two broad peaks around at 520 and 650 cm\u22121, due to the stretching modes of the V3\u2013O and V2\u2013O bonds, respectively, and a relatively sharp peak at 1027 cm\u22121 due to the V5+=O stretching mode of terminal oxygen atoms. In addition, there is a peak at 932 cm\u22121 that we attribute to the V4+=O bonds. Comparison of the Raman spectra of V2O5 films with different oxygen deficiencies confirms this assignment. This Raman peak due to the stretching mode of the V4+=O bonds develops and shifts toward lower frequencies with increasing lithium concentration. Comparison to results from gasochromic hydrogen insertion indicates that the 932 cm\u22121 Raman peak is not a result of vibrations which involve Li or H atoms. We propose that the V4+=O \u2026",
