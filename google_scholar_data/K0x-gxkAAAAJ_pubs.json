The traces of these quantum monodromy matrices, which will be called as \u201cT-operators,\u201d act in highest weight Virasoro modules.

TheT-operators can be viewed as the continuous field theory versions of the commuting transfermatrices of integrable lattice theory. In particular, we show that for the values  ,n=1,2,3 .... of the Virasoro central charge the eigenvalues of theT-operators satisfy a closed system of functional equations sufficient for determining the spectrum. For the ground-state eigenvalue these functional equations are equivalent to those of the massless Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the minimal conformal field theoryM 2,2n+3; in general \u2026",

We show here how to construct the operators ${\\bf Q}_{\\pm}(\\lambda)$ which act in the highest weight Virasoro module and commute for different values of the parameter \u03bb. These operators appear to be the CFT analogs of the Q - matrix of Baxter [2], in particular they satisfy  Baxter's famous T- Q equation. We also show that under natural assumptions about analytic properties of the operators   as the functions of \u03bb the Baxter's relation allows one to derive the nonlinear integral equations of Destri-de Vega (DDV) [3] for the eigenvalues of the Q-operators. We then use the DDV equation to obtain the  asymptotic expansions of the Q - operators at large \u03bb; it is remarkable that unlike the expansions of the T operators of  [1], the asymptotic series for  Q(\u03bb) contains the \u201cdual\u201d nonlocal Integrals of \u2026",
