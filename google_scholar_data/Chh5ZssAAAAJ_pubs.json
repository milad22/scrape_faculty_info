The measurements use data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb\u22121. The b-jets are identified using either a lifetime-based method, where secondary decay vertices of b-hadrons in jets are reconstructed using information from the tracking detectors, or a muon-based method where the presence of a muon is used to identify semileptonic decays of b-hadrons inside jets. The inclusive b-jet cross-section is measured as a function of transverse momentum in the range 20<p T<400 GeV and rapidity in the range |y|<2.1. The -dijet cross-section is measured as a function of the dijet invariant mass in the range 110<m jj<760 GeV, the azimuthal angle \u2026",

Operating room (OR) managers must consider uncertainty in the duration of surgery and other critical activities, the arrival of unexpected urgent add\u2010on patients, and cancellations on the day of surgery while efficiently managing a variety of human and technical resources. Surgery schedules must be designed to balance competing performance criteria such as patient waiting time as well as idle time and overtime for both the OR team and other personnel.

            "This study is a replication and extension of a study by Castleberry (1990) in which 12 motivational factors related to a sales career were compared across generations. The importance of 12 key motivational factors related to sales positions were rank ordered by 1,390 college students. Respondents represented Gen-X college students from 1990 and Gen-Y students from 2006. The job itself and pay were consistently ranked first and second in both studies for \u201ctoday\u201d and \u201cten years in the future.\u201d Gen-Y students rated \u201chygiene\u201d factors related to job security as significantly more important than did Gen-X students. Conversely, Gen-X students rated \u201csatisfier\u201d factors as significantly more important than did Gen-Y students. Implications for sales managers, recruiters, and educators are provided based on the findings.",

            "It is common for a city to use expensive incentives such as a state-of-the-art stadium or tax exemptions to induce a major professional sport team to relocate to or remain in its area. A city does so because it expects a professional sport team to enhance the local economy. In this article, the authors use an event study approach to evaluate the advisability of this strategy. Their results suggest that major league sports franchises from the four major U.S. team sports (baseball, football, basketball, and hockey) have an adverse impact on local per capita income for U.S. markets in both the short and long run.",

The objective of the share-of-choice problem (a common approach to new product design) is to find the design that maximizes the number of respondents for whom the new product\u2019s utility exceeds a specific hurdle (reservation utility). We present an exact branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the share-of-choice problem. Our empirical results, based on several large commercial data sets and simulated data from a controlled experiment, suggest that the approach is useful for finding provably optimal solutions to realistically sized problems, including cases where partworths contain estimation error.",
