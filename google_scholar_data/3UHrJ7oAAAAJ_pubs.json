            "Spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced by electric current has attracted extensive attention as an efficient method of controlling the magnetization in nanomagnetic structures. SOT-induced magnetization reversal is usually achieved with the aid of an in-plane bias magnetic field. In this paper, we show that by selecting a film stack with weak out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, field-free SOT-induced switching can be achieved in micron sized multilayers. Using direct current, deterministic bipolar magnetization reversal is obtained in Pt\/[Co\/Ni] 2\/Co\/Ta structures. Kerr imaging reveals that the SOT-induced magnetization switching process is completed via the nucleation of reverse domain and propagation of domain wall in the system.",

            "Electrical injection of magnetic domain walls in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy nanowire is crucial for data bit writing in domain wall-based magnetic memory and logic devices. Conventionally, the current pulse required to nucleate a domain wall is approximately~ 10 12 A\/m 2. Here, we demonstrate an energy efficient structure to inject domain walls. Under an applied electric potential, our proposed \u03a0-shaped stripline generates a highly concentrated current distribution. This creates a highly localized magnetic field that quickly initiates the nucleation of a magnetic domain. The formation and motion of the resulting domain walls can then be electrically detected by means of Ta Hall bars across the nanowire. Our measurements show that the \u03a0-shaped stripline can deterministically write a magnetic data bit in 15 ns even with a relatively low current density of 5.34\u00d7 10 11 A\/m 2.

Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) in the structure with broken inversion symmetry induces an asymmetrical DW configuration with respect to the direction of in-plane field. Dynamic behaviors of field-driven DW within the film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is influenced by DW tilt from the iDMI effect and the corners in the T-shaped structure of the DW path. Images from Kerr microscopy reveal that the iDMI effective field contributes to a tilted structure of DW configuration and evolution along its propagation.

The formation of a magnetic monopole is governed by the motion of a magnetic charge carrier via the propagation of domain walls (DWs) in a lattice. To date, most experiments have been on the static visualization of DW propagation in the lattice. In this paper, we report on the low field dynamics of DW in a unit spin-ice structure measured by magnetoresistance changes. Our results show that reversible DW propagation can be initiated within the spin-ice basis. The initial magnetization configuration of the unit structure strongly influences the direction of DW motion in the branches. Single or multiple domain wall nucleation can be induced in the respective branches of the unit spin ice by the direction of the applied field.",

Here, we report on the dynamics of a propagating DW in a bifurcated ferromagnetic wire with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the wire structure induces a tilt angle to the injected DW, which leads to a quasi-selective propagation through the network branch. The DW tilting causes a field interval between DWs to arrive at Hall bars in the individual branches. Micromagnetic results further show that by tailoring the strength of the DMI, the control of DW dynamics in the PMA complex network structures can be achieved.",
