            "The cooling of hot electrons in graphene is the critical process underlying the operation of exciting new graphene-based optoelectronic and plasmonic devices, but the nature of this cooling is controversial. We extract the hot-electron cooling rate near the Fermi level by using graphene as a novel photothermal thermometer that measures the electron temperature (T (t)) as it cools dynamically. We find the photocurrent generated from graphene p\u2013n junctions is well described by the energy dissipation rate CdT\/dt=\u2212 A (T 3\u2212 T l 3), where the heat capacity is C= \u03b1 T and T l is the base lattice temperature. These results are in disagreement with predictions of electron\u2013phonon emission in a disorder-free graphene system, but in excellent quantitative agreement with recent predictions of a disorder-enhanced supercollision cooling mechanism. We find that the supercollision model provides a complete and unified picture of \u2026",

The three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS) data reveal a temperature-independent fast decay, obscuring the quantification of the homogeneous linewidth. The optical gap and Stokes shift are found to have an anomalous behavior with temperature, which is size, capping group, and surrounding polymer matrix independent. Using these results and combining them with simulations, we discuss the role of exciton-phonon coupling, static inhomogeneity, exciton fine structure, and exciton state disorder in the linewidth of the nanocrystal. In particular, our analysis shows that the disorder due to surface imperfections and finite temperature effects, as well as the relaxation within the fine structure, can have significant impact on the steady-state absorption spectrum, 3PEPS data, and dephasing processes.",

Because of the lower symmetry of each constituent monolayer, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows more structural variations in multiple layers than graphene; however, the structure\u2013property relationships in this system remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a strong correlation between the interlayer stacking structures and optical and topological properties in chemically grown h-BN bilayers, measured mainly by using dark-field transmission electron microscopy (DF-TEM) and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) mapping. Our data show that there exist two distinct h-BN bilayer structures with different interlayer symmetries that give rise to a distinct difference in their SHG intensities. In particular, the SHG signal in h-BN bilayers is observed only for \u2026",

Comparison with simultaneously collected transient photocurrent, an independent hot electron thermometer, confirms that the rate-limiting optical and electrical response in graphene are best described by the SC-heat dissipation rate model, H = A(Te3 \u2013 Tl3). Our data further show that the electron cooling rate in substrate-supported graphene is twice as fast as in suspended graphene sheets, consistent with SC model prediction for disorder.",

Systematic measurements of femtosecond pump\u2013probe, two-pulse photon echo, and three-pulse photon echo peak shift over a broad range of excitation intensities and lattice temperature (from 4.4 to 292 K) enable us to quantify the timescales of pure optical dephasing (T2*), along with exciton\u2013exciton and exciton\u2013phonon scattering, environmental effects as well as spectral diffusion. While the exciton dephasing time (T2) increases from 205 fs at room temperature to 320 fs at 70 K, we found that further decrease of the lattice temperature leads to a shortening of the T2 times. This complex temperature dependence was found to arise from an enhanced relaxation of exciton population at lattice temperatures below 80 K. By \u2026",

Strikingly, we find that the transient electronic population in resonantly excited tBLG domains is enhanced many fold, forming a major electronic relaxation bottleneck. Two-photon TA microscopy shows this bottleneck effect originates from a strongly bound, dark exciton state lying \u223c0.37 eV below the 1-photon absorption resonance.
