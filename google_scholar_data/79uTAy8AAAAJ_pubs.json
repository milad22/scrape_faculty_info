            "In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today 1, 2, 3, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy 4, 5. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies 6, 7, 8, 9, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy\u2013galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation 10, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the \u2026",

            "We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive \u2026",

Pressurization from the multiphase ISM prevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if enough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk galaxy.

For the first time, we self\u2010consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling, and star formation, as well as BH growth and associated feedback processes, starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the \u039bCDM cosmology. Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach that we have developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers. Here we examine (1) the predicted global history of BH mass assembly, (2) the evolution of the local black hole\u2013host mass correlations, and (3) the conditions that allow rapid growth of the first quasars, and the properties of their hosts and descendants today. We find a total BH mass density in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH \u2026",

            "We propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which longer periods of rapid black hole accretion are distinguished from observationally inferred lifetimes of quasars owing to gas and dust obscuration. In our picture, quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, fueling starbursts and feeding black hole growth, but are \u201cburied\u201d until feedback from the accretion disperses the obscuring material, creating a window in which the black hole is observable as an optical quasar. Eventually, the activity ceases when the accretion rate drops below that required to maintain quasar luminosities. We study this process by simulating galaxy mergers, using the gas density to infer the bolometric luminosity of the black hole and the gas metallicity and column density to determine the B\u2010band attenuation along arbitrary lines of sight. Defining the visible quasar lifetime as the total time with an observed B\u2010band luminosity greater \u2026",
