            "We used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic properties of MnBi 2 Te 4, a material that was predicted to be an intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological insulator. In striking contrast to earlier literature showing a full gap opening between two surface band manifolds on the (0001) surface, we observed a gapless Dirac surface state with a Dirac point sitting at E B=\u2212 280 meV. Furthermore, our ARPES data revealed the existence of a second Dirac cone sitting closer to the Fermi level. Surprisingly, these surface states remain intact across the AFM transition. The presence of gapless Dirac states in this material may be caused by different ordering at the surface from the bulk or weaker magnetic coupling between the bulk and surface. Whereas the surface Dirac cones seem to be remarkably insensitive to the AFM ordering most likely \u2026",

            "A striking feature of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protected topological insulators (TIs) is that they are characterized by a half integer quantum Hall effect on the boundary when the surface states are gapped by time-reversal breaking perturbations. While TRS-protected TIs have become increasingly under control, magnetic analogs are still a largely unexplored territory with novel rich structures. In particular, magnetic topological insulators can also host a quantized axion term in the presence of lattice symmetries. Since these symmetries are naturally broken on the boundary, the surface states can develop a gap without external manipulation. In this paper, we combine theoretical analysis, density-functional calculations and experimental evidence to reveal intrinsic axion insulating behavior in MnBi 6 Te 10. The quantized axion term arises from the simplest possible mechanism in the antiferromagnetic regime where \u2026",

Here, we report the successful synthesis of single crystals of EuCd 2 As 2 that order ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically depending on the level of band filling, thus allowing for the use of magnetism to tune the topological properties within the same host. We explored their physical properties via magnetization, electrical transport, heat capacity, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and conclude that EuCd 2 As 2 is an excellent, tunable system for exploring the interplay of magnetic ordering and topology.",

            "Time reversal symmetric (TRS) invariant topological insulators (TIs) fullfil a paradigmatic role in the field of topological materials, standing at the origin of its development. Apart from TRS protected'strong'TIs, it was realized early on that more confounding weak topological insulators (WTI) exist. WTIs depend on translational symmetry and exhibit topological surface states only in certain directions making it significantly more difficult to match the experimental success of strong TIs. We here report on the discovery of a WTI state in RhBi2 that belongs to the optimal space group P1, which is the only space group where symmetry indicated eigenvalues enumerate all possible invariants due to absence of additional constraining crystalline symmetries. Our ARPES, DFT calculations, and effective model reveal topological surface states with saddle points that are located in the vicinity of a Dirac point resulting in a van Hove singularity (VHS) along the (100) direction close to the Fermi energy. Due to the combination of exotic features, this material offers great potential as a material platform for novel quantum effects.",

This design is based on in situ helium reliquification and utilizes pulse tube cryocooler. The pulse tube can be removed for baking without breaking Ultra High Vacuum (UHV). This design also allows the use of non-UHV heater that can be replaced without the need to vent the system. The cold finger has minimal vibration, operates over a temperature range of 1.7 K\u2013400 K, and has no measurable residual magnetization. In continuous mode, it can maintain a sample temperature of 2.6 K, while in single shot mode (by pumping on liquid helium), it can reach temperatures down to 1.8 K for a period of several hours.",
