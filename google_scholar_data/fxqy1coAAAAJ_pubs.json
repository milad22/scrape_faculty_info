            "Echo state network (ESN) is a fast recurrent neural network with remarkable generalization performance for intelligent diagnosis of machinery faults. When dealing with high-dimensional signals mixed with much noise, however, the performance of a deep ESN is still highly affected by the random selection of input weights and reservoir weights, resulting in the optimal design of the deep ESN architecture, which is an open issue. For this reason, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm featuring a competitive swarm optimizer combined with a local search is proposed in this article. An indirect encoding method is designed based on the network characteristics of ESN to make the evolutionary process computationally economical. A layerwise optimization strategy is subsequently introduced for evolving deep ESNs. The results of two experimental cases show that the proposed approach has promising performance in identifying \u2026",

            "This paper studies the prize-collecting vehicle routing problem (PCVRP), which is a new variant of the vehicle routing problem. In the PCVRP, besides the vehicle assignment and visiting sequencing, customer selection also must be determined because the available vehicles are insufficient to visit all the customers. Two types of PCVRP are often encountered in the real world, namely the PCVRP in which the number of vehicles is predetermined (PCVRP-P) and that in which the number of vehicles is not predetermined (PCVRP-NP). In general, multiple optimization objectives are required to be considered in both the PCVRP-P and PCVRP-NP. Unlike the commonly used weighted-sum method, a Pareto-based evolutionary algorithm featuring a genetic algorithm combined with a local search strategy (denoted as HGLS) is proposed for solving the multi-objective PCVRP-P.

            "Manufacturing quality prediction model, as an effective measure to monitor the quality in advance, has been developed using various data-driven techniques. However, multi-parameter in multi-stage of the modern manufacturing industry brings about the curse of dimensionality, leading to the difficulties for feature extraction, learning and quality modeling. To address this issue, three dimension reduction techniques are investigated in this paper, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), locally linear embedding (LLE), and isometric mapping (Isomap). Specifically, the PCA is a linear dimension reduction technique, the LLE is a nonlinear reduction technique with local perspective, and the Isomap is a nonlinear reduction technique from global perspective.

            "Fault diagnosis is of importance to guarantee the printing quality and to avoid unexpected downtime for 3-D printers. In this paper, a sparse echo autoencoder network (SEAEN) is proposed for the fault diagnosis of delta 3-D printers using attitude data. Considering the practicality and economy of the fault diagnosis, the attitude data, including three-axial angular velocity signals, three-axial vibratory acceleration ones, and three-axial magnetic field intensity ones, are collected by installing a low-cost attitude sensor on the moving platform of the delta 3-D printer. However, the low-cost sensor will increase the chaos of the attitude data. To make up this deficiency, the SEAEN approach featuring a sparse autoencoder (SAE) combined with an echo state network (ESN) is designed for the fault diagnosis. The SAE is employed to automatically learn features from the high-dimensional attitude data of the delta 3-D printer \u2026",

To this end, an attitude sensor which contained 9 channels is employed for collectingprinter condition data of 3-axial angular velocity, 3-axial vibratory acceleration and 3-axial magnetic field intensity, simultaneously. To make use of the information of multiple sensorsmounted on the moving platform of the printer,multiple sparse auto-encoders (SAEs)are employed for the deep learning of these data.

            "Health condition is a vital factor affecting printing quality for a 3D printer. In this work, an attitude monitoring approach is proposed to diagnose the fault of the delta 3D printer using support vector machines (SVM). An attitude sensor was mounted on the moving platform of the printer to monitor its 3-axial attitude angle, angular velocity, vibratory acceleration and magnetic field intensity. The attitude data of the working printer were collected under different conditions involving 12 fault types and a normal condition. The collected data were analyzed for diagnosing the health condition. To this end, the combination of binary classification, one-against-one with least-square SVM, was adopted for fault diagnosis modelling by using all channels of attitude monitoring data in the experiment. For comparison, each one channel of the attitude monitoring data was employed for model training and testing. On the other hand, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) was also applied to diagnose fault using the same data. The best fault diagnosis accuracy (94.44%) was obtained when all channels of the attitude monitoring data were used with SVM modelling. The results indicate that the attitude monitoring with SVM is an effective method for the fault diagnosis of delta 3D printers. View Full-Text",

However, a single ESN cannot extract effective features from complex inputs, especially for dealing with low-cost condition signals in machinery fault diagnosis. A novel deep learning model, referred to as the deep fuzzy ESN (DFESN), was proposed to improve the feature extraction capability with less computational burden. In the present method, the output data of the previous ESN reservoir were regarded as abstract feature vectors for the next ESN input. The features were reinforced in each hidden layer by using fuzzy clustering as a tuning step for classification enhancement. In this way, layerwise fuzzy tuning was developed to replace traditional overall feedback fine tuning in deep models.

Existing rescheduling models for machine breakdown only employ one constraint that charges cannot be processed on this machine in its failure period. However, this method is effective for steelmaking furnace breakdown and refining furnace breakdown but invalid for continuous caster breakdown.

Moreover, predicting manufacturing quality is one of the crucial measures for quality management. Accurate prediction is closely related to the feature learning of manufacturing processes. Therefore, two categories of intelligent learning approaches, ie, shallow learning and deep learning, are investigated and compared for manufacturing quality prediction in this paper. Specifically, the feed forward neural network (FFNN) with one hidden layer and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) with no hidden layers are selected as the representatives for shallow learning, and the deep restricted Boltzmann machine (DRBM) and the stack autoencoder (SAE) are chosen as the representatives for deep learning. The manufacturing data is collected from a competition about manufacturing quality control in the Tianchi Data Lab of China. The experiments show that the deep framework overwhelms the shallow architecture in terms of mean absolute percentage error, root-mean-square error, and threshold statistics. In addition, the prediction results also indicate that the performances depend on the length of the training data. That is, the bigger the sample size is, the better the performance is.
