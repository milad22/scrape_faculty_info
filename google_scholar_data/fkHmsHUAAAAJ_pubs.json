The ratio of the form factors is directly proportional to the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal components of the polarization of the recoil proton in the elastic e\u2192 p\u2192 e p\u2192 reaction. The new data presented span the range 3.5< Q 2< 5.6 GeV 2 and are well described by a linear Q 2 fit. Also, the ratio Q 2 F 2 p\/F 1 p reaches a constant value above Q 2= 2 GeV 2.",

These measurements were performed using a 5.7 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam and a polarized He 3 target. The results for A 1 n and g 1 n at x= 0.33 are consistent with previous world data and, at the two higher-x points, have improved the precision of the world data by about an order of magnitude. The new A 1 n data show a zero crossing around x= 0.47 and the value at x= 0.60 is significantly positive. These results agree with a next-to-leading-order QCD analysis of previous world data. The trend of data at high x agrees with constituent quark model predictions but disagrees with that from leading-order perturbative QCD (PQCD) assuming hadron helicity \u2026",

The Q 2 dependence (from 1.5 to 2.3 GeV 2) of the helicity-dependent cross section indicates the twist-2 dominance of DVCS, proving that generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are accessible to experiment at moderate Q 2. The helicity-independent cross section is also measured at Q 2= 2.3 GeV 2. We present the first model-independent measurement of linear combinations of GPDs and GPD integrals up to the twist-3 approximation.",

The experiment, conducted at Jefferson Lab using a 5.9 GeV electron beam, covers a range of 0.16< x< 0.35 with 1.4< Q 2< 2.7 GeV 2. The Collins and Sivers moments were extracted from the azimuthal angular dependence of the measured asymmetries. The \u03c0\u00b1Collins moments for He 3 are consistent with zero, except for the \u03c0+ moment at x= 0.35, which deviates from zero by 2.3 \u03c3. While the \u03c0\u2212 Sivers moments are consistent with zero, the \u03c0+ Sivers moments favor negative values. The neutron results were extracted using the nucleon effective polarization and measured cross section ratios of proton to He 3, and are largely consistent with the predictions of phenomenological fits and quark model calculations.",
