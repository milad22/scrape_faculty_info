            "The ability to render objects invisible using a cloak (such that they are not detectable by an external observer) has long been a tantalizing goal 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here, we demonstrate a cloak operating in the near infrared at a wavelength of 1,550 nm. The cloak conceals a deformation on a flat reflecting surface, under which an object can be hidden. The device has an area of 225 \u00b5m 2 and hides a region of 1.6 \u00b5m 2. It is composed of nanometre-size silicon structures with spatially varying densities across the cloak. The density variation is defined using transformation optics to define the effective index distribution of the cloak.",

            "Graphene has generated exceptional interest as an optoelectronic material 1, 2 because its high carrier mobility 3, 4 and broadband absorption 5 promise to make extremely fast and broadband electro-optic devices possible 6, 7, 8, 9. Electro-optic graphene modulators previously reported, however, have been limited in bandwidth to a few gigahertz 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 because of the large capacitance required to achieve reasonable voltage swings. Here, we demonstrate a graphene electro-optic modulator based on resonator loss modulation at critical coupling 16 that shows drastically increased speed and efficiency. Our device operates with a 30 GHz bandwidth and with a state-of-the-art modulation efficiency of 15 dB per 10 V. We also show the first high-speed large-signal operation in a graphene modulator, paving the way for fast digital communications using this platform. The modulator uniquely uses \u2026",
