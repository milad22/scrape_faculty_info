We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential.",

Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), this representation allows for the r s\u2212 3\/4 behavior as r s\u2192\u221e. Close agreement with numerical RPA values for \u025b c (r s, 0), \u025b c (r s, 1), and the spin stiffness \u03b1 c (r s)=\u2202 2 \u025b c (r s, \u03b6= 0)\/\u03b4 \u03b6 2, and recovery of the correct r s ln r s term for r s\u2192 0, indicate the appropriateness of the chosen analytic form.

We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape.

We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems:(1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate.(2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain.(3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation.(4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error \u2026",

Starting from the second-order density gradient expansion, which involves the local spin densities n\u2191(r), n\u2193(r) and their gradients\u2207 n\u2191(r),\u2207 n\u2193(r), we cut off the spurious large-u contributions to restore those exact conditions on the hole that the local spin density (LSD) approximation respects. Our GGA hole recovers the Perdew-Wang 1991 and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA\u2019s for the exchange-correlation energy, which therefore respect the same powerful hole constraints as LSD. When applied to real systems, our hole model provides a more detailed test of these energy functionals, and also predicts the observable electron-electron \u2026",

The basis for this approximation is the gradient expansion of the exchange hole, with real-space cutoffs chosen to guarantee that the hole is negative everywhere and represents a deficit of one electron. Unlike the previously publsihed version of it, this functional is simple enough to be applied routinely in self-consistent calculations for atoms, molecules, and solids. Calculated exchange energies for atoms fall within 1% of Hartree-Fock values. Significant improvements over other simple functionals are also found in the exchange contributions to the valence-shell removal energy of an atom and to the surface energy of jellium within the infinite barrier model.",
