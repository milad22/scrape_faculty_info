            "Mechanochemistry is becoming more widespread as a technique for molecular synthesis with new mechanochemical reactions being discovered at increasing frequency. Whilst mechanochemical methods are solvent free and can therefore lead to improved sustainability metrics, it is more likely that the significant differences between reaction outcomes, reaction selectivities and reduced reaction times will make it a technique of interest to synthetic chemists. Herein, we provide an overview of mechanochemistry reaction examples, with \u2018direct\u2019 comparators to solvent based reactions, which collectively seemingly show that solid state grinding can lead to reduced reaction times, different reaction outcomes in product selectivity and in some instances different reaction products, including products not accessible in solution.",

Similarly, sydnones act as useful and novel precursors for pyrazoles (through cycloaddition with alkynes), which has also served to drive research into their functionalisation and cycloaddition chemistry. This report aims to provide an overview of the recently developed chemistry of sydnones, with particular emphasis on useful reactions for the synthesis of biologically interesting molecules.",

This platform allows for truly continuous pumping of these highly reactive substances (and examples are demonstrated over periods of several hours) to generate multigram quantities of products.
