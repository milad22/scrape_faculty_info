These collective states minimize the interaction energy among condensate atoms, and they are characterized by strong spin correlations. We also examine the internal dynamics of an initially spin-polarized condensate. The time scale of spin mixing is predicted.",

Using a new numerical method, we have calculated ground state wave functions and show that, due to interspecies interactions, the condensate mixture displays novel behavior not found in a pure condensate. We compared our results with those of the Thomas-Fermi approximation (TFA) and find that under a broad range of conditions the TFA can be reliably used to predict many qualitative features of the condensates. Using our technique, we have modeled a recent JILA experiment on dual spin-state 87 Rb condensate. Finally, collective excitations of double condensates are discussed.",

We show that at strong spin-orbit coupling the single-particle spectrum decomposes into different manifolds separated by \u210f \u03c9\u22a5, where \u03c9\u22a5 is the trapping frequency. For a weakly interacting gas, quantum states with Skyrmion lattice patterns emerge spontaneously and preserve either parity symmetry or combined parity-time-reversal symmetry. These phases can be readily observed in a spin-orbit coupled gas of Rb 87 atoms in a highly oblate trap.",
