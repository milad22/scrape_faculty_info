These extended MSSM models can also render the little hierarchy problem less severe, but only for lower values of m h (\u2272 125) GeV. We present estimates for the sparticle mass spectrum in these models.",

We take into account the subleading contributions from new physics (expressed in terms of the X, Y,\u2026 variables), as well as two-loop corrections to the standard model \u03c1 parameter. For the case of one extra dimension, we obtain a lower bound on the inverse compactification scale M= R\u2212 1 of 600 GeV (at 90% confidence level), with a Higgs mass of 115 GeV. However, in contradiction to recent claims, we find that this constraint is significantly relaxed with increasing Higgs mass, allowing for compactification scales as low as 300 GeV.

The same discrete symmetry explains the smallness of the \u03bc-term (the Higgsino mass parameter) via the Giudice\u2013Masiero mechanism. The discrete gauge anomalies are cancelled by a discrete version of the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism. The simplest symmetry group is found to be Z4 with a charge assignment that is compatible with grand unification. Several other ZN gauge symmetries are found for N=10, 12, 18, 36 etc., with some models employing discrete anomaly cancellation at higher Kac\u2013Moody levels. Allowing for a flavor structure in ZN, we show that the same gauge symmetry can also explain the observed hierarchy in the fermion masses and mixings.",

            "We explore the implications of a 124\u2013126 GeV CP-even Higgs boson on the fundamental parameter space and sparticle spectroscopy of the minimal gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (mGMSB) scenario. The above mass for the Higgs boson yields stringent lower bounds on the sparticle masses in this class of models. The lightest neutralino and stau masses lie close to 1.5 TeV and 800 GeV respectively, while the majority of the sparticle masses are in the several to multi-TeV range. We show that with a single pair of 5+ 5\u00af SU (5) messenger multiplets, the lower limit on the gravitino mass is\u223c 360 eV. This is reduced to about 60 eV if five pairs of 5+ 5\u00af messenger fields are introduced. Non-standard cosmology and non-standard gravitino production mechanisms are required in order to satisfy cosmological observations.",
