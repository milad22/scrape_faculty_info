This article provides an overview of the synthesis strategies and characteristics of the next-generation TiO2-based hybrid photocatalysts, produced in combination with polymers (e.g., polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene) and carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, GO, CNT, carbon quantum dots, carbon nitride). The structural aspects, nanostructure formation process, parameters affecting catalytic activity, photocatalytic mechanisms and photocatalytic applications of TiO2-based catalysts for efficient photocatalytic degradation of gaseous\/volatile organic pollutants in water\/air are reviewed.

We report a facile ultrasonic approach with chemical activation using KOH to prepare activated GQDs or aGQDs enriched with both free and bound edges. Compared to GQDs, the aGQDs we synthesized had enhanced BET surface area by a factor of about six, the photoluminescence intensity by about four and half times and electro-capacitance by a factor of about two. Unlike their non-activated counterparts, the aGQDs having enhanced edge states emit enhanced intense blue luminescence and exhibit electrochemical double layer capacitance greater than that of graphene, activated or not.

The governing equations of fluid motion and heat transfer in their vorticity stream function form are used to simulate the nanofluid flow and heat transfer. Control Volume based Finite Element Method (CVFEM) is applied to solve these equations. The effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluid are calculated using the Maxwell\u2013Garnetts (MG) and Brinkman models, respectively. The calculations are performed for different governing parameters such as the Hartmann number, Rayleigh number, nanoparticle volume fraction and inclined angle of inner cylinder.
