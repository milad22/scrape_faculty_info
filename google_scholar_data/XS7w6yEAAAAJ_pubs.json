We construct effective Hamiltonians for the three classes of the two-species (fermion-fermion, boson-boson, and boson-fermion\u2013type) insulators and reveal the conditions when the resulting ground state supports super-counter-fluidity (SCF), with the alternative being phase segregation.

Surprisingly, the quantum phase diagram features, besides second-order lines, first-order transitions and two multicritical points.

The recent discovery of a nonclassical moment of inertia in solid He 4 by Kim and Chan provided the first experimental evidence, although the interpretation in terms of supersolidity of the ideal crystal phase remains a subject to debate. Using quantum Monte Carlo methods we investigate the long-standing question of vacancy-induced superflow and find that vacancies in a He 4 crystal phase separate instead of forming a supersolid. On the other hand, nonequilibrium vacancies relaxing on defects of polycrystalline samples could provide an explanation for the experimental observations.",

            "Feschbach resonances in a non-s-wave channel of two-component bosonic mixtures can induce atomic Bose-Einstein condensates with a nonzero orbital momentum in the optical lattice, if one component is in the Mott insulator state and the other is not. Such non-s-wave condensates break the symmetry of the lattice and, in some cases, time-reversal symmetry. They can be revealed in specific absorption imaging patterns.",
