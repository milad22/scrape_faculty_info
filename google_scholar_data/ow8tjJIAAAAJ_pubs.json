            "Easy axis antiferromagnets usually exhibit a first-order spin-flop transition when the magnetic field is applied along the easy axis. Recently a colossal magnetoelectric effect was discovered in Ni 3 TeO 6, suggesting a continuous spin-flop transition across a narrow phase in this material [Oh et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 3201 (2014)]. Additional evidence is, however, desirable to verify this mechanism. Here we measure the infrared vibrational properties of Ni 3 TeO 6 in high magnetic fields and demonstrate that the phonon anomalies are consistent with a second-order mechanism.",

Both the 185 K ferroelectric transition and the magnetically driven transition to the fully saturated state at 15.3 T involve the formate bending mode, direct evidence of a common connection between the two types of ferroicities and for how lattice distortions promote high-temperature magnetoelectric coupling in this system.",
