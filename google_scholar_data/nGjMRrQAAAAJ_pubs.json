            "The High Resolution Fly\u2019s Eye (HiRes) experiment has observed the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin suppression (called the GZK cutoff) with a statistical significance of five standard deviations. HiRes\u2019 measurement of the flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays shows a sharp suppression at an energy of 6\u00d7 10 19 eV, consistent with the expected cutoff energy. We observe the ankle of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum as well, at an energy of 4\u00d7 10 18 eV. We describe the experiment, data collection, and analysis and estimate the systematic uncertainties. The results are presented and the calculation of the statistical significance of our observation is described.",

We compare these four K\u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 decay rates to measure the direct CP violation parameter Re (\u03b5\u2032\/\u03b5)=(20.7\u00b12. 8)\u00d7 10\u2212 4. We also test CPT symmetry by measuring the relative phase between the CP violating and CP conserving decay amplitudes for K\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212(\u03c6+\u2212) and for K\u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (\u03c6 00).

We compare these four K\u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 decay rates to measure the direct CP violation parameter Re (\u03b5\u2032\/\u03b5)=(20.7\u00b12. 8)\u00d7 10\u2212 4. We also test CPT symmetry by measuring the relative phase between the CP violating and CP conserving decay amplitudes for K\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212(\u03c6+\u2212) and for K\u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (\u03c6 00). We find the difference between the relative phases to be \u0394 \u03c6\u2261 \u03c6 00\u2212 \u03c6+\u2212=(+ 0.39\u00b10. 5 0), and the deviation of \u03c6+\u2212 from the superweak phase to be \u03c6+\u2212\u2212 \u03c6 SW=(+ 0.61\u00b11. 1 9); both results are consistent with CPT symmetry. In addition, we present new measurements of the K L-K S mass difference and K S lifetime: \u0394 m=(5261\u00b11 5)\u00d7 10 6 \u0127 s\u2212 1 and \u03c4 S=(89.65\u00b10. 0 7)\u00d7 10\u2212 12 s.",
