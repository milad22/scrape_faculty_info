            "The scope of this work is to provide a self-contained introduction to a selection of basic theoretical aspects in the modeling and control of quantum mechanical systems, as well as a brief survey on the main approaches to control synthesis. While part of the existing theory, especially in the open-loop setting, stems directly from classical control theory (most notably geometric control and optimal control), a number of tools specifically tailored for quantum systems have been developed since the 1980s, in order to take into account their distinctive features: the probabilistic nature of atomic-scale physical systems, the effect of dissipation and the irreversible character of the measurements have all proved to be critical in feedback-design problems. The relevant dynamical models for both closed and open quantum systems are presented, along with the main results on their controllability and stability. A brief review of several \u2026",

Markovian dynamics describes a wide class of open quantum systems of relevance to quantum information processing, subsystem encodings offering a general pathway to faithfully represent quantum information. We provide explicit linear-algebraic characterizations of the notion of invariant and noiseless subsystem for Markovian master equations, under different robustness assumptions for model-parameter and initial-state variations. The stronger concept of an attractive quantum subsystem is introduced, and sufficient existence conditions are identified based on Lyapunov's stability techniques.

We define consensus situations on the basis of invariance and symmetry properties, finding four different generalizations of classical consensus states. This new viewpoint can be directly used to study consensus for probability distributions, as these can be seen as a particular case of quantum statistical states: in this light, our analysis is also relevant for classical problems. We then extend the gossip consensus algorithm to the quantum setting and prove it converges to symmetric states while preserving the expectation of permutation-invariant global observables. Applications of the framework and the algorithms to estimation and control problems on quantum networks are discussed.",

In both cases, we provide algorithms for constructing a master equation that achieves the intended objective and show how this can genuinely extend the manifold of stabilizable states. In particular, we present quasi-local control protocols for dissipatively engineering multipartite GHZ\" cat\" states and W states on  qubits. For GHZ states, we find that no scalable procedure exists for achieving stabilization from arbitrary initial states, whereas this is possible for a target W state by a suitable combination of a two-body Hamiltonian and dissipators.
