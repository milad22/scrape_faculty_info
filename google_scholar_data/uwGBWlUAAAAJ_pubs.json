Since the anomalous scattering causes both anomalous currents and a finite spin-diffusion length, we derive the spin Hall effect in the presence of spin diffusion from a semiclassical Boltzmann equation. When the formulation is applied to certain metals and semiconductors, the magnitude of the spin Hall voltage due to the spin accumulation is found to be much larger than that of magnetic multilayers. An experiment is proposed to measure this spin Hall effect.",

This spin torque does not involve spin transfer mechanism and originates from the band structure itself. We show that this spin torque can be effectively used to switch the direction of the magnetization and the critical switching current density could be as low as 10 4\u201310 6 A\/cm 2 for a number of magnetic systems. Several magnetic systems for possible experimental realization are discussed.",

            "The combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and exchange interaction in a single ferromagnetic layer is investigated. It is shown that, in nonequilibrium regime, the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gives rise to a transverse spin density that exerts a torque on the local magnetization. The spin torque depends on the symmetry properties of the SOI. For the inversion-symmetry-preserved SOI such as the impurity SOI and the Luttinger spin-orbit band, the spin torque is a high-order effect too small to lead to a reasonable critical switching current density. For the inversion-symmetry-broken SOI, eg, Rashba and Dresselhaus SOIs, the torque is on the first order of the SOI parameter and can be effectively used to control the magnetization direction using critical switching current densities as low as 10 4\u201310 6 A\/cm 2. We also address the relation between the spin torque and the anisotropic magnetoresistance. Finally, a number of \u2026",
