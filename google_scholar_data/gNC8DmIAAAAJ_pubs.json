            "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a major class of biopharmaceuticals. It is hypothesized that some concentrated mAb solutions exhibit formation of a solution phase consisting of reversibly self-associated aggregates (or reversible clusters), which is speculated to be responsible for their distinct solution properties. Here, we report direct observation of reversible clusters in concentrated solutions of mAbs using neutron spin echo. Specifically, a stable mAb solution is studied across a transition from dispersed monomers in dilute solution to clustered states at more concentrated conditions, where clusters of a preferred size are observed. Once mAb clusters have formed, their size, in contrast to that observed in typical globular protein solutions, is observed to remain nearly constant over a wide range of concentrations. Our results not only conclusively establish a clear relationship between the undesirable high viscosity \u2026",

The diffraction patterns show two distinct peaks appeared at scattering vectors Q of 0.3 and 1.0 \u00c5\u20131. The former originates from the nanoscale structure characteristic to ionic liquids and the latter due to the interionic correlations. Interestingly, the intensity of the low-Q peak drastically grows upon cooling and keeps growing even below the glass transition temperature. The NSE measurements have been performed at these two Q positions, to explore the time evolution of each correlation. The relaxation related to the ionic correlation (ionic diffusion) is of Arrhenius-type and exhibits nonexponential behavior. The activation energy (Ea) of the ionic diffusion \u2026",

            "Thickness fluctuations have long been predicted in biological membranes but never directly observed experimentally. Here, we utilize neutron spin echo spectroscopy to experimentally reveal such fluctuations in a pure, fully saturated, phosphocholine lipid bilayer system. These fluctuations appear as an excess in the dynamics of undulation fluctuations. Like the bending rigidity, the thickness fluctuations change dramatically as the lipid transition temperature is crossed, appearing to be completely suppressed below the transition. Above the transition, the relaxation rate is on the order of 100 ns and is independent of temperature. The amplitude of the thickness fluctuations is 3.7 \u00c5\u00b10.7 \u00c5, which agrees well with theoretical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The dependence of the fluctuations on lipid tail lengths is also investigated and determined to be minimal in the range of 14 to 18 carbon tails.",

As observed in the phase diagram of aqueous solutions of proteins, the cloud point temperatures (Tcloud) were a function of the pressure, P, and had maxima at P0 = 51.7 MPa and P0 = 93.2 MPa respectively for the solution and gel in H2O. The difference in Tcloud indicates that the effect of cross-linking is significant, and it leads to an increase of the miscible region.

In the neutron diffraction measurement for a deuterated analogue, d-C8mimCl, the peaks associated with the inter-domain, inter-ionic, and inter-alkyl-chain correlations appeared at (3, 11, and 14) nm\u22121, respectively.

            "We have used neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy to study the effect of bilayer thickness and monounsaturation (existence of a single double bond on one of the aliphatic chains) on the physical properties of unilamellar vesicles. The bending elasticity of saturated and monounsaturated phospholipid bilayers made of phospholipids with alkyl chain length ranging from 14 to 20 carbons was investigated. The bending elasticity \u03ba c of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in the liquid crystalline (L \u03b1) phase ranges from 0.38\u00d7 10\u2212 19 J for 1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to 0.64\u00d7 10\u2212 19 J for 1, 2-dieicosenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. It was confirmed that, contrary to the strong effect on the main transition temperature, the monounsaturation has a limited influence on the bending elasticity of lipid bilayers. In addition, when the area modulus K A varies little with chain unsaturation or length, the elastic ratios (\u03ba c \u2026",
