            "The development of optical gain in chemically synthesized semiconductor nanoparticles (nanocrystal quantum dots) has been intensely studied as the first step toward nanocrystal quantum dot lasers. We examined the competing dynamical processes involved in optical amplification and lasing in nanocrystal quantum dots and found that, despite a highly efficient intrinsic nonradiative Auger recombination, large optical gain can be developed at the wavelength of the emitting transition for close-packed solids of these dots. Narrowband stimulated emission with a pronounced gain threshold at wavelengths tunable with the size of the nanocrystal was observed, as expected from quantum confinement effects. These results unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of nanocrystal quantum dot lasers.",

In such experiments, a laser pulse normally excites several nanostructures at once. However, spectroscopic information may also be acquired using pulses from an electron beam in a modern electron microscope, exploiting a phenomenon called cathodoluminescence. This approach offers several advantages. The multimode imaging capabilities of the electron microscope enable the correlation of optical properties (via cathodoluminescence) with surface morphology (secondary electron mode) at the nanometre scale 2. The broad energy range of the electrons can excite wide-bandgap materials, such as diamond-or gallium-nitride-based structures that are not easily excited by conventional optical means.

We observe that for NCs prepared in such a commonly used solvent as hexane, the contribution from photoinduced absorption rapidly increases with decreasing NC radius, and it completely suppresses optical gain in NCs of small sizes. Further, the magnitude of photoinduced absorption is sensitive both to the type and the quality of surface passivation, as well as to the identity of the solvent\/matrix material.

            "We report a systematic study of photoluminescence (PL) intensity and lifetime fluctuations in individual CdSe\/CdS core\/shell nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) as a function of shell thickness. We show that while at low pump intensities PL blinking in thin-shell (4\u20137 monolayers, MLs) NQDs can be described by random switching between two states of high (ON) and low (OFF) emissivities, it changes to the regime with a continuous distribution of ON intensity levels at high pump powers. A similar behavior is observed in samples with a medium shell thickness (10\u201312 MLs) without, however, the PL intensity ever switching to a complete \u201cOFF\u201d state and maintaining ca. 30% emissivity (\u201cgray\u201d state). Further, our data indicate that highly stable, blinking-free PL of thick-shell (15\u201319 MLs) NQDs (\u201cgiant\u201d or g-NQDs) is characterized by nearly perfect Poisson statistics, corresponding to a narrow, shot-noise limited PL intensity \u2026",
