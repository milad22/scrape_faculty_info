            "In the first quarter of the twentieth century, one of the most significant events in physics and chemistry was the establishment of the quantum theories of radiation, matter, and their interactions. According to these revolutionary theories, a radiation (light) field consists of one type of unit, namely photons, while matter consists of another type of unit, namely molecules or atoms. Through the interaction between these two types of elementary particles, there is an energy exchange between the radiation and the matter, which in general can be described as the absorption or emission of photons by the matter. In the early developmental stage of the quantum theories, scientists mostly considered only the processes of either one-photon absorption or one-photon emission; both processes were easily observed under common experimental conditions and in our daily life. The substance of a one-photon process is that a \u2026",

This study attempts to determine certain molecular structure\/effective two-photon absorption relationships by careful characterization and as a function of systematically varied changes in the organic structure of the dye molecules. Such information can be useful in the design of more efficient two-photon dyes for imaging and power-limiting applications. The results of the study indicate that with the incorporation of certain combinations of structural elements, dyes can be synthesized which have greatly increased effective cross sections as \u2026",

            "Luminescent silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) have great potential for use in biological imaging and diagnostic applications. To exploit this potential, they must remain luminescent and stably dispersed in water and biological fluids over a wide range of pH and salt concentration. There have been many challenges in creating such stable water-dispersible Si QDs, including instability of photoluminescence due their fast oxidation in aqueous environments and the difficulty of attaching hydrophilic molecules to Si QD surfaces. In this paper, we report the preparation of highly stable aqueous suspensions of Si QDs using phospholipid micelles, in which the optical properties of Si nanocrystals are retained. These luminescent micelle-encapsulated Si QDs were used as luminescent labels for pancreatic cancer cells. This paves the way for silicon quantum dots to be a valuable optical probe in biomedical diagnostics.",
