            "X-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray Raman scattering were used to probe the molecular arrangement in the first coordination shell of liquid water. The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen\u2013bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen\u2013bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C, 5 to 10% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen\u2013bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water. Serious discrepancies with structures based on current molecular dynamics simulations are observed.",

            "The creation of a 1s core hole in a 3d transition metal ion gives rise to an emission spectrum that can be recorded using a crystal analyzer. K shell X-ray spectroscopy using an analyser energy bandwidth of \u223c1 eV is sensitive to electron\u2013electron interactions and orbital splittings and preserves the advantages of the hard X-ray probe. We review recent developments in K\u03b1 and K\u03b2 spectroscopy and show how the chemical sensitivity of the fluorescence lines can be exploited for selective X-ray absorption studies. When the photo excitation energy is tuned close to the K edge threshold, the phenomenon known as X-ray resonant Raman or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) occurs. RIXS spectroscopy on 3d transition metals at the 1s resonances with lowest incident energies (K pre-edge) is a very recent technique. We discuss basic aspects and demonstrate with several examples its potential as a future routine \u2026",

Despite insight from structural and biochemical studies, its structure and mechanism await full characterization. An iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is thought to be the site of dinitrogen reduction, but the identity of a central atom in this cofactor remains unknown. Fe K\u03b2 x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of intact nitrogenase MoFe protein, isolated FeMoco, and the FeMoco-deficient \u2206nifB protein indicates that among the candidate atoms oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, it is carbon that best fits the XES data. The experimental XES is supported by computational efforts, which show that oxidation and spin states do not affect the assignment of the central atom to C4\u2013. Identification of the central atom will drive further studies on its role in catalysis.",

These studies reveal that the conditions used for structure determination by x-ray crystallography cause serious damage specifically to the metal-site structure. The x-ray absorption spectra show that the structure changes from one that is characteristic of a high-valent Mn4(III2,IV2) oxo-bridged Mn4Ca cluster to that of Mn(II) in aqueous solution. This damage to the metal site occurs at a dose that is more than one order of magnitude lower than the dose that results in loss of diffractivity and is commonly considered safe for protein crystallography. These results establish quantitative x-ray dose parameters that are applicable to redox-active metalloproteins. This case study shows that a careful \u2026",

In contrast, the magnitude of fluctuations in a normal liquid, such as CCl4, exhibits no enhancement with decreasing temperature, as is also the case for water from molecular dynamics simulations under ambient conditions. Based on X-ray emission spectroscopy and X-ray Raman scattering data we propose that the density difference contrast in SAXS is due to fluctuations between tetrahedral-like and hydrogen-bond distorted structures related to, respectively, low and high density water.

The existence of fast sound is therefore demonstrated in an energy-momentum region much wider than that of previous neutron measurements on D 2 O. The equivalence of the fast sound velocity in H 2 O and in D 2 O rules out models where this mode propagates only on the hydrogen network. These results show the ability of inelastic x-ray scattering to study the collective dynamics of liquids.",
