            "We demonstrate field-effect transistors using heterogeneously stacked two-dimensional materials for all of the components, including the semiconductor, insulator, and metal layers. Specifically, MoS2 is used as the active channel material, hexagonal-BN as the top-gate dielectric, and graphene as the source\/drain and the top-gate contacts. This transistor exhibits n-type behavior with an ON\/OFF current ratio of >106, and an electron mobility of \u223c33 cm2\/V\u00b7s. Uniquely, the mobility does not degrade at high gate voltages, presenting an important advantage over conventional Si transistors where enhanced surface roughness scattering severely reduces carrier mobilities at high gate-fields. A WSe2\u2013MoS2 diode with graphene contacts is also demonstrated. The diode exhibits excellent rectification behavior and a low reverse bias current, suggesting high quality interfaces between the stacked layers. In this work, all \u2026",

Here, we experimentally demonstrate interlayer band-to-band tunneling in vertical MoS2\/WSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures using a dual-gate device architecture. The electric potential and carrier concentration of MoS2 and WSe2 layers are independently controlled by the two symmetric gates. The same device can be gate modulated to behave as either an Esaki diode with negative differential resistance, a backward diode with large reverse bias tunneling current, or a forward rectifying diode with low reverse bias current. Notably, a high gate coupling efficiency of \u223c80% is obtained for tuning the interlayer band alignments, arising from weak electrostatic screening by the atomically thin layers.

We demonstrate 2D-2D tunneling in a WSe2\/SnSe2 van der Waals vertical heterojunction device, where WSe2 is used as the gate controlled p-layer and SnSe2 is the degenerately n-type layer. The van der Waals gap facilitates the regulation of band alignment at the heterojunction, without the necessity of a tunneling barrier. ZrO2 is used as the gate dielectric, allowing the scaling of gate oxide to improve device subthreshold swing. Efficient gate control and clean interfaces yield a subthreshold swing of \u223c100\u2009mV\/dec for >2 decades of drain current at room temperature, hitherto unobserved in 2D-2D tunneling devices.

            "When light is incident on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), it engages in multiple reflections within underlying substrates, producing interferences that lead to enhancement or attenuation of the incoming and outgoing strength of light. Here, we report a simple method to engineer the light outcoupling in semiconducting TMDCs by modulating their dielectric surroundings. We show that by modulating the thicknesses of underlying substrates and capping layers, the interference caused by substrate can significantly enhance the light absorption and emission of WSe2, resulting in a \u223c11 times increase in Raman signal and a \u223c30 times increase in the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of WSe2. On the basis of the interference model, we also propose a strategy to control the photonic and optoelectronic properties of thin-layer WSe2.

However, the presence of large contact resistances is still a fundamental challenge in the field. In this work, we study defect engineering by using a mild plasma treatment (He or H2) as an approach to reduce the contact resistance to WSe2. Material characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirm defect-induced n-doping, up to degenerate level, which is attributed to the creation of anion (Se) vacancies. The plasma treatment is adopted in the fabrication process flow of WSe2 n-type metal-oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors to selectively create anion vacancies at the metal contact regions.

The primary factors affecting the single event pulse width in triple-well NMOSFETs are the separation of deposited charge due to the n-well, potential rise in the p-well followed by the injection of electrons into the p-well by the source, and removal of holes by the p-well contact. Design parameters of p-wells, such as contact area, doping depth and placement, are varied to reduce single event pulse widths. Pulse width decreases as the area of the p-well contacts increases, the p-well contacts become deeper, and the p-well contacts are placed more frequently. Increasing the p-well-n-well junction depth also causes the full width half rail (FWHR) pulse width to decrease.",
