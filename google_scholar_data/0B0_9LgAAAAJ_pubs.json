            "A new version of the DelPhi program, which provides numerical solutions to the nonlinear Poisson\u2212Boltzmann (PB) equation, is reported. The program can divide space into multiple regions containing different dielectric constants and can treat systems containing mixed salt solutions where the valence and concentration of each ion is different. The electrostatic free energy is calculated by decomposing the various energy terms into Coulombic interactions so that that the calculated free energies are independent of the lattice used to solve the PB equation. This, together with algorithms that optimally position polarization charges on the molecular surface, leads to a significant decrease in the dependence of the electrostatic free energy on the resolution of the lattice used to solve the PB equation and, hence, to a remarkable improvement in the precision of the calculated values.

The algorithms are incorporated in the DelPhi program. The first algorithm involves an efficient and accurate semianalytical method to map the molecular surface of a molecule onto a three\u2010dimensional lattice. This method constitutes a significant improvement over existing methods in terms of its combination of speed and accuracy. The DelPhi program has also been expanded to allow the definition of geometrical objects such as spheres, cylinders, cones, and parallelepipeds, which can be used to describe a system that may also include a standard atomic level depiction of molecules. Each object can have a different dielectric constant and a different surface or volume charge \u2026",

In situ residue pKas also provides a sensitive measure of the local protein environment.

The response of protein to charges is incorporated both in the protein dielectric constant (\u025bprot) of four and by explicit conformational changes. The pKa of 166 residues in 12 proteins was determined. The root mean square error is 0.83 pH units, and >90% have errors of <1 pH units whereas only 3% have errors >2 pH units. Similar results are found with crystal and solution structures, showing that the method's explicit conformational sampling reduces sensitivity to the initial structure. The outcome also \u2026",

Electrostatic, Lennard-Jones potentials, and torsion angle energies are considered at each proton position. Many acidic and basic residues are found to have significant electrostatic interactions with either a water- or hydroxyl-containing side chain. Protonation state changes are coupled to reorientation of the neighboring hydroxyl dipoles, resulting in smaller free energy differences between neutral and ionized residues than when the protein is held rigid.

            "The pKa\u2010cooperative aims to provide a forum for experimental and theoretical researchers interested in protein pKa values and protein electrostatics in general. The first round of the pKa\u2010cooperative, which challenged computational labs to carry out blind predictions against pKas experimentally determined in the laboratory of Bertrand Garcia\u2010Moreno, was completed and results discussed at the Telluride meeting (July 6\u201310, 2009). This article serves as an introduction to the reports submitted by the blind prediction participants that will be published in a special issue of PROTEINS: Structure, Function and Bioinformatics. Here, we briefly outline existing approaches for pKa calculations, emphasizing methods that were used by the participants in calculating the blind pKa values in the first round of the cooperative. We then point out some of the difficulties encountered by the participating groups in making their blind \u2026",

            "Biological macromolecules evolved to perform their function in specific cellular environment (subcellular compartments or tissues); therefore, they should be adapted to the biophysical characteristics of the corresponding environment, one of them being the characteristic pH. Many macromolecular properties are pH dependent, such as activity and stability. However, only activity is biologically important, while stability may not be crucial for the corresponding reaction. Here, we show that the pH\u2010optimum of activity (the pH of maximal activity) is correlated with the pH\u2010optimum of stability (the pH of maximal stability) on a set of 310 proteins with available experimental data. We speculate that such a correlation is needed to allow the corresponding macromolecules to tolerate small pH fluctuations that are inevitable with cellular function. Our findings rationalize the efforts of correlating the pH of maximal stability and the \u2026",
