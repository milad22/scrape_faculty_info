            "Different conceptual perspectives converge to predict that if individuals are stressed, an encounter with most unthreatening natural environments will have a stress reducing or restorative influence, whereas many urban environments will hamper recuperation. Hypotheses regarding emotional, attentional and physiological aspects of stress reducing influences of nature are derived from a psycho-evolutionary theory. To investigate these hypotheses, 120 subjects first viewed a stressful movie, and then were exposed to color\/sound videotapes of one of six different natural and urban settings. Data concerning stress recovery during the environmental presentations were obtained from self-ratings of affective states and a battery of physiological measures: heart period, muscle tension, skin conductance and pulse transit time, a non-invasive measure that correlates with systolic blood pressure.

            "Affect is central to conscious experience and behavior in any environment, whether natural or built, crowded or unpopulated. Because virtually no meaningful thoughts, actions, or environmental encounters occur without affect (Ittelson, 1973, p. 16; Izard, 1977; Zajonc, 1980), an affective state is an important indicator of the nature and significance of a person\u2019s ongoing interaction with an environment (Lazarus, Kanner, & Folkman, 1980, p. 190). Research concerning affective and aesthetic response, therefore, may have a central role in advancing our understanding of human interactions with the natural environment and could prove pivotal in the development of comprehensive theories. Further, this area of research relates to important questions in environmental planning and design, including, for instance, visual landscape assessment, the provision of vegetation and parks in cities, and issues of wilderness \u2026",

Thegardens of the ancient Egyptian nobility, the walled gardens of Persian settlements in Mesopotamia, and the gardens of merchants in medieval Chinese cities indicate that early urban peoples went to considerable lengths to maintain contact with nature (Shepard 1967; Hongxun 1982). During the last two centuries, in several countries, the idea that exposure to nature fosters psychological wellbeing, reduces the stresses of urban living, and promotes physical health has formed part of the justification for providing parks and other nature in cities and preserving wilderness for public use (Parsons 1991; Ulrich et al. 1991). These notions might be considered early forms of the biophilia hypothesis. But EO Wilson's interpretation of biophilia (1984) is not limited to the proposition that humans are characterized by a tendency to pay attention to, affiliate with, or otherwise respond positively to nature.

The information rates of the three slide samples were equivalent. Measurements were taken of the effects of the slide presentations on alpha amplitude, heart rate, and emotional states. Results revealed several significant differences as a function of environment, which together indicate that the two categories of nature views had more positive influences on psychophysiological states than the urban scenes. Alpha was significantly higher during the vegetation as opposed to urban slides; similarly, alpha was higher on the average when subjects viewed water rather than urban content.

The survey is set within a conceptual perspective suggesting that affective responses such as aesthetic preference are central to a landscape observer's thoughts, conscious experience and behavior. Substantial progress has been made in developing models that relate aesthetic responses to specific visual properties of environments. When aesthetic preferences are compared for urban and unspectacular natural views, American and European adult groups evidence a strong tendency to prefer nature.

            "The findings suggest that stressed individuals feel significantly better after exposure to nature scenes rather than to American urban scenes lacking nature elements. Compared to the influences of the urban scenes, the salient effect of the nature exposures was to increase Positive Affect \u2014 including feelings of affection friendliness, playfulness, and elation. The increase in positive affect produced by the nature scenes is consistent with the finding that the nature exposures also significantly reduced Fear Arousal. According to psychological theories, a reduction in arousal or activation produces pleasurable feelings if an individual is experiencing stress or excessive arousal (Berlyne, 1971, pp. 81\u201382). In contrast to the nature scenes, the urban views tended to work against emotional well\u2010being. The major effect of the urban scenes was to significantly increase Sadness. There was also \u2026",

This emphasis has often produced facilities that are functionally effective but psychologically \u201chard.\" There is a growing recognition that hard designs are unsatisfactory from the stancipoint of marketing facilities to patients. More fundamentally, hard facilities usually fail because they are stressful or other-wise unsuited to the psychological needs of patients, visitors, and staff. There is increasing sci-entific evidence that poor design works against the well-being of patients and in certain instances can have negative effects on physiological indicators of wellness. Research has linked poor design to such negative consequences for patients as, for instance, anxicty, delirium, elevated blood pres-sure, and increased intake of pain drugs (eg, Wilson, 1972 \u2026",
