            "We compare the dark current-voltage (IV) characteristics of three different thin-film solar cell types: hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n cells, organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) cells, and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) cells. All three device types exhibit a significant shunt leakage current at low forward bias (V<\u223c0.4) and reverse bias, which cannot be explained by the classical solar cell diode model. This parasitic shunt current exhibits non-Ohmic behavior, as opposed to the traditional constant shunt resistance model for photovoltaics. We show here that this shunt leakage (Ish), across all three solar cell types considered, is characterized by the following common phenomenological features: (a) voltage symmetry about V=0, (b) nonlinear (power law) voltage dependence, and (c) extremely weak temperature dependence. Based on this analysis, we provide a simple method of subtracting this shunt current \u2026",

An optical transmission increase of 15% indicates a trapping event for the 40 nm particle, and the jump is 2% for the 20 nm particle. This modular technique can be used to replace those used with current optical trapping setups that require complicated free space optics and frequent calibration, with one that is modular and requires no free space optics.

However, an efficient cascaded logic structure that exploits electron spin has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we introduce and analyse a cascaded spintronic computing system composed solely of low-dimensional carbon materials. We propose a spintronic switch based on the recent discovery of negative magnetoresistance in graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate its feasibility through tight-binding calculations of the band structure. Covalently connected carbon nanotubes create magnetic fields through graphene nanoribbons, cascading logic gates through incoherent spintronic switching.

Here we examine the influence of surface roughness on this plasmonic ruler in the nonlocal regime by comparing plasmonic resonance shifts for as-deposited and for ultra-flat Au films. It is shown that the resonance shift is larger for ultra-flat films, suggesting that there is not the saturation from nonlocal effects previously reported for the spacer range from 0.7 nm to 1.6 nm. We attribute the previously reported saturation to the planarization of the as-deposited films by thinner SAMs, as measured here by atomic-force microscopy. This work is of interest both in probing the ultimate limits of plasmonic enhancement with SAMs for applications in Raman and nonlinear optics, but also in the study of \u2026",
