Nonrelativistic QCD bottom quarks and highly improved staggered quark charm and light quarks are employed together with N f= 2+ 1 MILC gauge configurations. A joint fit to our lattice and BABAR experimental data allows an extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element| V c b|. We also determine the phenomenologically interesting ratio R (D)= B (B\u2192 D \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4)\/B (B\u2192 D l \u03bd l)(l= e, \u03bc). We find| V c b| excl B\u2192 D= 0.0402 (17)(13), where the first error consists of the lattice simulation errors and the experimental statistical error and the second error is the experimental systematic error. For the branching fraction ratio we find R (D)= 0.300 (8).",

The new calculations improve on HPQCD\u2019s earlier work with NRQCD b-quarks by replacing AsqTad with HISQ valence quarks, by including a more chiral MILC fine ensemble in the analysis, and by employing better tuned quark masses and overall scale. We find f B= 0.191 (9) GeV, f B s= 0.228 (10) GeV and f B s\/f B= 1.188 (18). Combining the new value for f B s\/f B with a recent very precise determination of the B s meson decay constant based on HISQ b-quarks, f B s= 0.225 (4) GeV, leads to f B= 0.189 (4) GeV.

The form factor is obtained from a scalar current matrix element that does not require any operator matching. We develop a new approach to carrying out chiral\/continuum extrapolations of f 0 (q 2). The method uses the kinematic \u201cz\u201d variable instead of q 2 or the kaon energy E K and is applicable over the entire physical q 2 range. We find f 0 D\u2192 K (0)\u2261 f+ D\u2192 K (0)= 0.747 (19) in the chiral plus continuum limit and hereby improve the theory error on this quantity by a factor of\u223c 4 compared to previous lattice determinations.
