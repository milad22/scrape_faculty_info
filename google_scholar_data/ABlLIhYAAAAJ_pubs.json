            "Integrated optical circuits based on silicon-on-insulator technology are likely to become the mainstay of the photonics industry. Over recent years an impressive range of silicon-on-insulator devices has been realized, including waveguides 1, 2, filters 3, 4 and photonic-crystal devices 5. However, silicon-based all-optical switching is still challenging owing to the slow dynamics of two-photon generated free carriers. Here we show that silicon\u2013organic hybrid integration overcomes such intrinsic limitations by combining the best of two worlds, using mature CMOS processing to fabricate the waveguide, and molecular beam deposition to cover it with organic molecules that efficiently mediate all-optical interaction without introducing significant absorption. We fabricate a 4-mm-long silicon\u2013organic hybrid waveguide with a record nonlinearity coefficient of \u03b3\u2248 1\u00d7 10 5 W\u2212 1 km\u2212 1 and perform all-optical demultiplexing of \u2026",

Phase-matching curves as a function of wavelength, propagation direction, and temperature are given. Both type I and type II phase matching are found to be possible in KNbO_3 for second-harmonic generation and for sum-frequency generation and optical parametric oscillation. To demonstrate the precision of the calculations based on the new refractive-index data, we compare experimentally measured values with calculated values of acceptance angles, phase-matching angles, and phase-matching temperatures for some specific cases. A temperature-tuned optical parametric oscillator employing KNbO_3 is demonstrated. Good agreement is found between calculated and experimental results.",
