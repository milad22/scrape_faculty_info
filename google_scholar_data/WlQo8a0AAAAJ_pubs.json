            "Muscle mass decreases with age, leading to \u201csarcopenia, \u201d or low relative muscle mass, in elderly people. Sarcopenia is believed to be associated with metabolic, physiologic, and functional impairments and disability. Methods of estimating the prevalence of sarcopenia and its associated risks in elderly populations are lacking. Data from a population-based survey of 883 elderly Hispanic and non-Hispanic white men and women living in New Mexico (the New Mexico Elder Health Survey, 1993\u20131995) were analyzed to develop a method for estimating the prevalence of sarcopenia. An anthropometric equation for predicting appendicular skeletal muscle mass was developed from a random subsample(n = 199) of participants and was extended to the total sample. Sarcopenia was defined as appendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg)\/height2 (m2) being less than two standard deviations below the mean of a young \u2026",

The gender differences were greater in the upper (40%) than lower (33%) body (P< 0.01). We observed a reduction in relative SM mass starting in the third decade; however, a noticeable decrease in absolute SM mass was not observed until the end of the fifth decade. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in lower body SM. Weight and height explained\u223c 50% of the variance in SM mass in men and women.

            "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) are promising reference methods for quantifying whole body and regional skeletal muscle mass. Earlier MRI and CT validation studies used data-acquisition techniques and data-analysis procedures now outdated, evaluated anatomic rather than adipose tissue-free skeletal muscle (ATFSM), studied only the relatively large thigh, or found unduly large estimation errors. The aim of the present study was to compare arm and leg ATFSM cross-sectional area estimates (cm2) by using standard MRI and CT acquisition and image-analysis methods with corresponding cadaver estimates. A second objective was to validate MRI and CT measurements of adipose tissue embedded within muscle (interstitial adipose tissue) and surrounding muscle (subcutaneous adipose tissue). ATFSM area (n = 119) by MRI [38.9 \u00b1 22.3 (SD) cm2], CT (39.7 \u00b1 22.8 cm2 \u2026",

            " Background: It is unknown whether the ability of waist circumference (WC) to predict health risk beyond that predicted by body mass index (BMI) alone is explained in part by the ability of WC to identify those with elevated concentrations of total or abdominal fat. Objective: We sought to determine whether BMI and WC independently contribute to the prediction of nonabdominal (total fat \u2212 abdominal fat), abdominal subcutaneous, and visceral fat. Design: Fat distribution was measured by magnetic resonance imaging in 341 white men and women. Multiple regression analysis was performed to measure whether the combination of BMI and WC explained a greater variance in nonabdominal, abdominal subcutaneous, and visceral fat than did BMI or WC alone. These fat depots were also compared after a subdivision of the cohort into 3 BMI (normal, overweight, and class I obese) and 3 \u2026",
