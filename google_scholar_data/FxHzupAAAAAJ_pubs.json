Three\u2010dimensional scaffolds were created by deep reactive ion etching of silicon wafers to create an array of channels (through\u2010holes) with cell\u2010adhesive walls. Scaffolds were combined with a cell\u2010retaining filter and support in a reactor housing designed to deliver a continuous perfusate across the top of the array and through the 3D tissue mass in each channel. Reactor dimensions were constructed so that perfusate flow rates meet estimated values of cellular oxygen demands while providing fluid shear stress at or below a physiological range (<2 dyne cm2), as determined by comparison of numerical models of reactor fluid flow patterns to literature values of physiological shear stresses.

Although tremendous progress has been made in identifying the biochemical components necessary for actin-based motility, the precise biophysical mechanisms of force generation remain unclear. To probe the polymerization forces quantitatively, we introduce an experimental system in which lipid vesicles coated with the Listeria monocytogenes virulence factor ActA are propelled by actin polymerization. The polymerization forces cause significant deformations of the vesicle. We have used these deformations to obtain a spatially resolved measure of the forces exerted on the membrane using a model based on the competition between osmotic pressure and membrane stretching.

Membrane tubules are pulled from large aggregates of ER or Golgi by microtubule motors to form ER tubulovesicular networks or Golgi tubules both in vivo and in vitro. The physical properties of membranes are critical for membrane traffic and organelle morphology. For example, tension applied to membranes can create tethers, drive membrane flow, and set the diameter of the tubules. Here, we formed ER and Golgi membrane networks in vitro and used optical tweezers to measure directly, for the first time, the membrane tensions of these organelles to clarify the possible role of tension in membrane flow.

In both aggregates, cells perform a persistent random walk, with the diffusion constant smaller in the more cohesive endodermal aggregate. We show that a simple parametric method is able to describe cell deformations and relate them to displacements.

One of the challenges in understanding eukaryotic cell motility is to dissect the elementary biochemical and biophysical steps that link actin polymerization to mechanical force generation. Recently, significant progress was made using biomimetic, in vitro systems that are inspired by the actin-based motility of bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes.

            "The activation of the BCR, which initiates B cell activation, is triggered by Ag-induced self-aggregation and clustering of receptors at the cell surface. Although Ag-induced actin reorganization is known to be involved in BCR clustering in response to membrane-associated Ag, the underlying mechanism that links actin reorganization to BCR activation remains unknown. In this study, we show that both the stimulatory Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) and the inhibitory SHIP-1 are required for efficient BCR self-aggregation. In Btk-deficient B cells, the magnitude of BCR aggregation into clusters and B cell spreading in response to an Ag-tethered lipid bilayer is drastically reduced, compared with BCR aggregation observed in wild-type B cells. In SHIP-1\u2212\/\u2212 B cells, although surface BCRs aggregate into microclusters, the centripetal movement and growth of BCR clusters are inhibited, and B cell spreading is increased. The \u2026",
