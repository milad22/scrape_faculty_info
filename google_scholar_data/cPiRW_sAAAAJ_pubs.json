            "The response of living systems to nanoparticles is thought to depend on the protein corona, which forms shortly after exposure to physiological fluids and which is linked to a wide array of pathophysiologies. A mechanistic understanding of the dynamic interaction between proteins and nanoparticles and thus the biological fate of nanoparticles and associated proteins is, however, often missing mainly due to the inadequacies in current ensemble experimental approaches. Through the application of a variety of single molecule and single particle spectroscopic techniques in combination with ensemble level characterization tools, we identified different interaction pathways between gold nanorods and bovine serum albumin depending on the protein concentration. Overall, we found that local changes in protein concentration influence everything from cancer cell uptake to nanoparticle stability and even protein \u2026",

            "Chromatographic protein separations, immunoassays, and biosensing all typically involve the adsorption of proteins to surfaces decorated with charged, hydrophobic, or affinity ligands. Despite increasingly widespread use throughout the pharmaceutical industry, mechanistic detail about the interactions of proteins with individual chromatographic adsorbent sites is available only via inference from ensemble measurements such as binding isotherms, calorimetry, and chromatography. In this work, we present the direct superresolution mapping and kinetic characterization of functional sites on ion-exchange ligands based on agarose, a support matrix routinely used in protein chromatography. By quantifying the interactions of single proteins with individual charged ligands, we demonstrate that clusters of charges are necessary to create detectable adsorption sites and that even chemically identical ligands create \u2026",

We detect the step transitions using the Student\u2019s t test and group the segments into states by hierarchical clustering. The optimum number of states is determined based on the minimum description length equation. This method provides comprehensive, objective analysis of multiple traces requiring few user inputs about the underlying physical models and is faster and more precise in determining the number of states than established and cutting-edge methods for single-molecule data analysis. Perhaps most importantly, the method does not require either time-tagged photon counting or photon counting in general and thus can be applied to a broad range of experimental setups and analytes.",

Here, we present an investigation into the mechanism of this phenomenon using a single-molecule, super-resolution imaging technique called motion-blur Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (mbPAINT).

The target ssDNA molecules were immobilized on the substrate. Short, dye-labeled, and complementary ssDNA molecules stochastically bound to the target ssDNA, with repeated binding events allowing super-resolution. Sequence specificity was demonstrated via the use of a control, noncomplementary probe. The results support the possibility of employing relatively inexpensive short ssDNAs to identify gene sequence specificity with improved resolution in comparison to the existing methods.",
