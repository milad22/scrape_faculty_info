            "On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12: 41: 04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026",

            "Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II), SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations. This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Ly\u03b1 forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of large-scale structure to obtain percent \u2026",

            "Comprehensive wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys of the sky have played a key role in astronomy, leading to fundamental new breakthroughs in our understanding of the Solar System; our Milky Way Galaxy and its constituent stars and gas; the nature, properties, and evolution of galaxies; and the universe as a whole. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which started routine operations in 2000 April, has carried out imaging and spectroscopy over roughly 1\/3 of the Celestial Sphere. SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5 m wide-field telescope (Gunn et al. 2006), instrumented with a sequence of sophisticated imagers and spectrographs. The SDSS has gone through a series of stages. SDSS-I (York et al. 2000), which was in operation through 2005, focused on a \u201cLegacy\u201d survey of five-band imaging (using what was at the time the largest camera ever used in optical astronomy; Gunn et al. 1998) and \u2026",

It uses a dedicated wide-field 2.5 m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) at Apache Point Observatory (APO) in the Sacramento Mountains in Southern New Mexico. It was originally instrumented with a wide-field imaging camera with an effective area of 1.5 deg2 (Gunn et al. 1998), and a pair of double spectrographs fed by 640 fibers (Smee et al. 2013). The initial survey (York et al. 2000) carried out imaging in five broad bands (ugriz)(Fukugita et al. 1996) to a depth of r\u223c 22. 5 mag over 11,663 deg2 of high-latitude sky, and spectroscopy of 1.6 million galaxy, quasar, and stellar targets over 9380 deg2. The resulting images were calibrated astrometrically (Pier et al. 2003) and photometrically (Ivezic et al. 2004; Tucker et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2008), and the properties of the detected objects were measured (Lupton et al. 2001 \u2026",

            "The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project is a survey for planetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a small\u2010aperture, wide\u2010field automated telescope located at Winer Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The telescope surveys a set of 26\u00d7 26 fields that together cover about 25% of the northern sky, and targets stars in the range of 8< V< 10 mag, searching for transits by close\u2010in Jupiters. This paper describes the system hardware and software and discusses the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is able to achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary transits around solar\u2010type main\u2010sequence stars.",

These spectra were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in temperature estimates for stars with Teff< 5000 K and in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe\/H]>\u2212 0. 5.

This release incorporates the full extent of the data from the primary mission (Q0-Q17 Data Release). As a result, new systems have been added, additional false positives have been removed, ephemerides and principal parameters have been recomputed, classifications have been revised to rely on analytical models, and eclipse timing variations have been computed for each system. We identify several classes of systems including those that exhibit tertiary eclipse events, systems that show clear evidence of additional bodies, heartbeat systems, systems with changing eclipse depths, and systems exhibiting only one eclipse event over the duration of the mission.

From an initial list of nearly 13,400 threshold crossing events, 480 new host stars are identified from their flux time series as consistent with hosting transiting planets. Potential transit signals are subjected to further analysis using the pixel-level data, which allows background eclipsing binaries to be identified through small image position shifts during transit. We also re-evaluate Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) 1-1609, which were identified early in the mission, using substantially more data to test for background false positives and to find additional multiple systems. Combining the new and previous KOI samples, we provide updated parameters for 2738 Kepler planet candidates distributed across 2017 host stars. From the combined Kepler planet candidates, 472 are new from the Q1-Q8 \u2026",
