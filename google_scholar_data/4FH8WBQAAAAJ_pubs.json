Serum IgG4 elevation (in some patients) and tissue infiltration with IgG4-positive plasma cells (in essentially all patients)(1\u20133) are common threads that connect a variety of seemingly disparate conditions observed previously in multiple organs (4). A highly characteristic histopathology and immunohistochemical staining pattern are found in the involved organs (5\u20137).

Calorie restriction acts by reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst1) in Paneth cells\u2014an ectoenzyme that produces the paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose\u2014mediates the effects of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function.
