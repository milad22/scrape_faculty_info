            "The observation of electromagnetic radiation from radio to -ray wavelengths has provided a wealth of information about the universe. However, at PeV (10 eV) energies and above, most of the universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the most extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the universe. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes and environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2 is designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV energies; 2) Investigate cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger observations; 3) Reveal the sources and propagation of the highest energy particles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with high-energy neutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic neutrinos by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect sources five times fainter than its predecessor. Furthermore, through the addition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the energy range by several orders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years and cost about\\$350 M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033. IceCube-Gen2 will play an essential role in shaping the new era of multi-messenger astronomy, fundamentally \u2026",

            "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has established the existence of a high-energy all-sky neutrino flux of astrophysical origin. This discovery was made using events interacting within a fiducial region of the detector surrounded by an active veto and with reconstructed energy above 60 TeV, commonly known as the high-energy starting event sample, or HESE. We revisit the analysis of the HESE sample with an additional 4.5 years of data, newer glacial ice models, and improved systematics treatment. This paper describes the sample in detail, reports on the latest astrophysical neutrino flux measurements, and presents a source search for astrophysical neutrinos. We give the compatibility of these observations with specific isotropic flux models proposed in the literature as well as generic power-law-like scenarios. Assuming , and an equal flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos, we find that the astrophysical neutrino spectrum is compatible with an unbroken power law, with a preferred spectral index of  for the  confidence interval.",

The new measurement gives full coverage of the knee region of the spectrum and reduces the gap in energy between previous IceTop and direct measurements. With a new trigger that selects events in closely spaced detectors in the center of the array, the IceTop energy threshold is lowered by almost an order of magnitude below its previous threshold of 2 PeV. In this paper we explain how the new trigger is implemented, and we describe the new machine-learning method developed to deal with events with very few detectors hit.
