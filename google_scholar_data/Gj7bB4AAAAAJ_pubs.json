The pattern of [125I] TID incorporation into the M3 and M4 hydrophobic segments of each subunit was the same both in the presence and absence of the agonist carbamoylcholine and in the presence of an excess of nonradioactive TID, consistent with nonspecific photoincorporation from the lipid-protein interface.[125I] TID reacted with five residues in a-M4 [Blanton, M. P., & Cohen, JB (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3738-3750] but with only two or three residues in M4 segments of\/3-, y-, and 5-subunits. In 5-M3,[125I] TID reacted with Met-293, Ser-297, Gly-301, Val-304, and Asn-305 as well as with Ile-288 preceding M3 \u2026",

Spectroscopic and chemical labeling data indicate that the receptor in phosphatidylcholine alone is stabilized in a desensitized-like state, whereas the presence of either cholesterol or phosphatidic acid favors a resting-like conformation. Membranes that effectively stabilize a resting-like state exhibit a relatively large proportion of non-hydrogen-bonded lipid ester carbonyls, suggesting a relatively tight packing of the lipid head groups and thus a well ordered membrane. Functional reconstituted membranes also exhibit gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition \u2026",

[3H]Azicholesterol partitioned into nAChR-enriched membranes very efficiently (>98%), photoincorporated into nAChR subunits on an equal molar basis, and neither the pattern nor the extent of labeling was affected by the presence of the agonist carbamylcholine, consistent with photoincorporation at the nAChR lipid\u2212protein interface. Sites of [3H]Azicholesterol incorporation in each nAChR subunit were initially mapped by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion to two relatively large homologous fragments that contain either the transmembrane segments M1\u2212M2\u2212M3 (e.g., \u03b1V8\u221220) or M4 (e.g., \u03b1V8\u221210).

The topography of the pyrene-labeled Cys residues with respect to the membrane and the apparent affinity for representative lipids were determined by differential fluorescence quenching with spin-labeled derivatives of fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine, and the steroids cholestane and androstane.

Promegestone reversibly inhibited ACh-induced currents ofTorpedo AChRs expressed in Xenopusoocytes. Between 1\u201330 \u03bcM promegestone produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of the equilibrium binding affinity of [3H]ACh to Torpedo AChR-rich membranes. For AChRs in the presence of agonist (desensitized state) promegestone was a more potent inhibitor of the binding of the noncompetitive antagonist [3H]phencyclidine (IC50 = 9 \u03bcM) than of [3H]histrionicotoxin (IC50 \u223c 100 \u03bcM). To identify AChR domains in contact with the steroid, AChR-rich membranes equilibrated with [3H]promegestone were irradiated at 312 nm, and 3H-labeled amino acids were identified by amino-terminal sequencing of \u2026",
