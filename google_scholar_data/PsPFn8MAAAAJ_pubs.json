            "We present results of a study of neutrino oscillation based on a 766 ton\/year exposure of KamLAND to reactor antineutrinos. We observe 258 \u03bd e candidate events with energies above 3.4 MeV compared to 365.2\u00b123.7 events expected in the absence of neutrino oscillation. Accounting for 17.8\u00b17.3 expected background events, the statistical significance for reactor \u03bd e disappearance is 99.998%. The observed energy spectrum disagrees with the expected spectral shape in the absence of neutrino oscillation at 99.6% significance and prefers the distortion expected from \u03bd e oscillation effects. A two-neutrino oscillation analysis of the KamLAND data gives \u0394 m 2= 7.9\u2212 0.5+ 0.6\u00d7 10\u2212 5 e V 2.

Disagreements among recent Oklo determinations of the time evolution of \u03b1, the electromagnetic fine structure constant, are shown to be due to different reactor models, which led to different neutron spectra used in the calculations. We use known Oklo reactor epithermal spectral indices as criteria for selecting realistic reactor models. Two Oklo reactors, RZ2 and RZ10, were modeled with MCNP. The resulting neutron spectra were used to calculate the change in the Sm 149 effective neutron capture cross section as a function of a possible shift in the energy of the 97.3-meV resonance. We independently deduce ancient Sm 149 effective cross sections and use these values to set limits on the time variation of \u03b1. Our study resolves a contradictory situation with previous Oklo \u03b1 results. Our suggested 2 \u03c3 bound on a possible time \u2026",

Experiments have been carried out at the TUNL FN Tandem van de Graaff facility using the H 2 (d, n) He 3 reaction as a neutron source. Experimental methods and past results for neutron scattering from Li 6, Li 7, Be 9, B 10, B 11, C 12, C 13, and O 16 are summarized. Data have generally been accumulated at bombarding energies from 7 to 15 MeV in 1-MeV steps, at scattering angles from 25 to 160. Cross sections are compared to previous work. Much of the neutron scattering data is well described by the spherical optical model, particularly for nuclei in which resonance structure is not prominent. However, spherical optical model parameters for heavier nuclei do not reproduce the data well. Parameter sets for the individual nuclei are presented along with the \u2026",

Inelastic scattering to the first excited state in 54, 56Fe was also observed. For the 63, 65Cu isotopes, the inelastic cross sections for scattering to the combined group of the three (five) states were determined at 8 and 10 MeV (12 and 14 MeV). The elastic scattering data are compared to predictions of earlier global optical models. New spherical optical model representations were obtained. These data were combined with data for nickel, tin and lead to generate a new global parametrization. Comparisons of derived volume integrals for the potentials, total cross sections and potential radii are made to available information.",
