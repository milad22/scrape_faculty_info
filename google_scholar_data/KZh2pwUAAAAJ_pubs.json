We used nanofabricated diffraction holograms in an electron microscope to produce multiple electron vortex beams with well-defined topological charge. Beams carrying quantized amounts of orbital angular momentum (up to 100\u210f) per electron were observed. We describe how the electrons can exhibit such orbital motion in free space in the absence of any confining potential or external field, and discuss how these beams can be applied to improved electron microscopy of magnetic and biological specimens.",

Here we show that the spin-triplet supercurrent is enhanced up to 20 times after our samples are subject to a large in-plane field. This occurs because the synthetic antiferromagnet undergoes a \u201cspin-flop\u201d transition, whereby the two Co layer magnetizations end up nearly perpendicular to the magnetizations of the two thin F layers. We report direct experimental evidence for the spin-flop transition from scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis and from spin-polarized neutron reflectometry.

Here, we use the highly tunable magnetic properties of amorphous Fe\/Gd multilayer films to explore the magnetic properties that lead to dipole-stabilized skyrmions and skyrmion lattices that form from the competition of dipolar field and exchange energy. Using both real space imaging and reciprocal space scattering techniques, we determined the range of material properties and magnetic fields where skyrmions form. Micromagnetic modeling closely matches our observation of small skyrmion features (\u223c 50 to 70 nm) and suggests that these classes of skyrmions have a rich domain structure that is Bloch-like in the center of the film and more N\u00e9el-like towards each surface.

In this study, we introduce a scanning transmission electron microscopy technique combining a pre-specimen phase plate designed to produce a probe with structured phase with a high-speed direct electron detector to generate nearly linear contrast images with high efficiency. We demonstrate this method by using both experiment and simulation to simultaneously image the atomic-scale structure of weakly scattering amorphous carbon and strongly scattering gold nanoparticles. Our method demonstrates strong contrast for both materials, making it a promising candidate for structural determination of heterogeneous soft\/hard matter samples even at low electron doses comparable to traditional phase-contrast \u2026",

For example, diffraction gratings have been used to prepare electron beams with unique phase dislocations, such as electron vortex beams, which hold promise for the development of new imaging and spectroscopy techniques for the study of materials. However, beam intensity loss associated with absorption, scattering, and diffraction by a binary transmission grating drastically reduces the current in the beam, and thus the possible detected signal strength it may generate. Here we describe electron-transparent phase gratings that efficiently diffract transmitted electrons. These phase gratings produce electron beams with the high current necessary to generate detectable signal upon interaction with a material.

In the absence of coupling to an external electromagnetic field, the propagation of such vortex electron beams is virtually identical mathematically to that of vortex photon beams propagating in a medium with a homogeneous index of refraction. But when coupled to an external electromagnetic field, the propagation of vortex electron beams is distinctly different from photons. Here we use the exact path integral solution to Schrodinger's equation to examine the time evolution of an electron wave function carrying axial OAM.
