Despite predictions for the torque scaling as a power law of the Reynolds number, high-precision torque measurements reveal no Reynolds-number range with a fixed power law. A well-defined nonhysteretic transition at R= 1.3\u00d7 10 4 is marked by a change in the Reynolds-number dependence of the torque. Flow quantities such as the axial turbulent diffusivity, the time scales asociated with the fluctuations of the wall shear stress, and the root-mean-square fluctuations of the wall shear stress and its time derivative are all shown to be simply related to the global torque measurements. Above the transition, the torque measurements and observed time scales indicate a close correspondence between this closed-flow system and open-wall\u2013bounded-shear flows \u2026",
