            "Primitive path analyses of entanglements are performed over a wide range of chain lengths for both bead spring and atomistic polyethylene polymer melts. Estimators for the entanglement length N e which operate on results for a single chain length N are shown to produce systematic O (1\/N) errors. The mathematical roots of these errors are identified as (a) treating chain ends as entanglements and (b) neglecting non-Gaussian corrections to chain and primitive path dimensions. The prefactors for the O (1\/N) errors may be large; in general their magnitude depends both on the polymer model and the method used to obtain primitive paths. We propose, derive, and test new estimators which eliminate these systematic errors using information obtainable from the variation in entanglement characteristics with chain length. The new estimators produce accurate results for N e from marginally entangled systems. Formulas \u2026",

The dependence of strain hardening on strain and entanglement density is also consistent with these models, but the temperature dependence has the opposite trend. The dependence on temperature, rate, and interaction strength can instead be understood as reflecting changes in the flow stress.

The thermal component of stress is less sensitive to entanglements, mostly irreversible, and directly related to the rate of local plastic rearrangements.

While stress-strain curves for a wide range of temperature can be fit to the functional form predicted by entropic network models, many other results are fundamentally inconsistent with the physical picture underlying these models. Stresses are too large to be entropic and have the wrong trend with temperature. The most dramatic hardening at large strains reflects increases in energy as chains are pulled taut between entanglements rather than a change in entropy. A weak entropic stress is only observed in shape recovery of deformed samples when heated above the glass transition. While short chains do not form an entangled network, they exhibit partial shape recovery, orientation, and strain hardening.

To facilitate equilibration a Monte Carlo double-bridging algorithm is applied - new bonds are formed across a pair of chains, creating two new chains each substantially different from the original. For the long brush chains studied here, the structure of the brush assumes its large particle limit even for R as small as 8\u03c3, which is consistent with recent experimental findings and the small chain lattice simulations of Klos and Pakula.

Individual entanglements are identified using a modified version of primitive path analysis. Due to entropic collapse, the brushes embedded in the melt are more self-entangled than those in the implicit solvents. The self-entanglement of the brushes in the good and \u03d1 solvents as a function of coverage follows a simple scaling argument. We observe a depletion of entanglements near the systems' confining walls and offer several possible explanations. In the melt-embedded systems, the brushes entangle predominantly with the melt at low coverage and with themselves at high coverage. The peak of the brush\u2212melt entanglement density is highest at an intermediate coverage, but the integrated areal brush\u2212melt entanglement density continues to increase with coverage for the studied systems.
