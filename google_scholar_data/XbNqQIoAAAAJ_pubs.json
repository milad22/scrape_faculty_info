            "Diffusion in disordered systems does not follow the classical laws which describe transport in ordered crystalline media, and this leads to many anomalous physical properties. Since the application of percolation theory, the main advances in the understanding of these processes have come from fractal theory. Scaling theories and numerical simulations are important tools to describe diffusion processes (random walks: the \u2018ant in the labyrinth\u2019) on percolation systems and fractals. Different types of disordered systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion are presented (the incipient infinite percolation cluster, diffusion-limited aggregation clusters, lattice animals, and random combs), and scaling theories as well as numerical simulations of greater sophistication are described. Also, diffusion in the presence of singular distributions of transition rates is discussed and related to anomalous diffusion on disordered structures.",

Part II covers anomalous diffusion in fractals and disordered media, while Part III serves as an introduction to the kinetics of diffusion-limited reactions. Part IV discusses the problem of diffusion-limited coalescence in one dimension. This book will be of particular interest to researchers requiring a clear introduction to the field.

            "Many complex networks in nature have directed links, a property that affects the network\u2019s navigability and large-scale topology. Here we study the percolation properties of such directed scale-free networks with correlated in and out degree distributions. We derive a phase diagram that indicates the existence of three regimes, determined by the values of the degree exponents. In the first regime we regain the known directed percolation mean field exponents. In contrast, the second and third regimes are characterized by anomalous exponents, which we calculate analytically. In the third regime the network is resilient to random dilution, ie, the percolation threshold is p c\u2192 1.",

The embedding is driven by a natural constraint of minimization of the total length of the links in the system. We find that all networks with \u03bb> 2 can be successfully embedded up to a (Euclidean) distance \u03be which can be made as large as desired upon the changing of an external parameter. Clusters of successive chemical shells are found to be compact (the fractal dimension is d f= d), while the dimension of the shortest path between any two sites is smaller than 1: d m i n=(\u03bb\u2212 2)\/(\u03bb\u2212 1\u2212 1\/d), contrary to all other known examples of fractals and disordered lattices.",
