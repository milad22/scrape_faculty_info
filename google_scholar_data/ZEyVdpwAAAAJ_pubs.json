Besides the cuts, the poles and zeros on the different Riemann sheets determine the global behavior of the amplitude on the physical axis. Pole positions and residues allow for a parameterization of resonances in a well-defined way, free of assumptions for the background and energy dependence of the resonance part. This is a necessary condition to relate resonance contributions in different reactions. In the present study, we determine the pole structure of pion\u2013nucleon scattering in an analytic model based on meson exchange. For this, the sheet structure of the amplitude is determined.

Hence, the reaction provides useful information with which to test current theories of the dynamical generation of the low-lying 3\/2\u2212 states. The first reaction is shown to lead to sizable cross sections and the N*(1535) S 11 resonance shape is seen clearly in the \u03b7 p invariant mass distribution.

A method is proposed to perform such an extrapolation for three interacting particles at energies above threshold. For this, a recently formulated relativistic  amplitude based on the isobar formulation is adapted to the finite volume. The guiding principle is two- and three-body unitarity that imposes the imaginary parts of the amplitude in the infinite volume. In turn, these imaginary parts dictate the leading power-law finite-volume effects. It is demonstrated that finite-volume poles arising from the singular interaction, from the external two-body sub-amplitudes, and from the disconnected topology cancel exactly leaving only the genuine three-body eigenvalues. The corresponding quantization condition is derived for the case of three identical scalar-isoscalar particles and its \u2026",

It is shown that these reactions have peculiar features and act as filters for some quantum numbers which allow to identify easily some resonances and learn about their nature. The combination of basic elements of the weak interaction with the framework of the chiral unitary approach allow for an interpretation of results of many reactions and add a novel information to different aspects of the hadron interaction and the properties of dynamically generated resonances.",

After a fit to meson-meson partial wave data, lattice levels for \u03c0K scattering are predicted.
