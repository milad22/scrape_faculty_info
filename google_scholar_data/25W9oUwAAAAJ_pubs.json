It serves as an excellent realization of the Shastry\u2013Sutherland model, up to small anisotropies arising from Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interactions. Here we demonstrate that these anisotropies, in fact, give rise to topological character in the triplon band structure. The triplons form a new kind of Dirac cone with three bands touching at a single point, a spin-1 generalization of graphene. An applied magnetic field opens band gaps resulting in topological bands with Chern numbers\u00b12. SrCu 2 (BO 3) 2 thus provides a magnetic analogue of the integer quantum Hall effect and supports topologically protected edge modes. At a threshold value of the magnetic field set by the Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interactions, the three triplon bands touch once again in a spin-1 Dirac cone, and lose their topological character \u2026",

            "A promising route to tailoring the electronic properties of quantum materials and devices rests on the idea of orbital engineering in multilayered oxide heterostructures. Here we show that the interplay of interlayer charge imbalance and ligand distortions provides a knob for tuning the sequence of electronic levels even in intrinsically stacked oxides. We resolve in this regard the d-level structure of layered Sr 2 IrO 4 by electron spin resonance. While canonical ligand-field theory predicts g||-factors less than 2 for positive tetragonal distortions as present in Sr 2 IrO 4, the experiment indicates g|| is greater than 2. This implies that the iridium d levels are inverted with respect to their normal ordering. State-of-the-art electronic-structure calculations confirm the level switching in Sr 2 IrO 4, whereas we find them in Ba 2 IrO 4 to be instead normally ordered.

In the electron spin resonance and far infrared absorption spectra we found several spin excitations beyond the two conventional magnon modes expected for such a two-sublattice antiferromagnet. We show that a multiboson spin-wave theory describes these unconventional modes, including spin-stretching modes, characterized by an oscillating magnetic dipole and quadrupole moment. The lack of inversion symmetry allows each mode to become electric dipole active. We expect that the spin-stretching modes can be generally observed in inelastic neutron scattering and light absorption experiments in a broad class of ordered S> 1\/2 spin systems with strong single-ion anisotropy and\/or noncentrosymmetric lattice structure.",

We consider two cases: magnetic resonance (MR) with a misaligned, ie, nontransversal, driving field, and electrically driven spin resonance (EDSR) of an electron confined in a one-dimensional, parabolic quantum dot, subject to Rashba spin-orbit interaction. In the EDSR case, we focus on the limit where the orbital level spacing of the quantum dot is the greatest energy scale. Then, we apply time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory to derive a time-dependent effective two-level Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe both MR and EDSR using the Floquet theory of periodically driven two-level systems. In particular, we characterize the fundamental (single-photon) and the half-harmonic (two-photon) spin transitions. We demonstrate the appearance of two-photon Rabi oscillations, and analytically calculate \u2026",
