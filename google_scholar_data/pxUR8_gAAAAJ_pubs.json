            "There is general agreement that the MiSaTaQuWa equations should describe the motion of a'small body'in general relativity, taking into account the leading order self-force effects. However, previous derivations of these equations have made a number of ad hoc assumptions and\/or contain a number of unsatisfactory features. For example, all previous derivations have invoked, without proper justification, the step of'Lorenz gauge relaxation', wherein the linearized Einstein equation is written in the form appropriate to the Lorenz gauge, but the Lorenz gauge condition is then not imposed\u2014thereby making the resulting equations for the metric perturbation inequivalent to the linearized Einstein equations.(Such a'relaxation'of the linearized Einstein equations is essential in order to avoid the conclusion that'point particles' move on geodesics.)

In this limit, the charge, q, and total mass, m, of the body go to zero, and q\/m goes to a well-defined limit.

Such plasma is thought to play a key role in the physics of pulsars and active black holes. Despite its simple covariant formulation, FFE has primarily been studied in 3+1 frameworks, where spacetime is split into space and time. In this paper, we systematically develop the theory of force-free magnetospheres taking a spacetime perspective. Using a suite of spacetime tools and techniques (notably exterior calculus), we cover (1) the basics of the theory, (2) exact solutions that demonstrate the extraction and transport of the rotational energy of a compact object (in the case of a black hole, the Blandford\u2013Znajek mechanism), (3) the behaviour of current sheets, (4) the general theory of stationary, axisymmetric magnetospheres, and (5) general properties of pulsar and \u2026",

We clarify the meaning and relevance of these heuristics with analytic calculations and numerical toy models. The standard usage of the term \u201cshadow\u201d describes the appearance of a black hole illuminated from all directions, including from behind the observer. A backlit black hole casts a somewhat larger shadow. Neither \u201cshadow\u201d heuristic is particularly relevant to understanding the appearance of emission originating near the black hole, where the emission profile and gravitational redshift play the dominant roles in determining the observed size of the central dark area. A photon ring results from light rays that orbit around the black hole in the near-field region before escaping to infinity, where they arrive near a ring \u2026",

We confirm previous estimates of the overall scaling of the power radiated, but show that there are also small oscillations all the way to extremality. Furthermore, we reveal an intricate mode-by-mode structure in the flux to infinity, with only certain modes having the dominant scaling. The scaling of each mode is controlled by its conformal weight, a quantity that arises naturally in the representation theory of the enhanced near-horizon symmetry group.
