            "In this book, the authors provide a cogent review of statistical and interpretive procedures that, in combination, can be used to reduce the likelihood that tests contain items that favor members of one gender, age, racial, or ethnic group over equally able members of another group, for reasons that are unrelated to the objectives and purposes of measurement. Such test items are said to be biased against the equally able members of the group that is not favored. The methods described and illustrated in this book have the potential to reducing the incidence of tests that are, in their construction, biased against members of one or more groups. These methods have the potential of controlling an important source of invalidity when test results are interpreted.",

            "Background\/Context: There is much current interest in the impact of early childhood education programs on preschoolers and, in particular, on the magnitude of cognitive and affective gains. Purpose\/Objective\/Research Question\/Focus of Study: Because this new segment of public education may require substantial resources, accurate descriptions are required of the potential benefits and costs of implementing specific preschool programs. To address this issue comprehensively, a meta-analysis was conducted for the purpose of synthesizing the outcomes of comparative studies in this area. Population\/Participants\/Subjects: A total of 123 comparative studies of early childhood interventions were analyzed. Each study provided a number of contrasts, where a contrast is defined as the comparison of an intervention group of children with an alternative intervention or no intervention group.
