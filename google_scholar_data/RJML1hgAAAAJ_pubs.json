This is accomplished by exploiting either the inward or outward transverse acceleration associated with their chirped wavefronts. We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that such Airy beams morph into nondiffracting Bessel beams in their far-field. Furthermore, the ability of guiding and transporting microparticles along the primary rings of this class of beams is explored.",

            "Solitons, nonlinear self-trapped wavepackets, have been extensively studied in many and diverse branches of physics such as optics, plasmas, condensed matter physics, fluid mechanics, particle physics and even astrophysics. Interestingly, over the past two decades, the field of solitons and related nonlinear phenomena has been substantially advanced and enriched by research and discoveries in nonlinear optics. While optical solitons have been vigorously investigated in both spatial and temporal domains, it is now fair to say that much soliton research has been mainly driven by the work on optical spatial solitons. This is partly due to the fact that although temporal solitons as realized in fiber optic systems are fundamentally one-dimensional entities, the high dimensionality associated with their spatial counterparts has opened up altogether new scientific possibilities in soliton research. Another reason is related \u2026",
