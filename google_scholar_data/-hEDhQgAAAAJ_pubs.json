            "To determine whether APC function or \u201carming\u201d of CTL for lytic function are the points at which Ags from a nonimmunogenic tumor fail to induce an effective immune response, we established a murine tumor model that expressed intracellular OVA and selected a clone (cOVA-9) that remained susceptible to lysis by specific CD8+ T cells throughout tumor growth. Viable cOVA-9 tumor cells grew in normal mice at a rate similar to the parental tumor, and vaccination with irradiated cOVA-9 cells did not induce protection against itself or the parental line, confirming its nonimmunogenic status. In vivo evaluation during tumor growth demonstrated persisting tumor Ag cross-presentation accompanied by the generation of potent, specific CTL which were detectable when tumors were barely palpable. Despite the presence of highly active CTL in the tumor-draining lymph nodes, there was no apparent lysis of tumor-associated \u2026",

            "Treatment of lung cancer remains a challenge, and lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer\u2010related mortality. Immunotherapy has previously failed in lung cancer but has recently emerged as a very effective new therapy, and there is now growing worldwide enthusiasm in cancer immunotherapy. We summarize why immune checkpoint blockade therapies have generated efficacious and durable responses in clinical trials and why this has reignited interest in this field. Cancer vaccines have also been explored in the past with marginal success. Identification of optimal candidate neoantigens may improve cancer vaccine efficacy and may pave the way to personalized immunotherapy, alone or in combination with other immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade. Understanding the steps in immune recognition and eradication of cancer cells is vital to understanding why previous immunotherapies \u2026",

            "Most anticancer therapies including immunotherapies are given systemically; yet therapies given directly into tumors may be more effective, particularly those that overcome natural suppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment. The \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d approach of intratumoural delivery aims to promote immune-mediated destruction by inducing microenvironmental changes within the tumour at the same time as avoiding the systemic toxicity that is often associated with more \u201cfull frontal\u201d treatments such as transfer of large numbers of laboratory-expanded tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes or large intravenous doses of cytokine. Numerous studies have demonstrated that intratumoural therapy has the capacity to minimizing local suppression, inducing sufficient \u201cdangerous\u201d tumor cell death to cross-prime strong immune responses, and rending tumor blood vessels amenable to immune cell traffic to induce effector cell changes in secondary lymphoid organs. However, the key to its success is the design of a sound rational approach based on evidence. There is compelling preclinical data for local immunotherapy approaches in tumor immunology. This review summarises how immune events within a tumour can be modified by local approaches, how this can affect systemic antitumor immunity such that distal sites are attacked, and what approaches have been proven most successful so far in animals and patients.",

            "A key to improving cancer immunotherapy will be the identification of tumor-specific \u201cneoantigens\u201d that arise from mutations and augment the resultant host immune response. In this study we identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) by RNA sequencing of asbestos-induced murine mesothelioma cell lines AB1 and AB1-HA. Using the NetMHCpan 2.8 algorithm, the theoretical binding affinity of predicted peptides arising from high-confidence, exonic, non-synonymous SNVs was determined for the BALB\/c strain. The immunoreactivity to 20 candidate mutation-carrying peptides of increased affinity and the corresponding wild-type peptides was determined using interferon-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays and lymphoid organs of non-manipulated tumor-bearing mice. A strong endogenous immune response was demonstrated to one of the candidate neoantigens, Uqcrc2; this response was detected in the draining lymph node \u2026",
