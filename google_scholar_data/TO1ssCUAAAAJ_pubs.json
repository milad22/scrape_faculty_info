In the right-angle scattering geometry, the duration of the x-ray burst is determined by the transit time of the laser pulse across the \u223c 90-micrometer waist of the focused electron beam. The x-rays are highly directed (\u223c 0.6\u00b0 divergence) and can be tuned in energy. This source of femtosecond x-rays will make it possible to combine x-ray techniques with ultrafast time resolution to investigate structural dynamics in condensed matter.",

The radiation characteristics of an x-ray FEL, including its transverse coherence, temporal characteristics, and harmonic content, are discussed.

This process involves passing a high-energy, high-charge, short-pulse, low-energy-spread, and low-emittance electron beam through the periodic magnetic field of a long series of high-quality undulator magnets. The radiation produced grows exponentially in intensity until it reaches a saturation point. We report on the demonstration of self-amplified spontaneous emission gain, exponential growth, and saturation at visible (530 nanometers) and ultraviolet (385 nanometers) wavelengths. Good agreement between theory and simulation indicates that scaling to much shorter wavelengths may be possible. These results confirm the physics behind the self-amplified spontaneous emission process and forward the development of an operational x-ray free-electron laser.",

            "X rays produced by 90 Thomson scattering of a femtosecond, near infrared, terawatt laser pulse of a 50 MeV electron beam are shown to be an effective diagnostic to measure transverse and longitudinal density distributions of an electron beam (e beam) with subpicosecond time resolution. The laser beam was focused onto the e-beam waist, generating 30 keV x rays in the forward direction. The transverse and longitudinal e-beam structures have been obtained by measuring the intensity of the x-ray beam, while scanning the laser beam across the e beam in space and time. The e-beam divergence has been obtained through measurement of spatial and spectral characteristics of the scattered x-ray beam.",

The theory is based on the coupled Klimontovich-Maxwell equations. Formulas for the radiated power, spectral characteristics and electron correlations are derived. The saturation due to nonlinear effects is studied using a quasilinear extension of the theory. The results agree reasonably well with the recent Livermore experiment in the microwave range. Performance of a possible high-gain free electron laser in a short-wavelength region is evaluated.",

By including both one-stage and two-stage amplifications, we obtain analytical expressions for CSR microbunching that are valid in both low-gain and high-gain regimes. These formulas can be used to explore the dependence of CSR microbunching on compressed beam current, energy spread, and emittance, and to design stable bunch compressors required for an x-ray free-electron laser.",
