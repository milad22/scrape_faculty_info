            "Apoptosis is initiated when Bcl-2 and its prosurvival relatives are engaged by proapoptotic BH3-only proteins via interaction of its BH3 domain with a groove on the Bcl-2-like proteins. These interactions have been considered promiscuous, but our analysis of the affinity of eight BH3 peptides for five Bcl-2-like proteins has revealed that the interactions vary over 10,000-fold in affinity, and accordingly, only certain protein pairs associate inside cells. Bim and Puma potently engaged all the prosurvival proteins comparably. Bad, however, bound tightly to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w but only weakly to A1 and not to Mcl-1. Strikingly, Noxa bound only Mcl-1 and A1. In accord with their complementary binding, Bad and Noxa cooperated to induce potent killing. The results suggest that apoptosis relies on selective interactions between particular subsets of these proteins and that it should be feasible to discover BH3-mimetic \u2026",

            "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessively inherited autoinflammatory disorder with high carrier frequencies in the Middle East. Pyrin, the protein mutated in FMF, regulates caspase-1 activation and consequently IL-1\u03b2 production through cognate interaction of its N-terminal PYRIN motif with the ASC adaptor protein. However, the preponderance of mutations reside in pyrin\u2019s C-terminal B30.2 domain. Here we demonstrate direct interaction of this domain with caspase-1. In lysates from cells not expressing ASC, reciprocal GST pull-downs demonstrated the interaction of pyrin with the p20 and p10 catalytic subunits of caspase-1. Coimmunoprecipitations of pyrin and caspase-1 from THP-1 human monocytic cells were consistent with the interaction of endogenous proteins. The C-terminal B30.2 domain of pyrin is necessary and sufficient for the interaction, and binding was reduced by FMF-associated B30.2 \u2026",

Certain BH3-only relatives can directly activate them to mediate this pivotal, poorly understood step. To clarify the conformational changes that induce Bax oligomerization, we determined crystal structures of Bax\u0394C21 treated with detergents and BH3 peptides. The peptides bound the Bax canonical surface groove but, unlike their complexes with prosurvival relatives, dissociated Bax into two domains. The structures define the sequence signature of activator BH3 domains and reveal how they can activate Bax via its groove by favoring release of its BH3 domain. Furthermore, Bax helices \u03b12\u2013\u03b15 alone adopted a symmetric homodimer structure, supporting the proposal that two Bax molecules insert their BH3 domain into each other\u2019s surface groove to nucleate oligomerization \u2026",

Although there is controversy over how pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins function, 2, 3 it is generally agreed that apoptosis is initiated by the binding of the pro-death BH3-only proteins to the prosurvival molecules.

            "Background: Membrane fusion within the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses is mediated by a surface glycoprotein termed the \u201cF\u201d, or fusion, protein. Membrane fusion is assumed to involve a series of structural transitions of F from a metastable (prefusion) state to a highly stable (postfusion) state. No detail is available at the atomic level regarding the metastable form of these proteins or regarding the transitions accompanying fusion.Results: The three-dimensional structure of the fusion protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV-F) has been determined. The trimeric NDV-F molecule is organized into head, neck, and stalk regions. The head is comprised of a highly twisted \u03b2 domain and an additional immunoglobulin-like \u03b2 domain. The neck is formed by the C-terminal extension of the heptad repeat region HR-A, capped by a four-helical bundle. The C terminus of HR-A is encased by a further helix HR-C and a 4 \u2026",
