Here, we combined structured illumination microscopy with pharmacological and genetic perturbations, to study the process of actomyosin cytoskeleton self-organization into arcs and stress fibres. A striking feature of the myosin II filament organization was their \u2018registered\u2019alignment into stacks, spanning up to several micrometres in the direction orthogonal to the parallel actin bundles. While turnover of individual myosin II filaments was fast (characteristic half-life time 60 s) and independent of actin filament turnover, the process of stack formation lasted a longer time (in the range of several minutes) and required myosin II contractility, as well as actin filament assembly\/disassembly and crosslinking (dependent on formin Fmnl3, cofilin1 and \u03b1-actinin-4). Furthermore, myosin filament \u2026",

Colloids are ubiquitous in biological, chemical and technological processes 1, 2, homogenizing highly dissimilar constituents. To stabilize a colloidal system against coalescence and aggregation, the surface of each solute particle is engineered to impose repulsive forces strong enough to overpower van der Waals attraction and keep the particles separated from each other 2. Electrostatic stabilization 3, 4 of charged solutes works well in solvents with high dielectric constants, such as water (dielectric constant of 80). In contrast, colloidal stabilization in solvents with low polarity, such as hexane (dielectric constant of about 2), can be achieved by decorating the surface of each particle of the solute with molecules (surfactants) containing flexible, brush-like chains 2, 5.

Here, we show how this odd viscosity has a dramatic effect on topological sound waves in fluids, including the number and spatial profile of topological edge modes. Odd viscosity provides a short-distance cutoff that allows us to define a bulk topological invariant on a compact momentum space. As the sign of odd viscosity changes, a topological phase transition occurs without closing the bulk gap. Instead, at the transition point, the topological invariant becomes ill defined because momentum space cannot be compactified. This mechanism is unique to continuum models and can describe fluids ranging from electronic to chiral active systems.",

Here we demonstrate a liquid phase of actin filaments in the presence of the physiological cross-linker, filamin. Filamin condenses short actin filaments into spindle-shaped droplets, or tactoids, with shape dynamics consistent with a continuum model of anisotropic liquids. We find that cross-linker density controls the droplet shape and deformation timescales, consistent with a variable interfacial tension and viscosity. Near the liquid\u2013solid transition, cross-linked actin bundles show behaviors reminiscent of fluid threads, including capillary instabilities and contraction. These data reveal a liquid droplet phase of actin, demixed from the surrounding solution and dominated by interfacial tension.

Here we show theoretically how the substrate rigidity dependence of the registry data can be mapped onto that of the strain measurements. We express the elasticity-mediated structural registry as a phase-order parameter using a statistical physics approach that takes the noise and disorder inherent in biological systems into account. By assuming that structurally registered myofibrils also tend to beat in phase, we explain the observed dependence of both striation and strain measurements of cardiomyocytes on substrate stiffness in a unified manner. The agreement of our ideas with experiment suggests that the correlated beating of heart cells may be limited by the structural order of the myofibrils, which \u2026",

We consider two physically disparate systems: stochastic networks governed by microscopic single-particle dynamics, and collections of driven interacting particles described by coarse-grained hydrodynamic theory. We derive our results by mapping to well-known electronic models and exploiting the resulting correspondence between a bulk topological number and the spectrum of dissipative modes localized at the boundary. For the Markov networks, we report a general procedure to uncover the topological properties in terms of the transition rates. For the active fluid on a substrate, we introduce a topological interpretation of fluid dissipative modes at the edge.

In cross-striated muscle, myosin II (thick) filaments, actin (thin) filaments and elastic titin filaments comprise the stereotypical contractile units of muscles called sarcomeres. Linear chains of sarcomeres, called myofibrils, are aligned laterally in registry to form cross-striated muscle cells. The experimentally observed dependence of the registered organization of myofibrils on extracellular matrix elasticity has been proposed to arise from the interactions of sarcomeric contractile elements (considered as force dipoles) through the matrix. Non-muscle cells form small bipolar filaments built of less than 30 myosin II molecules. These filaments are associated in registry forming superstructures (\u2018stacks\u2019) orthogonal to actin filament bundles.
