            "To explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on small businesses, we conducted a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses between March 28 and April 4, 2020. Several themes emerged. First, mass layoffs and closures had already occurred\u2014just a few weeks into the crisis. Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than $10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the program, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties \u2026",

Despite this, intermediaries\u2014called outsourcing agencies\u2014have emerged in these markets. This article shows that agencies signal to employers that inexperienced workers are high quality. Workers affiliated with an agency have substantially higher job-finding probabilities and wages at the beginning of their careers compared to similar workers without an agency affiliation. This advantage declines after high-quality non-affiliated workers receive good public feedback scores. The results indicate that intermediaries have arisen endogenously to permit a more efficient allocation of workers to jobs.",

Despite oDesk minimizing many of the frictions that diaspora connections have traditionally overcome, diaspora connections still matter on oDesk, with ethnic Indians substantially more likely to choose a worker in India. This higher placement is the result of a greater likelihood of choosing India for the initial contract and substantial path dependence in location choices. We further examine wage and performance outcomes of outsourcing as a function of ethnic connections. Our examination of potential rationales for the greater ethnic-based placement of contracts assesses taste-based preferences and information differences.This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.",

            "In a cross-section of workers the median individual in self-employment earns less than the median paid worker, but the highest-paid entrepreneurs earn more than employees. Small business owners and others in self-employment have the option to transition back to paid work. If they are initially uncertain about their entrepreneurial abilities, this option increases the lifetime expected value of entering self-employment relative to the expected pay in a single year. This paper first documents that moves between paid work and self-employment are common and consistent with experimentation to learn about entrepreneurial ability. This motivates estimating the expected returns to entering self-employment within a dynamic lifecycle model allowing for non-random selection in and out of self-employment and gradual learning about entrepreneurial ability. The option value of returning to paid work is found to be a substantial part of the value of entering self-employment. Accounting for this option decreases the inferred non-pecuniary benefits of entrepreneurship necessary to reconcile observed earnings and workers\u2019 labor choices.\u2217 ewdillon@ asu. edu, christopher. t. stanton@ gmail. com.

            "The threat of COVID-19 has increased the health risks of going to an office or factory, leading more workers to do their jobs remotely. In this paper, we provide results from firm surveys on both small and large businesses on the prevalence and productivity of remote work, and expectations about the persistence of remote work once the COVID-19 crisis ends. We present four main findings. First, while overall levels of remote work are high, there is considerable variation across industries. The Dingel and Neiman (2020) measure of suitability for remote work does a remarkably good job of predicting the industry level patterns of remote work-highlighting the challenge of moving many industries to remote work. Second, remote work is much more common in industries with better educated and better paid workers. Third, in our larger survey, employers think that there has been less productivity loss from remote working in better educated and higher paid industries. Fourth, more than one-third of firms that had employees switch to remote work believe that remote work will remain more common at their company even after the COVID-19 crisis ends.",

            "Globalization has been a mighty force over the last few decades. Compared to the movements of material goods and financial capital across countries, however, labor and talent have been much slower to globalize. This greater localization of labor and talent is perhaps not surprising given that it is easier to transmit financial capital in a disembodied form or build\/ship a physical good for an exact purpose. People and their labor, however, have typically come as a collective and fully integrated package, so to speak, that makes location decisions more complex. If one seeks to access labor inputs available abroad, one option is to attract and host the individual, temporarily or permanently, near the location of the work to be performed. For a variety of reasons this has proven politically unpopular, and nearly all countries place restrictions on migrations. As a result, only about 3 percent of the world\u2019s population lives outside of their country of birth. 1 A second option is to identify how the required task can be exchanged",
