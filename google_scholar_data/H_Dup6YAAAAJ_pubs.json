            "The advent of spin transfer torque effect accommodates site-specific switching of magnetic nanostructures by current alone without magnetic field. However, the critical current density required for usual spin torque switching remains stubbornly high around 10 6\u201310 7 A cm\u2212 2. It would be fundamentally transformative if an electric field through a voltage could assist or accomplish the switching of ferromagnets. Here we report electric-field-assisted reversible switching in CoFeB\/MgO\/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions with interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, where the coercivity, the magnetic configuration and the tunnelling magnetoresistance can be manipulated by voltage pulses associated with much smaller current densities. These results represent a crucial step towards ultralow energy switching in magnetic tunnel junctions, and open a new avenue for exploring other voltage-controlled spintronic devices.",

We use patterned ferromagnetic thin film to demonstrate the profound effect of a substrate on the spin-dependent thermal transport. With different sample patterns and on varying the direction of temperature gradient, both longitudinal and transverse thermal voltages exhibit asymmetric instead of symmetric spin dependence. This unexpected behavior is due to an out-of-plane temperature gradient imposed by the thermal conduction through the substrate and the mixture of anomalous Nernst effects. Only with substrate-free samples have we determined the intrinsic spin-dependent thermal transport with characteristics and field sensitivity similar to those of the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect.",

The Co films can be reversibly changed from an optimally oxidized state with a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to a metallic state with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy or to an oxidized state with nearly zero magnetization, depending on the polarity and time duration of the applied electric fields. Consequently, an unprecedentedly large change of magnetic anisotropy energy up to 0.73 erg\/cm 2 has been realized in a nonvolatile manner using gate voltages of only a few volts.

After annealing samples at 300\u2009\u00b0C and higher, consistently better performance was obtained compared to that of conventional pMTJs with Ta layers. Large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) values were retained in a wide range of samples with Mo layers after annealing for 2 h at 400\u2009\u00b0C, in sharp contrast to the junctions with Ta layers, in which superparamagnetic behavior with nearly vanishing magnetoresistance was observed.

In this work, we show that voltage-controlled spintronic devices offer many attributes. Although a metallic ferromagnet responds only very weakly to an electric field if at all, under special circumstances an electric field can have a profound impact on its magnetic properties. An electric field can alter the interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of CoFeB\/MgO\/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in a prescribed manner. By exploiting the voltage dependence of the PMA we have accomplished voltage-controlled MTJ for which the high-and low-resistance states can be accessed reversibly and repeatedly by voltage pulses associated with very low current density in the range of 10 4 A cm\u2212 2.
