            "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic bioactive lipid mediator that promotes breast cancer progression by diverse mechanisms that remain somewhat unclear. Here we report pharmacologic evidence of a critical role for sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in producing S1P and mediating tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in a murine model of breast cancer metastasis. S1P levels increased both in the tumor and the circulation. In agreement, serum S1P levels were significantly elevated in stage IIIA human breast cancer patients, compared with age\/ethnicity-matched healthy volunteers. However, treatment with the specific SphK1 inhibitor SK1-I suppressed S1P levels, reduced metastases to lymph nodes and lungs, and decreased overall tumor burden of our murine model. Both S1P and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) stimulated hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro, whereas SK1-I \u2026",

Whereas for both estradiol (E2) and epidermal growth factor-activated SphK1 and production of S1P, only E2 stimulated rapid release of S1P and dihydro-S1P from MCF-7 cells. E2-induced S1P and dihydro-S1P export required estrogen receptor-\u03b1, not GPR30, and was suppressed either by pharmacological inhibitors or gene silencing of ABCC1 (multidrug resistant protein 1) or ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein).

            "Plasma membrane lipid composition must be maintained during growth and under environmental insult. In yeast, signaling mediated by TOR Complex 2 (TORC2)-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 controls lipid abundance and distribution in response to membrane stress. Ypk1, among other actions, alleviates negative regulation of L-serine:palmitoyl-CoA acyltransferase, upregulating production of long-chain base precursors to sphingolipids. To explore other roles for TORC2-Ypk1 signaling in membrane homeostasis, we devised a three-tiered genome-wide screen to identify additional Ypk1 substrates, which pinpointed both catalytic subunits of the ceramide synthase complex. Ypk1-dependent phosphorylation of both proteins increased upon either sphingolipid depletion or heat shock and was important for cell survival. Sphingolipidomics, other biochemical measurements and genetic analysis demonstrated that these modifications of ceramide synthase increased its specific activity and stimulated channeling of long-chain base precursors into sphingolipid end-products. Control at this branch point also prevents accumulation of intermediates that could compromise cell growth by stimulating autophagy.DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.03779.001",

Recently, there has been growing evidence that tumor lymphangiogenesis (formation of new lymphatic vessels) plays an important role in this process. Here, we review the latest findings of the role of lymphangiogenesis in colorectal cancer progression, and discuss its clinical application as a biomarker and target for new therapy. Understanding the molecular pathways that regulate lymphangiogenesis is mandatory to pave the way for the development of new therapies for cancer. In the future, tailored treatments consisting of combinations of chemotherapy, other targeted therapies, and anti-lymphangiogenesis agents will hopefully improve patient outcomes. This progression to the clinic must be guided by new avenues of research, such as the identification of biomarkers that predict \u2026",
