A total of about 3\u00d7 10 5 (K\u2212, K+) events were collected and analyzed. \u039e hypernuclear states are expected to be produced through the reaction K\u2212+ 12 C\u2192 K++ \u039e 12 Be.

The measured missing-mass spectrum indicates the existence of a signal below the threshold for free \u039e\u2212 production that cannot be explained by background or effects of limited resolution. Although the resolution was not sufficient to resolve discrete hypernuclear states, the excess of events in the region of missing mass, kinematically inaccessible in free \u039e\u2212 production, can be compared with theoretical predictions for \u039e 12 Be production \u2026",

            "An experiment demonstrating the production of double-\u039b hypernuclei in (K\u2212, K+) reactions on 9 Be was carried out at the D6 line in the BNL alternating-gradient synchrotron. The technique was the observation of pions produced in sequential mesonic weak decay, each pion associated with one unit of strangeness change. The results indicate the production of a significant number of the double hypernucleus \u039b \u039b 4 H and the twin hypernuclei \u039b 4 H and \u039b 3 H. The relevant decay chains are discussed and a simple model of the production mechanism is presented. An implication of this experiment is that the existence of an S=\u2212 2 dibaryon more than a few MeV below the \u039b \u039b mass is unlikely.",

Here the experimental error includes PREX statistical and systematic errors, while the model error describes the uncertainty in R W from uncertainties in the surface thickness \u03c3 of the weak charge density. The weak radius is larger than the charge radius, implying a \u201cweak charge skin\u201d where the surface region is relatively enriched in weak charges compared to (electromagnetic \u2026",

The results of the experiment\u2019s commissioning run, constituting approximately 4% of the data collected in the experiment, are reported here. From these initial results, the measured asymmetry is A e p=\u2212 279\u00b135 (stat)\u00b131 (syst) ppb, which is the smallest and most precise asymmetry ever measured in e\u2192 p scattering. The small Q 2 of this experiment has made possible the first determination of the weak charge of the proton Q W p by incorporating earlier parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) data at higher Q 2 to constrain hadronic corrections. The value of Q W p obtained in this way is Q W p (PVES)= 0.064\u00b10.012, which is in good agreement with the standard model \u2026",
