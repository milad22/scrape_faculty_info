            "Thirteen families have been described with an autosomal dominantly inherited dementia named frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, historically termed Pick's disease 10. Most FTDP-17 cases show neuronal and\/or glial inclusions that stain positively with antibodies raised against the microtubule-associated protein Tau, although the Tau pathology varies considerably in both its quantity (or severity) and characteristics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12. Previous studies have mapped the FTDP-17 locus to a 2-centimorgan region on chromosome 17q21. 11; the tau gene also lies within this region. We have now sequenced tau in FTDP-17 families and identified three missense mutations (G272V, P301L and R406W) and three mutations in the 5\u2032 splice site of exon 10. The splice-site mutations all destabilize a potential stem\u2013loop structure which is probably \u2026",

            "The chromosome 9p21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) locus contains one of the last major unidentified autosomal-dominant genes underlying these common neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause.

A large proportion of FTD patients (35\u201350%) have a family history of dementia, consistent with a strong genetic component to the disease 2. In 1998, mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) were shown to cause familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17q21 (FTDP-17) 3. The neuropathology of patients with defined MAPT mutations is characterized by cytoplasmic neurofibrillary inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau 3, 4. However, in multiple FTD families with significant evidence for linkage to the same region on chromosome 17q21 (D17S1787\u2013D17S806), mutations in MAPT have not been found and the patients consistently lack tau-immunoreactive inclusion pathology 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

            "The identification of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene as the cause of chromosome 9-linked frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease offers the opportunity for greater understanding of the relationship between these disorders and other clinical forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In this study, we screened a cohort of 398 patients with frontotemporal dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia, semantic dementia or mixture of these syndromes for mutations in the C9ORF72 gene. Motor neuron disease was present in 55 patients (14%). We identified 32 patients with C9ORF72 mutations, representing 8% of the cohort. The patients\u2019 clinical phenotype at presentation varied: nine patients had frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease, 19 had frontotemporal dementia alone, one had mixed semantic dementia with frontal features and three had progressive non \u2026",

            "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a movement disorder with prominent tau neuropathology. Brain diseases with abnormal tau deposits are called tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease. Environmental causes of tauopathies include repetitive head trauma associated with some sports. To identify common genetic variation contributing to risk for tauopathies, we carried out a genome-wide association study of 1,114 individuals with PSP (cases) and 3,247 controls (stage 1) followed by a second stage in which we genotyped 1,051 cases and 3,560 controls for the stage 1 SNPs that yielded P\u2264 10\u2212 3. We found significant previously unidentified signals (P< 5\u00d7 10\u2212 8) associated with PSP risk at STX6, EIF2AK3 and MOBP. We confirmed two independent variants in MAPT affecting risk for PSP, one of which influences MAPT brain expression. The genes implicated encode proteins for vesicle \u2026",

            "Objective:  To analyze the association of polymorphisms in the tau gene with pathologically confirmed corticobasal degeneration (CBD).Background:  The authors previously described an extended tau haplotype (H1) that covers the human tau gene and is associated with the development of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The authors now extend this analysis to CBD, a neurodegenerative condition with clinical and neuropathologic similarities to PSP. Like PSP, CBD is associated with accumulation of aggregates containing the 4-repeat isoforms of tau. Because of difficulty in diagnosis of CBD, the authors only analyzed cases with pathologically confirmed CBD.Methods:  The authors collected 57 unrelated, neuropathologically confirmed cases of CBD. Tau sequencing in these cases failed to show the presence of pathogenic mutations. Polymorphisms that spanned the tau gene were analyzed in all CBD \u2026",
