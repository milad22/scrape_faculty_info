            "In this paper we study the effect of well-known higher-order corrections to the allowed \u03b2-decay spectrum on the determination of antineutrino spectra resulting from the decays of fission fragments. In particular, we try to estimate the associated theory errors and find that induced currents like weak magnetism may ultimately limit our ability to improve the current accuracy and under certain circumstance could even greatly increase the theoretical errors. We also perform a critical evaluation of the errors associated with our method to extract the antineutrino spectrum using synthetic \u03b2 spectra. It turns out that a fit using only virtual \u03b2 branches with a judicious choice of the effective nuclear charge provides results with a minimal bias. We apply this method to actual data for 235 U, 239 Pu, and 241 Pu and confirm, within errors, recent results, which indicate a net 3% upward shift in energy-averaged antineutrino fluxes \u2026",

One part of the software is the abstract experiment definition language to define experiments with beam and full detector descriptions as accurately as possible. Many systematics options are provided, such as normalization and energy calibration errors, or the choice between spectral or total rate information. For the definition of experiments, a new transparent building block concept is introduced. In addition, an additional program provides the possibility to develop and test new experiment definitions quickly. Another part of GLoBES is the user's interface, which provides probability, rate, and \u0394 \u03c7 2 information for a given experiment or any combination of up to 32 experiments in C.

In addition, the combination with external information, such as from different experiment classes, is simplified. As far as the probability calculation is concerned, GLoBES now provides an interface for the inclusion of non-standard physics without re-compilation of the software. The set of experiment prototypes coming with GLoBES has been updated. For example, built-in fluxes are now provided for the simulation of beta beams.",

Especially, degeneracies have so far not been taken into account in a numerical analysis. We furthermore include external input, such as improved knowledge of the solar oscillation parameters from the KamLAND experiment. This allows us to determine the limiting uncertainties in all cases. For a specific comparison, we choose two representatives of each class: for the superbeam, we take the first conceivable setup, namely, the JHF to SuperKamiokande experiment, as well as, on a longer time scale, the JHF to HyperKamiokande experiment.

            "We report a new measurement of electron antineutrino disappearance using the fully constructed Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. The final two of eight antineutrino detectors were installed in the summer of 2012. Including the 404 days of data collected from October 2012 to November 2013 resulted in a total exposure of 6.9\u00d7 10 5 GW th ton days, a 3.6 times increase over our previous results. Improvements in energy calibration limited variations between detectors to 0.2%. Removal of six Am 241\u2212 C 13 radioactive calibration sources reduced the background by a factor of 2 for the detectors in the experimental hall furthest from the reactors. Direct prediction of the antineutrino signal in the far detectors based on the measurements in the near detectors explicitly minimized the dependence of the measurement on models of reactor antineutrino emission.

            "We present a detailed quantitative discussion of the measurement of the leptonic mixing angle sin22\u03b813 with a future reactor neutrino oscillation experiment consisting of a near and far detector. We perform a thorough analysis of the impact of various systematical errors and compare the resulting physics potential to the one of planned first-generation superbeam experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the complementarity of both types of experiments. We find that, under realistic assumptions, a determination of sin22\u03b813 down to 10\u22122 is possible with reactor experiments. They are thus highly competitive to first-generation superbeams and may be able to test sin22\u03b813 on shorter timescales. In addition, we find that the combination of a KamLAND-size reactor experiment with one or two superbeams could substantially improve the ability to access the neutrino mass hierarchy or the leptonic CP phase.",
