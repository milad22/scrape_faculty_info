            "This paper reviews energy harvesting technology from mechanical vibration. Recent advances on ultralow power portable electronic devices and wireless sensor network require limitless battery life for better performance. People searched for permanent portable power sources for advanced electronic devices. Energy is everywhere around us and the most important part in energy harvesting is energy transducer. Piezoelectric materials have high energy conversion ability from mechanical vibration. A great amount of researches have been conducted to develop simple and efficient energy harvesting devices from vibration by using piezoelectric materials. Representative piezoelectric materials can be categorized into piezoceramics and piezopolymers. This paper reviews key ideas and performances of the reported piezoelectric energy harvesting from vibration. Various types of vibration devices \u2026",

            "Cellulose, the chain of glucose residues easily obtained from nature, is the most common natural polymer. Owing to its own unique material properties, compared to the conventional usage, nanocellulose (NC) with a crystalline structure can be considered to be used in various industrial applications. As a novel sustainable future material, we review the recent achievements of NC from the view point of material extraction and the composite processes to some extended important applications. While the mechanical properties of NCs and the energy consumption during their composite processing are the key considerations, their application potentials have never been limited to mechanical or commodity products as conventional celluloses. In the latter part of this review, emerging engineering applications of NCs such as energy storage, flexible electronics, and smart materials will be further discussed for \u2026",

MWCNT bonded to cellulose chains can act as electron channel paths in dielectric cellulose layers. It is found that the covalent bonding between cellulose and MWCNT can be modulated by reaction time and temperature. The RC-MWCNT paper transistor shows that the leakage current and the on\/off ratio are strongly associated with the concentration of MWCNTs. The estimated electron mobility of RC-MWCNT paper is comparable to other organic transistor materials. The RC-MWCNT paper transistor has a potential for flexible electronic paper.",

            "Piezoelectricity is one major actuating mechanism of cellulose-based electro-active paper (EAPap). In order to increase the piezoelectricity of EAPap, wet drawing method with different stretching conditions was introduced in the fabrication process of cellulose film. Structural and mechanical characterizations of wet drawn and stretched cellulose film were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high voltage electron microscope (HVEM) and mechanical pulling test setup. From the piezoelectric charge constant measurement, it was revealed that the performance of EAPap was sensitive to the drawing ratio of cellulose film and its material orientation. We found that optimized alignment direction along the cellulose fibers and drawing ratio during wet drawing process were very critical parameters to improve electro-mechanical properties of EAPap. Also we conclude that the simple wet \u2026",
