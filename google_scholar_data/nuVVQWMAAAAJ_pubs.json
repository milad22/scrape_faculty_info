We focus on plasmas in which \u03b2 lesssim 1, where \u03b2 is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure. As in previous studies, we find that when the turbulence amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, an ion's orbit becomes chaotic. The ion then interacts stochastically with the time-varying electrostatic potential, and the ion's energy undergoes a random walk. Using phenomenological arguments, we derive an analytic expression for the rates at which different ion species are heated, which we test by simulating test particles interacting with a spectrum of randomly phased AWs and KAWs. We find that the stochastic heating rate depends sensitively on the \u2026",

            "A number of studies suggest that turbulent heating plays an important role in the thermal balance of galaxy\u2010cluster plasmas. In this paper, we construct a model of intracluster plasmas in which radiative cooling is balanced by heating from viscous dissipation of turbulent motions, turbulent diffusion of high\u2013specific\u2010entropy plasma into low\u2013specific\u2010entropy regions, and thermal conduction. We solve for the rms turbulent velocity u by setting   throughout a cluster, where \u0393, Q, and H are the heating rates from dissipation of turbulence, turbulent diffusion, and conduction, respectively, and R is the rate of radiative cooling. We account for the effects of buoyancy in our expression for the eddy diffusivity and neglect nonthermal pressure. We take the conductivity to be a fixed fraction (typically one\u2010fifth) of the Spitzer value for a nonmagnetized plasma and the density and temperature to be given by analytical fits to published \u2026",
