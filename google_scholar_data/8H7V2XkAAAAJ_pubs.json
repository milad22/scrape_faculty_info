A profile-likelihood analysis technique shows our data to be consistent with the background-only hypothesis, allowing 90% confidence limits to be set on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering with a minimum upper limit on the cross section of 7.6\u00d7 1 0\u2212 46 cm 2 at a WIMP mass of 33 GeV\/c 2.

It covers historical, current, and future experiments that look for direct evidence of particle DM. In addition, it surveys the underlying particle theories that provide some guidance about expected event rates, and the future prospects for the discovery of DM. A number of recent theoretical papers, making calculations in SUSY-based frameworks, show a spread of many (>5) orders of magnitude in the possible interaction rates for models consistent with existing cosmological and accelerator bounds. Within this decade, it seems likely that DM searches will be successful, or at the very least rule out a broad class of the currently most favored DM models.",

            "The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) collaboration has designed and constructed a dual-phase xenon detector, in order to conduct a search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a leading dark matter candidate. The goal of the LUX detector is to clearly detect (or exclude) WIMPS with a spin independent cross-section per nucleon of 2\u00d7 10\u2212 46 cm 2, equivalent to\u223c 1 event\/100 kg\/month in the inner 100-kg fiducial volume (FV) of the 370-kg detector. The overall background goals are set to have< 1 background events characterized as possible WIMPs in the FV in 300 days of running. This paper describes the design and construction of the LUX detector.",
