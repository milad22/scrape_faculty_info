            "The Deep Web, i.e., content hidden behind HTML forms, has long been acknowledged as a significant gap in search engine coverage. Since it represents a large portion of the structured data on the Web, accessing Deep-Web content has been a long-standing challenge for the database community. This paper describes a system for surfacing Deep-Web content, i.e., pre-computing submissions for each HTML form and adding the resulting HTML pages into a search engine index. The results of our surfacing have been incorporated into the Google search engine and today drive more than a thousand queries per second to Deep-Web content.Surfacing the Deep Web poses several challenges. First, our goal is to index the content behind many millions of HTML forms that span many languages and hundreds of domains. This necessitates an approach that is completely automatic, highly scalable, and very efficient \u2026",

Many MapReduce jobs are I\/O-bound, and so minimizing the number of I\/O operations is critical to improving their performance. In this work, we present Themis, a MapReduce implementation that reads and writes data records to disk exactly twice, which is the minimum amount possible for data sets that cannot fit in memory.",

We believe the work holds a number of lessons for balanced system design and for scale-out architectures in general. While many interesting systems are able to scale linearly with additional servers, per-server performance can lag behind per-server capacity by more than an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between high scalability and high performance would enable either significantly cheaper systems that are able to do the same work or provide the ability to address significantly larger problem sets with the same infrastructure.",

            "Emerging cloud-based network services must deliver both good performance and high availability. Achieving both of these goals requires content replication across multiple sites. Many cloud-based services either require or would benefit from the semantics and simplicity of strong consistency. However, replication techniques for strong consistency can severely limit the availability of replicated services when recovering large data objects over wide-area links. To address this problem, we present the design and implementation of ZORFU, a hierarchical system architecture for replication across data centers. The primary contribution of ZORFU is a local recovery technique that significantly increases availability of replicated strongly consistent services. Local recovery achieves this by reducing the recovery time by an order of magnitude, while imposing only a negligible latency overhead. Experimental results show that \u2026",
