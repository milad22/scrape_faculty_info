A simple relationship between the intralaminar fracture toughness at the specimen level of a cross ply and its constituent sub-laminates is presented. Test data for fracture loads and crack-opening displacements at the opposite end (far end) to the crack tip of the three types of C(T) specimens are obtained.

The behaviour of the composite material under thermal, thermo-chemical and mechanical loads is studied. A general approach to carry out thermo-structural analysis and how the behaviour is incorporated in the modelling are briefly discussed. Thermo-structural analysis shows that thermal stresses are very much predominant when compared to stresses due to mechanical loads. A parametric study on variation of coefficient of thermal expansion (\u03b1) due to change in fibre orientation of carbon\u2013carbon cap type structure is studied and it is concluded that one of the critical design variables identified is the \u03b1 value across the thickness of the laminate.",

Minimizing the stress concentration around these holes is an important consideration in engineering design. One of the methods to minimize the stress concentration is to change the hole shape itself until the optimized shape with minimum stress concentration factor (s.c.f.) is reached within specified geometric constraints and loading condition. In the present note, using conformal transformation technique, centrally located quasi\u2010square holes in isotropic beams under pure bending are analyzed. It is well\u2010known that for circular hole with  there will be no stress concentration and hence the hole does not weaken the beams. The present study shows that with the optimized quasi\u2010square hole shapes, holes as large as  can be introduced without producing any \u2026",

The input parameters for the analysis are interfacial bond strength, mode I and mode II interfacial fracture toughness values, obtained from flatwise tension tests, drum-peel tests and three-point end notch flexure tests, respectively. Debonded honeycomb specimens are tested and the acoustic emission technique was used to observe the initiation of the debond growth. The load-displacement response from the cohesive zone model model shows a good agreement with the experimental results. The conventional analysis without cohesive zone model overestimates failure load by 56%.

The design of the TPS depends on the type of reentry (such as lifting body or ballistic), trajectory, duration of flight in the atmospheric regime, and maximum heat flux. Some types of passive TPSs such as silica tile need to be replaced or refurbished between flights. One of the most critical needs in the space industry is to reduce the cost of access to space. Different concepts of metallic thermal protection systems (MTPSs)(Fig. 1) for protecting reentry vehicles have been conceived and tried [1\u20137]. When compared to conventional TPSs such as silica tile, MTPSs have several advantages, even though it has a higher density. MTPSs can be considered reliable structures that can be tailored effectively to bear both thermal and structural loads \u2026",

The strain-energy release rate is evaluated for fibre orientations of 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 and compared with the fracture toughness (available in literature) and thus the fracture loads (crack initition loads) obtained.

It was shown that spatial fi lters can introduce a no-phase delay low-pass fi lter by offering a weighting function with the prechosen surface electrode, and the introduction of this odd function brings a differentiation to the transfer function. The method of imaging was introduced to extend the spatial fi lter application area from a fi nite structure to an infi nite domain, that is, spatial fi lters can now be placed near or even at the boundaries. Benefi ts associated with adopting spatial fi lters to point sensors successfully demonstrate theoretically as well as experimentally the advantages of the newly developed rotational acceleration rate sensor.
