The results showed that dairy cows with ketosis exhibited oxidative stress and liver damage, which was significantly correlated with plasma BHB. Similarly, high concentrations of BHB increased the oxidative stress of cow hepatocytes in vitro, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which led to increased expression, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity of p53 and decreased Nrf2 in bovine hepatocytes \u2026",
