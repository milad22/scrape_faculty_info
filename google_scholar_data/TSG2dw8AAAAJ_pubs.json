This is in large part due to the fact that the star formation process happens very quickly and in regions of the Galaxy that are difficult to study observationally. We review the theoretical models that have been developed in an effort to explain how binaries form. Several proposed mechanisms appear to be quite promising, but none is completely satisfactory.",

We consider two merger scenarios: one where the stars have aligned poloidal magnetic fields and one without. Both mergers result in a strongly differentially rotating object. In comparison to the nonmagnetized scenario, the aligned magnetic fields delay the full merger of the stars. During and after merger we observe phenomena driven by the magnetic field, including Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in shear layers, winding of the field lines, and transition from poloidal to toroidal magnetic fields. These effects not only mediate the production of electromagnetic radiation, but also can have a strong influence on the gravitational waves. Thus, there are promising prospects for studying such systems with both types of waves.",

In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar systems and the m= 2 I-modes in gaseous systems have many common physical characteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy of the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in stellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability criterion. The new stability parameter\" alpha\" is formulated first for uniformly rotating systems and is based on the angular momentum content rather than on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems\" alpha\"= 0.254-0.258, while it is in the range of 0.341-0.354 for gaseous systems. For uniform rotation, one can write\" alpha\" as a function of the total (rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is characteristic of the topology\/connectedness and the geometric shape of a system.\" Alpha\" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of differentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal models whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known. We also estimate\" alpha\" for gaseous toroidal models and for stellar disk systems embedded in an inert or responsive\" halo\". We find that the new stability criterion holds equally well for all these previously published axisymmetric models.",
