            "A brief overview on the preparation and properties of resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde organic and carbon gels reveals very interesting features about their structural and performance characteristics. The resulting nanostructure was very sensitive to the various synthesis and processing conditions. This leads to a remarkable potential for designing and tailoring these materials to fit specific applications. Based on step\u2010by\u2010step comparisons of the published studies, approximate generalizations on the specific roles the synthesis and processing conditions play on the final properties are provided. Overall, resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde organic gels undergo two main stages during synthesis. The first stage is associated with the preparation of the sol mixture, and the subsequent gelation and curing of the gel. The second stage is associated with the drying of the wet gel. The most important factors that affect the properties of the \u2026",

The effect of thermal treatment on the surface area, pore volume, crystallinity, particle structure, and corresponding electrochemical properties of the resulting xerogels was investigated and found to have significant effects on all of these properties. The xerogel remained amorphous as up to 160 C, and exhibited maxima in both the surface area and pore volume at this temperature. With an increase in the temperature above 200 C, both the surface area and pore volume decreased sharply, because the amorphous decomposed to form CoO that was subsequently oxidized to form crystalline. In addition, the changes in the surface area, pore volume, crystallinity, and particle structure all had significant but coupled effects on the electrochemical properties of the xerogels.

The effect of the initial pH of the RF solution on the surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution and nanostructure was studied. A brief mechanism of polymerization is discussed. Typically, a lower initial pH yielded carbon xerogels with a higher surface area and pore volume, and a broader pore size distribution. The highest surface area and pore volume were around 620 m2 g\u22121 and 0.8 cm3 g\u22121, with a mean pore radius ranging from 4 to 6 nm and with 80% of the pore volume as mesopores.

Hence, energy efficient, CO2 separation technologies with improved economics are needed for industrial processing and for future options to capture and concentrate CO2 for reuse or sequestration.

Increasing the carbonization temperature caused a decrease in the number of micropores in the 6 \u00c5 range but had little effect on the mesopore size distribution and thus mesopore cumulative surface area. Increasing the activation time caused an increase in the number of both micro\u2010and mesopores where pores in the 6 \u00c5 width range eventually became pores in the 12 \u00c5 width range.

            "This review on the use of adsorption and membrane technologies in H2 production is directed toward the chemical and petrochemical industries. The growing requirements for H2 in chemical manufacturing, petroleum refining, and the newly emerging clean energy concepts will place greater demands on sourcing, production capacity and supplies of H2. Currently, about 41 MM tons\/yr of H2 is produced worldwide, with 80% of it being produced from natural gas by steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal reforming. H2 is used commercially to produce CO, syngas, ammonia, methanol, and higher alcohols, urea and hydrochloric acid. It is also used in Fischer Tropsch reactions, as a reducing agent (metallurgy), and to upgrade petroleum products and oils (hydrogenation).It has been estimated that the reforming of natural gas to produce H2 consumes about 31,800 Btu\/lb of H2 produced at 331 psig based \u2026",

            "President Bush, during his State of the Union Address this year, pronounced a $1.2 billion jump-start to the hydrogen economy. The move would represent not only freedom from US-dependence on foreign oil, which is a national security issue, but also a necessary and gargantuan step toward improving the environment by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. However, hydrogen storage is proving to be one of the most important issues and potentially biggest roadblock for the implementation of a hydrogen economy. Of the three options that exist for storing hydrogen, in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state, the former is becoming accepted as the only method potentially able to meet the gravimetric and volumetric densities of the recently announced FreedomCar goals; and of all known hydrogen storage materials, complex hydrides may be the only hope.In recent years, months, weeks \u2026",
