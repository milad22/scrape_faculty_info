Like diamond, this new phase could potentially be synthesized at high pressure and quenched to ambient pressure for use as a superhard material. The calculations also predict that \u03b1-C3N4 and graphite-C3N4 are energetically favored relative to \u03b2-C3N4 and that published diffraction data can be re-indexed as \u03b1-C3N4 with lower error.",

The clathrate cages are multiply occupied, with a cluster of two H2 molecules in the small cage and four in the large cage. Substantial softening and splitting of hydrogen vibrons indicate increased intermolecular interactions. The quenched clathrate is stable up to 145 kelvin at ambient pressure.

            "In recent years, important advances in our understanding of the pressure-temperature phase and transformation diagram for carbon have occurred as a result of developments in both experimental and theoretical techniques. Graphite, diamond, liquid and vapor remain the major thermodynamically stable forms of carbon. However, due to the high activation energies for solid-state transformations and the specific effects of reaction paths, other metastable forms and a wide spectrum of complex hybrid forms may be generated, and possibly quenchedin, to survive metastably. This paper focuses primarily on developments since the last review of the carbon phase diagram published in 1989, but also includes references to the reliable older work. Some of the newer conclusions include the following: the Clapeyron slope of the diamond melting line, d T m d P, is positive; the liquid is metallic and there appears to be no \u2026",

The most useful piezoelectric materials display a transition region in their composition phase diagrams, known as a morphotropic phase boundary 1, 2, where the crystal structure changes abruptly and the electromechanical properties are maximal. As a result, modern piezoelectric materials for technological applications are usually complex, engineered, solid solutions, which complicates their manufacture as well as introducing complexity in the study of the microscopic origins of their properties. Here we show that even a pure compound, in this case lead titanate, can display a morphotropic phase boundary under pressure. The results are consistent with first-principles theoretical predictions 3, but show a richer phase diagram than anticipated; moreover, the predicted electromechanical coupling at the \u2026",

            "We have measured the x-ray structure factor S (Q) for SiO 2 glass to 42 GPa in the diamond-anvil cell using new experimetnal techniques for studying amorphous materials at high pressures. Large changes in the first sharp diffraction peak of S (Q) with increasing pressure provide evidence for changes in the medium-range order of the glass (length scales of\u223c 4\u201310 \u00c5). Average pair correlation functions at high pressure reveal significant changes in the nearest-neighbor geometry of the glass with compression. Between 8 and 28 GPa the coordination of Si increases, and at 42 GPa the value is close to six.",

            "There has been considerable interest in the synthesis of new nitrides because of their technological and fundamental importance 1, 2. Although numerous metals react with nitrogen there are no known binary nitrides of the noble metals. We report the discovery and characterization of platinum nitride (PtN), the first binary nitride of the noble metals group. This compound can be formed above 45\u201350 GPa and temperatures exceeding 2,000 K, and is stable after quenching to room pressure and temperature. It is characterized by a very high Raman-scattering cross-section with easily observed second-and third-order Raman bands. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows that the new phase is cubic with a remarkably high bulk modulus of 372 (\u00b15) GPa.",
