            "We apply the full power of modern electronic band-structure engineering and epitaxial heterostructures to design a transistor that can sense and control a single-donor electron spin. Spin-resonance transistors may form the technological basis for quantum information processing. One-and two-qubit operations are performed by applying a gate bias. The bias electric field pulls the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different alloy composition. Owing to the variation of the g factor (Si: g= 1.998, Ge: g= 1.563), this displacement changes the spin Zeeman energy, allowing single-qubit operations. By displacing the electron even further, the overlap with neighboring qubits is affected, which allows two-qubit operations. Certain silicon-germanium alloys allow a qubit spacing as large as 200 nm, which is well within the capabilities of current lithographic techniques. We discuss manufacturing \u2026",

            "In the high-magnetic-field low-disorder limit the ground state at \u03bd= 1\/5 Landau-level filling is an incompressible quantum liquid. This is determined by observing vanishing resistivity \u03c1 x x as the temperature T\u2192 0. At filling factors below \u03bd= 1\/5 as well as in a narrow region above \u03bd= 1\/5, \u03c1 x x diverges exponentially as T\u2192 0. This contrasts the T dependence at any higher \u03bd. We conclude that the quantum liquid at \u03bd= 1\/5 is surrounded by a different phase. In as much as the exponential divergencies are indicative of an electron solid this phase is reentrant in a narrow region above \u03bd= 1\/5.",

Such control would be invaluable for nanoscopic spin electronics, quantum information processing using individual electron spin qubits and magnetic resonance imaging of single molecules. There have been several examples 1, 2 of magnetic resonance detection of a single-electron spin in solids. Spin resonance of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has been detected optically 3, and spin precession of a localized electron spin on a surface was detected 4, 5 using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Spins in semiconductors are particularly attractive for study because of their very long decoherence times 6.

With increasing barrier thickness between the two wells, initially the magnetic field destroys only the \u03bd= 1 state, then both the \u03bd= 1 and \u03bd= 3 states disappear.

            "This work investigated in-plane MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) for the application of spin torque transfer random access memory (STT-RAM). The MTJ in this work had an resistance area product (RA)\u2009=\u20094.3 \u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm2, tunneling magnetoresistance ratio \u223c135%, thermal stability factor \u0394(H)=68 (by field measurement), and \u0394(I)\u2009=\u200950 (by current measurement). The optimal writing energy was found to be 0.286 pJ per bit at 1.54 ns for antiparallel (AP) state to parallel (P) state switching, and 0.706 pJ per bit at 0.68 ns for P state to AP state switching. Ultra fast spin torque transfer (STT) switching was also observed in this sample at 580 ps (AP to P) and 560 ps (P to AP). As a result, 0.6\u20131.3 GHz was determined to be the optimal writing rate from writing energy consumption of view. These results show that in-plane MgO MTJs are still a viable candidate as the fast memory cell for STT-RAM.",

Excited state spectroscopy of the QD has been performed using a charge-sensing technique. T 1 of single spin excited states has been done in the time domain by a pump-and-probe method. For an odd and an even number of electrons, we found a magnetic field dependent and invariant T 1, respectively.",
