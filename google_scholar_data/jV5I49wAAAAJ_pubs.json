We concentrate on radial flow and the elliptic flow coefficient v 2 as functions of the impact parameter and collision energy. We demonstrate that the finally observed elliptic flow is established earlier in the collision than the observed radial flow and thus probes the equation of state at higher energy densities. We point out that a phase transition from hadronic matter to a color-deconfined quark-gluon plasma leads to nonmonotonic behavior in both beam energy and impact parameter dependences which, if observed, can be used to identify such a phase transition.

The model provides a very good description of all measured momentum distributions in central and semiperipheral Au+Au collisions, including the momentum anisotropics (elliptic flow) and systematic dependencies on the hadron rest masses up to transverse momenta of about 1.5\u20132 GeV\/c. This provides impressive evidence that the bulk of the fireball matter shows efficient thermalization and behaves hydrodynamically. At higher pT the hydrodynamic model begins to gradually break down, following an interesting pattern which we discuss.

The low density limit LDL is inconsistent with the measured magnitude of v2 at RHIC energies and with the shape of its pt-dependence at both RHIC and SPS energies.

            "We study the elliptic flow coefficient v 2 (\u03b7, b) in Au+ Au collisions at s= 200 A GeV as a function of pseudorapidity \u03b7 and impact parameter b. Using a hybrid approach which combines early ideal fluid dynamical evolution with late hadronic rescattering, we demonstrate strong dissipative effects from the hadronic rescattering stage on the elliptic flow. With Glauber model initial conditions, hadronic dissipation is shown to be sufficient to fully explain the differences between measured v 2 values and ideal hydrodynamic predictions. Initial conditions based on the Color Glass Condensate model generate larger elliptic flow and seem to require additional dissipation during the early quark\u2013gluon plasma stage in order to achieve agreement with experiment.",
