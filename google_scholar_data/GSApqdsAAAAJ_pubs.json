            "The newly discovered 39-K superconductor MgB 2 1 holds great promise for superconducting electronics. Like the conventional superconductor Nb, MgB 2 is a phonon-mediated superconductor 2, with a relatively long coherence length 3. These properties make the prospect of fabricating reproducible uniform Josephson junctions, the fundamental element of superconducting circuits, much more favourable for MgB 2 than for high-temperature superconductors. The higher transition temperature and larger energy gap 4, 5 of MgB 2 promise higher operating temperatures and potentially higher speeds than Nb-based integrated circuits. However, success in MgB 2 Josephson junctions has been limited because of the lack of an adequate thin-film technology 6, 7. Because a superconducting integrated circuit uses a multilayer of superconducting, insulating and resistive films, an in situ process in which MgB 2 is formed \u2026",

            "The effect of coupling between layers of the high-T c superconductors was studied by varying both the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x and PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x layer thicknesses in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x\/PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x superlattices. Superconductivity was found even when the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x layers had nominal thicknesses as small as 12 \u00c5 (one unit-cell thickness) but coupling between unit-cell layers is needed to achieve a T c of 90 K. The decrease of T c in isolated YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x layers with increasing sheet resistance is on the same scale of about \u0127\/e 2 as observed for ordinary superconductors.",

            "The magnetoresistance of epitaxial Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO\u03b4 thin films has been studied. A giant magnetoresistance, with more than 4 orders of magnitude change in resistance (\u2212\u0394R\/RH\u2273106%), was obtained at \u223c60 K and a magnetic field of 8 T. This giant magnetoresistance (GMR) ratio is about one order of magnitude larger than the highest value reported previously which was observed in La\u2013Ca\u2013Mn\u2013O film. We have also obtained a large GMR ratio with \u2212\u0394R\/RH\u22733000% for H=5 T in an in situ Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO\u03b4 thin film, a much larger effect than the previous results in doped manganese oxide films in which a large GMR ratio was obtained only in postannealed samples. Our results also show that the GMR effect in these films can be strongly influenced by the thin\u2010film preparation conditions.",

Both \u03c3 and in-plane \u03c0 holes on O, formed upon doping, are compatible with our experimental results. For YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7, in both cases, holes must be in the planes and in the ribbons. Out-of-plane \u03c0 holes can be excluded for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8. In the undoped and doped compounds, the unoccupied states on the Cu sites have & symmetry.
