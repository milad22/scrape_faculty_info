            "Lanthanum substituted Ni-Zn ferrite nanoparticles (Ni0.5Zn0.5LaxFe1-xO4; 0.00 \u2264x\u2264 1.00) synthesized by sol-gel method were presented. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal the typical single phase spinel cubic ferrite structure, with the traces of secondary phase for lanthanum substituted nanocrystals. In addition, the structural analysis also demonstrates that the average crystallite size varied in the range of 21\u201325 nm. FTIR spectra present the two prominent absorption bands in the range of 400 to 600 cm-1 which are the fingerprint region of all ferrites. Surface morphology of both substituted and unsubstituted Ni-Zn ferrite nanoparticle samples was studied using FESEM technique and it indicates a significant increase in the size of spherical shaped particles with La3+ substitution. Magnetic properties of all samples were analyzed using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results revealed that saturation magnetization (Ms) and coercivity (Hc) of La3+ substituted samples has decreased as compared to the Ni-Zn ferrite samples. Hence, the observed results affirm that the lanthanum ion substitution has greatly influenced the structural, morphology and magnetic properties of Ni-Zn ferrite nanoparticles.",

            "Due to the geographical location and technological limitation, various novel enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods has been proposed to recover the remaining oil from a depleted oil reservoir. Research on application of nanoparticles either on its own or coupled with other stimulating agents has been growing enormously and some of them have shown a promising future. In high temperature and high pressure reservoirs, thermal degradation will cause failure to the conventional chemicals. In this work, temperature-stable YIG magnetic nanoparticles with an electromagnetic wave has been proposed as a new candidate for reservoir stimulating agent. The purpose of nanoparticle injection is to increase the sweep efficiency in the reservoir by increasing the viscosity of displacing fluid.

            "In the quest to enhance reinforcement efficiency of graphene in metal matrices, various processing techniques have been devised over recent years. As the advancement in this field nowhere seems to slow down, the processing aspects of graphene-reinforced metal matrix composites are becoming more relevant than ever. In that premise, there lies an imminent need for a critical assessment of existing fabrication routes and their ability to extend a solution for the primary challenges of agglomeration, dispersion, interfacial interaction and structural integrity of graphene in metal matrix composites. This review presents a brief yet a meaningful insight to the processing techniques for graphene-reinforced metal matrix composites, while highlighting the key findings from individual studies, thereby expressing the primitive challenges and strengthens of these techniques.

Therefore, a novel surfactant MWCNTs and eco-friendly Jatropha seed oil based nanofluid are synthesized via one-step synthesis method and subjected to characterization via visual analysis, FTIR, Zeta potential, pore size distribution, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and UV analysis to investigate MWCNTs dispersion stability along with thermal conductivity measurement.

Magnetic nanoparticles which are activated by a magnetic field are anticipated to have the ability to travel far into the oil reservoir and assist in the displacement of the trapped oil. In this work, magnetic Fe 2 O 3-Al 2 O 3 nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized for its morphological, structural and magnetic properties. At an annealing temperature of 900 C, this nanomaterial starts to exhibit magnetization as the composite structure crystallizes to the stable Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3. Subsequently, dispersion of the 0.01 wt% Fe 2 O 3-Al 2 O 3 nanocomposite in distilled water was used for displacement tests to validate its feasibility to be applied in EOR. In the \u2026",

The effect of calcination temperature on crystalline structures was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the crystallization of the samples La-substituted YIG x= 0.0 and x= 0.5 is more completed when the calcination temperature increases. However, Fe2O3 phase was formed in the sample with La substitution of x= 1.0 when the temperature increases. The sizes of substituted YIG particles calculated from Scherrer equation were ranged from 29 to 71 nm and it was found increased with the increasing of calcination temperature.",
