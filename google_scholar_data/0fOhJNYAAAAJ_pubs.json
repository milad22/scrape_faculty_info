            "Recent habituation literature is reviewed with emphasis on neuro-physiological studies. The hindlimb flexion reflex of the acute spinal cat is used as a model system for analysis of the neuronal mechanisms involved in habituation and sensitization (ie, dishabituation). Habituation of this response is demonstrated to follow the same 9 parametric relations for stimulus and training variables characteristic of behavioral response habituation in the intact organism. Habituation and sensitization appear to be central neural processes and probably do not involve presynaptic or postsynaptic inhibition. It is suggested that they may result from the interaction of neural processes resembling\" polysynaptic low-frequency depression,\" and\" facilitatory afterdischarge.\"\" Membrane desensitization\" may play a role in long-lasting habituation.(6 p. ref.)(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Noticing that the dogs salivated at the mere sight of the person who fed them, Pavlov formulated a theory about the relationship between stimuli and responses that he believed could be applied to humans as well as to other animals. He called the dogs\u2019 salivation in response to the actual taste and smell of meat an unconditioned response because it occurred through a natural reflex without any prior training (the meat itself was referred to as an unconditioned stimulus). A normally neutral act, such as the appearance of a lab assistant in a white coat or the ringing of a bell, could become associated with the appearance of food, thus producing salivation as a conditioned response (in response to a conditioned stimulus). Pavlov believed that the conditioned reflex had a physiological basis in the creation of new pathways in the cortex of the brain by the conditioning process. In further research early in the 20th century, Pavlov found that in order for the conditioned response to be maintained, it had to be paired periodically with the unconditioned stimulus or the learned association would be forgotten (a process known as extinction). However, it could quickly be relearned if necessary.In humans, classical conditioning can account for such complex phenomena as a person\u2019s emotional reaction to a particular song or perfume based on a past experience with which it is associated. Classical (sometimes called Pavlovian) conditioning is also the \u2026",

            "Rabbits received classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response (NMR) in a trace conditioning paradigm. In this paradigm, a 250-ms tone conditioned stimulus (CS) occurs, after which there is a 500-ms period of time in which no stimuli occur (the trace interval), followed by a 100-ms air puff unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In Experiment 1, lesions of the hippocampus or cingulate\/retrosplenial cortex disrupted acquisition of the long-latency or adaptive conditioned response relative to unoperated controls and animals that received neocortical lesions that spared the cingulate\/retrosplenial areas. When animals with hippocampal or cingulate\/retrosplenial lesions were switched to a standard delay paradigm in which the CS and UCS were contiguous in time, they acquired in about the same number of trials as naive rabbits. In a second experiment multiple-unit activity in area CA1 of the hippocampus was \u2026",

            "Classical conditioning of the eyeblink reflex to a neutral stimulus that predicts an aversive stimulus is a basic form of associative learning. Acquisition and retention of this learned response require the cerebellum and associated sensory and motor pathways and engage several other brain regions including the hippocampus, neocortex, neostriatum, septum, and amygdala. The cerebellum and its associated circuitry form the essential neural system for delay eyeblink conditioning. Trace eyeblink conditioning, a learning paradigm in which the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli are noncontiguous, requires both the cerebellum and the hippocampus and exhibits striking parallels to declarative memory formation in humans. Identification of the neural structures critical to the development and maintenance of the conditioned eyeblink response is an essential precursor to the investigation of the mechanisms \u2026",
