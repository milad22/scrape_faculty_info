As the disorder strength increases, we observe a crossover to a spatially inhomogeneous regime of plastic flow, with a very defective vortex array and a channel-like structure of the flowing regions. The two regimes are characterized by qualitatively different spatial distributions of vortex velocities. In the crinkle regime the distribution of vortex velocities near threshold has a single maximum that shifts to larger velocities as the driving force is increased.

            "The critical behavior of charge-density waves (CDWs) in the pinned phase is studied for applied fields increasing toward the threshold field, using recently developed renormalization-group techniques and simulations of automaton models. Despite the existence of many metastable states in the pinned state of the CDW, the renormalization-group treatment can be used successfully to find the divergences in the polarization and the correlation length, and, to first order in an \u03b5= 4-d expansion, the diverging time scale. The automaton models studied are a charge-density wave model and a \u2018\u2018sandpile\u2019\u2019model with periodic boundary conditions; these models are found to have the same critical behavior, associated with diverging avalanche sizes. The numerical results for the polarization and the diverging length and time scales in dimensions d= 2, 3 are in agreement with the analytical treatment. These results clarify the \u2026",

            "The problem of determining the ground state of a d-dimensional interface embedded in a (d+ 1)-dimensional random medium is treated numerically. Using a minimum-cut algorithm, the exact ground states can be found for a number of problems for which other numerical methods are inexact and slow. In particular, results are presented for the roughness exponents and ground-state energy fluctuations in a random bond Ising model. It is found that the roughness exponent \u03b6= 0.41\u00b10.01, 0.22\u00b10.01, with the related energy exponent being \u03b8= 0.84\u00b10.03, 1.45\u00b10.04, in d= 2, 3, respectively. These results are compared with previous analytical and numerical estimates.",
