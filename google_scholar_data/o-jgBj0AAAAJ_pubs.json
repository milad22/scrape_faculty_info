The reported amount of information processing increased with both task variety and analyzability; the reported use of equivocal information decreased with task analyzability.

The authors conclude that structuration theory is a more focused, informative, integrative, yet efficient, way to analyse how accounting systems are implicated in the construction, maintenance, and changes of the social order of an organization, than many frameworks used in previous studies. This article also speculates that Giddens' structuration theory with its key concepts of \u201cstructuration\u201d and the \u201cduality of structure\u201d can be read along with Foucault's \u201cpower\/knowledge\u201d and Derrida's \u201cdeconstruction\u201d as a post-modern genre for critical accounting research.",

It draws on Baudrillard's concepts of simulacra, hyperreality and implosion to trace the historical transformations of the accounting signs of income and capital from Sumerian times to the present. It posits that accounting today no longer refers to any objective reality but instead circulates in a \u201chyperreality\u201d of self-referential models. The paper then examines this conclusion from the viewpoint of recent clean surplus model research and argues that the distinction between income and capital is arbitrary and irrelevant provided the measurement process satisfies the clean surplus relation. Although accounting is arbitrary and hyperreal, it does impart a sense of exogeniety and predictability, particularly through the \u2026",

            "In this paper we argue that ethnographic or interpretive accounting research studies (EARS), which have been marginalized by critical accounting theory studies (CATS) and rational accounting theory studies (RATS), are a valuable way to understand the way accounting works in actual organizational settings. The problem of researching trust and its relation to accounting is used as an example where EARS seems to hold the edge over both CATS and RATS. The paper describes three main types of EARS\u2014cognitive anthropology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology, briefly describes a classical ethnographic study and an accounting example of each type. It then sets up a conversational debate between EARS, CATS, and RATS in order to bring out their major points of disagreement and concurrence. The paper concludes by speculating that some sort of rapprochment might be worked out whereby \u2026",

            "Management control research from organization theory, accounting, and business policy is reviewed; and a two-stage qualitative study of management control systems (MCSs) used in business organizations is reported. The study identified four MCS components used at the middle management level: budget, policies and procedures, performance appraisal system, and statistical reports. Each MCS component played a role during the control cycle of target setting, monitoring, and corrective feedback. The findings were used to propose two models: One model links the MCS to business level strategy implementation, and the other defines primary and secondary roles for MCS components in the management control process.",

            "In the business world, recent years have seen a growing acknowledgement of the value of intangible assets rather than physical assets. This has precipitated a crisis in the accounting industry: the accounting representations relied upon for years can no longer be taken for granted. Here, Norman Macintosh argues that we now need to understand accounting in a different manner. Offering several different ways of looking at accounting and accountants, he draws upon the work of eminent thinkers such as Barthes, Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard and Bahktin. In doing this, he develops revolutionary insights into the nature of accounting, pioneering the introduction of contemporary poststructuralist ideas into accounting theory and practice. With a wide range of examples and case studies, this revolutionary new work will be essential reading for academic and professional accountants along with all those with an interest in the future of accounting.",
