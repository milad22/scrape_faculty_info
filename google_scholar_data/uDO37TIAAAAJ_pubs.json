            "The zeroth, first, and second spectral moments of the rototranslational collision-induced absorption (RT CIA) spectra of hydrogen-helium mixtures are calculated from the fundamental theory, for temperatures from 40 to 3000 K. With the help of simple analytical functions of three parameters and the information given, the RT CIA spectra of H2-He pairs can be generated on computers of small capacity, with rms deviations from exact quantum profiles of not more than a few percent. Such representations of the CIA spectra are of interest for work related to the atmospheres of the outer planets and cool stars. The theoretical spectra are in close agreement with existing laboratory measurements at various temperatures from about 77 to 3000 K.",

The present paper is concerned with the collision-induced translational-rotational absorption coefficient for molecular hydrogen pairs, taking into account computations on the basis of the fundamental theory considered by Meyer et al. Data have been obtained for temperatures in the range from 40 to 300 K. Criteria are developed for choosing among various model line shapes.

Measured broad profiles, on the other hand, are asymmetric (principle of detailed balance) and can be reproduced from a much more involved quantum theory. Various desymmetrization procedures are known which, when applied to classical profiles, result in a line shape that is formally consistent with the asymmetry required by detailed balance. It is an interesting fact that various desymmetrization procedures known give rise to very different profiles. Little is known about which (if any) results in a simple but accurate substitute for the quantum shape.An ab initio quantum calculation is in close agreement with a measurement of the binary collision induced, translational Raman spectrum of helium at 30 amagat. To a classical line shape based on the same input, four common desymmetrization procedures are applied. The comparison shows \u2026",

The breakdown was formed at the sample surface by a Q-switched ND: YAG laser operating at a 1.06-\u03bcm wavelength and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. Contamination levels were inferred from the ratio of the integrated emission line of lead to a known reference line of the matrix. The lead contamination can be determined on an absolute scale down to 10 ppm at an optimum delay time of 3.0 \u03bcs. These results were derived from analysis of the temporal evolution of the calibration function within a 0.1- to 19.0-\u03bcs time range. The calibration function exhibits no dependence on the incident laser pulse energy, which was varied from 250 to 400 mJ.",
