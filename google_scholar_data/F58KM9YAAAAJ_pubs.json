Chimeric antigen receptor\u2013modified T cells targeting CD19 may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies and induce remission in patients with refractory disease.We infused autologous T cells transduced with a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CTL019) lentiviral vector in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL at doses of 0.76\u00d7106 to 20.6\u00d7106 CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. Patients were monitored for a response, toxic effects, and the expansion and persistence of circulating CTL019 T cells.A total of 30 children and adults received CTL019.
