            "We study the phase diagram of the half-filled one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at weak coupling using a novel functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. The FRG method includes in a systematic manner the effects of the scattering processes involving electrons away from the Fermi points. Our results confirm the existence of a finite region of bond charge density wave, also known as a \u201cbond order wave\u201d near U= 2 V and clarify why earlier g-ology calculations have not found this phase. We argue that this is an example in which formally irrelevant corrections change the topology of the phase diagram. Whenever marginal terms lead to an accidental symmetry, this generalized FRG method may be crucial to characterize the phase diagram accurately.",

When crossing symmetry is not imposed, the convergence of both simple iteration and more complicated continuous loading (homotopy) methods is limited to high temperatures and weak interactions. We modify the algorithm to impose the crossing symmetry without increasing the computational complexity. We also imposed time reversal and a subset of the point group symmetries, but they did not further improve the convergence. We elaborate the details of the latency hiding scheme which can significantly improve the performance in the computational implementation. With these modifications, stable solutions for the parquet equations can be obtained by iteration more quickly even for values of the interaction that are a significant fraction of \u2026",

In LiHo x Y 1\u2212 x F 4, the Ho 3+ moments, which are well described by Ising spins with only discrete \u201cup or down\u201d directions, interact predominantly via the inherently frustrated magnetostatic dipole-dipole interactions. The random frustration causing the SG behavior originates from the random substitution of dipole-coupled Ho 3+ by nonmagnetic Y 3+. In this Letter, we provide compelling evidence from extensive computer simulations that a SG transition at nonzero temperature occurs in a realistic microscopic model of LiHo x Y 1\u2212 x F 4. This resolves the long-standing, and still ongoing, controversy about the existence of a SG transition in disordered dipolar Ising systems.",

Our method successfully captures the localization phenomenon both in the low and large disorder regimes, and allows us to study the localization in different momenta cells, which renders the discovery that the Anderson localization transition occurs in a cell-selective fashion. As a function of cluster size, our method systematically recovers the reentrance behavior of the mobility edge and obtains the correct critical disorder strength for Anderson localization in 3D.",

Recently, the existence of a third phase, which is metallic and lies in a finite region of parameter space between these two gapped phases, has been claimed. We study this claim using a renormalization-group method for interacting electrons that has been extended to include also e\u2212 p h couplings. Our method [Tsai et al., Phys. Rev. B 72, 054531 (2005); Philos. Mag. B 86, 2631 (2006)] treats e\u2212 e and e\u2212 p h interactions on an equal footing and takes retardation effects fully into account.

This approach employs an exact mapping from a real lattice to a DCA cluster of linear size L c embedded in a dual fermion lattice. Short-length-scale physics is addressed by the DCA cluster calculation, while longer-length-scale physics is addressed diagrammatically using dual fermions. The bare and dressed dual fermionic Green functions scale as O (1\/L c), so perturbation theory on the dual lattice converges very quickly, eg, the dual Fermion self-energy calculated with simple second-order perturbation theory is of order O (1\/L c 3) with third-order and three-body corrections down by an additional factor of O (1\/L c).",

However, the effect of frustration due to random disorder, in particular the possible spin glass phase, remains a crucial but poorly understood problem. One of the obstacles in the Monte Carlo simulation of random frustrated systems is their long relaxation time making an efficient parallel implementation on state-of-the-art computation platforms highly desirable. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is such a platform that provides an opportunity to significantly enhance the computational performance and thus gain new insight into this problem.
