Often however, such systems can be hard to set up, generate large amounts of unfiltered data, and must be carefully monitored to prevent their being used as a platform for further attacks. This paper discusses the development of a honeynet system that computing professionals and researchers can set up, scale, and use with relative ease. The system monitors intruders' activities on individual honeypots then aggregates their movements into a single database, making the data easily accessible and searchable for study through a graphical front-end. To test this open-source solution, the authors replicate a portion of a seminal criminological study by Maimon et al.[4] finding corroborating \u2026",
