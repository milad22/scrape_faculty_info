            "We achieve tunneling spin injection from Co into single layer graphene (SLG) using TiO 2 seeded MgO barriers. A nonlocal magnetoresistance (\u0394 R NL) of 130 \u03a9 is observed at room temperature, which is the largest value observed in any material. Investigating \u0394 R NL vs SLG conductivity from the transparent to the tunneling contact regimes demonstrates the contrasting behaviors predicted by the drift-diffusion theory of spin transport. Furthermore, tunnel barriers reduce the contact-induced spin relaxation and are therefore important for future investigations of spin relaxation in graphene.",

The room-temperature deposition of TM onto graphene produces clusters that dope n type for all TM investigated (Ti, Fe, and Pt). We also find that the scattering by TM clusters exhibits different behavior compared to 1\/r Coulomb scattering. At high coverage, Pt films are able to produce doping that is either n type or weakly p type, which provides experimental evidence for a strong interfacial dipole favoring n-type doping as predicted theoretically.",

The dependence of the nonlocal magnetoresistance on electrode spacing is investigated and the results indicate a spin diffusion length of \u223c1.6\u2002\u03bcm and a spin injection\/detection efficiency of 0.013. Electrical detection of the spin precession confirms that the nonlocal signal originates from spin injection and transport. Fitting of the Hanle spin precession data yields a spin relaxation time of \u223c84\u2002ps and a spin diffusion length of \u223c1.5\u2002\u03bcm, which is consistent with the value obtained through the spacing dependence.",

The spin injection and transport in single layer graphene (SLG) were investigated using nonlocal magnetoresistance (MR) measurements. Spin injection was performed using either transparent contacts (Co\/SLG) or tunneling contacts (Co\/MgO\/SLG). With tunneling contacts, the nonlocal MR was increased by a factor of \u223c1000 and the spin injection\/detection efficiency was greatly enhanced from \u223c1% (transparent contacts) to \u223c30%. Spin relaxation was investigated on graphene spin valves using nonlocal Hanle measurements. For transparent contacts, the spin lifetime was in the range of 50\u2013100 ps. The effects of surface chemical doping showed that for spin lifetimes in the order of 100 ps, charged impurity scattering (Au) was not the dominant mechanism for spin relaxation.
