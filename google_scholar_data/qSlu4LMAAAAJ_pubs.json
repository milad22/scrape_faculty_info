Preparation of the neutral cluster in a highly nonequilibrium state by electron detachment from the mass\u2010selected anion, and subsequent probing of the neutral nuclear dynamics through two\u2010photon ionization to the cationic state, leads to strongly probe\u2010energy\u2010dependent transient cation\u2010abundance signals. The origin of this pronounced time and wavelength dependence of the ionization probability on the femtosecond scale is revealed by ab initio theoretical simulations of the transient spectra. Based on the analysis of underlying dynamics, two fundamental processes involving geometry relaxation from linear to triangular structure followed by ultrafast intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) have been identified and for the first time experimentally \u2026",

            "Ultrathin metal oxide films have attracted considerable interest in recent years as versatile substrate for the design of nanocatalytic model systems. In particular, it has been proposed theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the electronic structure of adsorbates can be influenced by the layer thickness and the stoichiometry, i.e., the type and number of defects, of the oxide film. This has important consequences on the chemical reactivity of the oxide surface itself and of oxide supported metal clusters. It also opens new possibilities to influence and to control chemical reactions occurring at the surface of these systems. The present feature focuses on very recent experiments that illustrate the effects of a proper adjustment of layer thickness and composition of ultrathin MgO(100) films on chemical transformations. On the magnesia surface itself, the photodissociation dynamics of methyl iodide molecules is \u2026",

Depending on the excitation wavelength and the MgO layer thickness, either one or two photon photoemission was detected at 333 and at 402 nm. This photoemission was assigned to originate from the molybdenum d band states even for 10 monolayers MgO coverage. At 263 nm excitation, however, the photoemission power dependence indicated that the signal contained both contributions from the Mo metal d electrons and from the MgO O2p valence band. While one nominal monolayer of MgO only slightly influenced the photoemission from the molybdenum surface, a considerable reduction of the surface electronic work function was observed for ultrathin magnesia overlayers of 2 to 3 monolayers in thickness.

            "A novel experimental approach to the investigation of surface adsorbate reaction dynamics is presented. The direct time-resolved monitoring of the surface reaction transition state and product formation dynamics were accomplished via pump-probe mass spectrometry. As an example, methyl iodide molecules adsorbed at submonolayer coverage on an ultrathin magnesia film on Mo(100) were photoexcited to the A-band by ultrafast laser pulse irradiation. Employing time-delayed multiphoton ionization the dynamics of the dissociative methyl iodide transition state and of the emerging methyl photoproduct could be detected with femtosecond resolution. The reaction times deduced from the temporal evolution of the methyl ion mass signal indicate a strong interaction of the methyl fragment with the substrate surface prior to desorption.",
