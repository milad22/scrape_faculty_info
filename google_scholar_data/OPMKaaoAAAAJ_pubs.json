            "Laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectra of peptides and proteins, as well as of lower molecular weight ana-lytes, have been obtained by using a pulsed nitrogen UV laser (337 nm) to irradiate mixtures of 2-150 \u00b5 graphite particles and solutions of the analytes in glycerol. Protonated analytes as well as abundant alkali cation adducts were observed. Carbon cluster ions, C \u201e+, typically had a low abundance but dominated the mass spectrum at elevated laser powers. In spectra of a cytochrome c tryptic digest, all but one of the tryptic peptides were easily observed. Spectra of low molecular weight analytes dissolved in glycerol are very similar to FAB spectra of the same glycerol solution with added alkali salts. However, in many peptide and protein spectra, glycerol ion abundances are very low, and the alkali ions dominate thespectra at low mass. These spectra may correspond to wet and dry surface desorption \u2026",

            "Columns packed with microsized titanium dioxide particles have been used effectively as precolumns for enriching phosphopeptides from complex mixtures. Nanosized titanium dioxide particles have a higher specific surface area and, hence, potentially higher trapping capacities toward phosphopeptides than do microsized particles. Thus, in this study, we employed TiO2-coated magnetic (Fe3O4\/TiO2 core\/shell) nanoparticles to selectively concentrate phosphopeptides from protein digest products. Because of their magnetic properties, the Fe3O4\/TiO2 core\/shell nanoparticles that are conjugated to the target peptides can be isolated readily from the sample solutions by employing a magnetic field. In this paper, we also demonstrate that the Fe3O4\/TiO2 core\/shell nanoparticles behave as an effective SALDI matrix:\u2009 our upper detectable mass limit was \u223c24\u2009000 Da, whereas the detection limit for peptides was in \u2026",

            "Matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) provides a straightforward means to differentiate microorganism species based on mass spectral fingerprinting. The pathogen cell concentration in an infected sample, however, is generally lower than that capable of being detected directly by MALDI-MS. Furthermore, the presence of proteins or metabolites in biological fluids always causes unavoidable interference for the identification of microorganism species. Vancomycin, which binds to d-Ala-d-Ala moieties on the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria and, therefore, inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, is one of the most potent antibiotics. Thus, we have employed vancomycin-modified magnetic nanoparticles as affinity probes to selectively trap Gram-positive pathogens from sample solutions; i.e., these bacteria can be isolated from sample solutions by applying a magnetic field.

In addition to their magnetic property, the nanoprobes have other features including a photocatalytic property and the capacity to target bacteria. The nanoprobes comprise iron oxide\/titania (Fe3O4@TiO2) core\/shell magnetic nanoparticles. As dopamine molecules can self\u2010assemble onto the surface of the titania substrate, dopamine is used as the linker to immobilize succinic anhydride onto the surfaces of the Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles. This is followed by the immobilization of IgG via amide bonding.
