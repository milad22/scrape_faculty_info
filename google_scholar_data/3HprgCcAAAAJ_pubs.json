The unit cell volume increases and the microstrain in the compound shows peak formation as the particle size decreases. Nano particles of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3\u2212\u03b4 exhibit superparamagnetism whose blocking temperature has a nonlinear and logarithmic decreasing tendency as function of particle size and applied magnetic field, respectively. Evidence of formation of a magnetically dead layer at the surface has been found and the ratio of the thickness of the dead layer to the particle size increases exponentially with particle size. The coercivity of the nanoparicles increases manifold as particle size varies from 53 nm to 21 nm. In the single domain region the coercivity exhibits a d\u22121.125 behavior.

For La1\u2212xCexMnO3 (LCMO), an increase in Ce concentration is accompanied by an increase in TC from 225 to 236 K, as well as an increase in the electrical resistivity. An extremely high resistivity is observed in the new system Ce1\u2212xSrxMnO3 (CSMO) which becomes insulating below its Curie temperature of 43 K. A maximum magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of 40% for CSMO and 53% for LCMO is observed. A larger change in resistivity is seen to correspond to an increase in the Ce concentration, however this is offset by an overall resistivity increase which keeps the MR ratio low. The high resistivity may be due to unreacted oxides in the samples. If true, the amount of impurity appears to be proportional to the Ce doping. If this impurity level can be reduced, a \u2026",

            "Rutaecarpine (Rut) has been shown to induce hypotension and vasorelaxation. In vitro studies indicated that the vasorelaxant effect of Rut was largely endothelium-dependent. We previously reported that Rut increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in cultured rat endothelial cells (ECs) and decreased [Ca2+]i in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle (VSMCs) cells. The present results showed that the hypotensive effect of Rut (10\u2013100 \u03bcg\/kg i.v.) was significantly blocked by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitorN\u03c9-nitro-l-arginine. In aortic rings, Rut (0.1\u20133.0 \u03bcM)-induced vasorelaxation was inhibited byN\u03c9-nitro-l-arginine and hydroquinone but not by antagonists of the various K+ channels, 4-aminopyridine, apamin, charybdotoxin, or glibenclamide. Rut (0.1 and 1.0 \u03bcM) inhibited the norepinephrine-induced contraction generated by Ca2+ influx and at 1.0 \u03bcM increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) production in \u2026",
