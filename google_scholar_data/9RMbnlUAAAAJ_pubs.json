Using a real time formulation of finite temperature field theory we derive, up to two loops and O (\u03bb 2), the effective equation of motion describing the approach to equilibrium. We present a detailed analysis of the approximations used in order to obtain a Langevin-like equation of motion, in which the noise and dissipation terms associated with quantum fluctuations obey a fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show that, in general, the noise is colored (time dependent) and multiplicative (couples nonlinearly to the field), even though it is still Gaussian distributed. The noise becomes white in the infinite temperature limit. We also address the effect of couplings to other fields, which we assume play the role of the thermal bath, in the effective equation of motion for \u03c6.

Using a real-time formulation of finite temperature field theory, we compute the effective evolution equation of a scalar field configuration, quadratically interacting with a given set of other scalar fields. We then show that, in the overdamped regime, the dissipative kernel in the field equation of motion is closely related to the shear viscosity coefficient, as computed in scalar field theory at finite temperature. The effective dynamics is equivalent to a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau description of the approach to equilibrium in phenomenological theories of phase transitions.

As these equilibrium configurations naturally present local anisotropy, it is sensible to expect departures from the well-known stability criteria for fluid stars. With this in mind, I investigate the dynamical instability of boson stars against charge-conserving, small radial perturbations. Following the method developed by Chandrasekhar, a variational base for determining the eigenfrequencies of the perturbations is found. This approach allows one to find numerically an upper bound for the central density where dynamical instability occurs. As applications of the formalism, I study the stability of equilibrium configurations obtained both for the free and for the self-interacting [with V (\u03c6)=(\u03bb\/4)\u2016 \u03c6\u2016 4] massive scalar field \u03c6.

For a large range of parameters, nontopological solitons can be cosmologically significant, contributing a significant fraction of the present mass density of the Universe.",

We consider both the Newtonian and the full general-relativistic perturbation treatment. In the general-relativistic case, we extend the variational formalism for spheres with isotropic pressure developed by Chandrasekhar. We find that, in general, when the tangential pressure is greater than the radial pressure, the stability of the anisotropic sphere is enhanced when compared to isotropic configurations. In particular, anisotropic spheres are found to be stable for smaller values of the adiabatic index \u03b3.",
