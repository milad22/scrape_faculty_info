            "We study light propagation in the picture of semiclassical space-time that emerges in canonical quantum gravity in the loop representation. In such a picture, where space-time exhibits a polymerlike structure at microscales, it is natural to expect departures from the perfect nondispersiveness of an ordinary vacuum. We evaluate these departures, computing the modifications to Maxwell\u2019s equations due to quantum gravity and showing that under certain circumstances nonvanishing corrections appear that depend on the helicity of propagating waves. These effects could lead to observable cosmological predictions of the discrete nature of quantum space-time. In particular, recent observations of nondispersiveness in the spectra of gamma-ray bursts at various energies could be used to constrain the type of semiclassical state that describes the universe.",

            "Aimed at students and researchers entering the field, this pedagogical introduction to numerical relativity will also interest scientists seeking a broad survey of its challenges and achievements. Assuming only a basic knowledge of classical general relativity, the book develops the mathematical formalism from first principles, and then highlights some of the pioneering simulations involving black holes and neutron stars, gravitational collapse and gravitational waves. The book contains 300 exercises to help readers master new material as it is presented. Numerous illustrations, many in color, assist in visualizing new geometric concepts and highlighting the results of computer simulations. Summary boxes encapsulate some of the most important results for quick reference. Applications covered include calculations of coalescing binary black holes and binary neutron stars, rotating stars, colliding star clusters, gravitational and magnetorotational collapse, critical phenomena, the generation of gravitational waves, and other topics of current physical and astrophysical significance.",

The book begins with a rapid course on manifolds and differential forms, emphasizing how these provide a proper language for formulating Maxwell's equations on arbitrary spacetimes. The authors then introduce vector bundles, connections and curvature in order to generalize Maxwell theory to the Yang-Mills equations. The relation of gauge theory to the newly discovered knot invariants such as the Jones polynomial is sketched. Riemannian geometry is then introduced in order to describe Einstein's equations of general relativity and show how an attempt to quantize gravity leads to interesting applications of knot theory.",

The book begins with a detailed review of loop representation theory. It then goes on to describe loop representations in Maxwell theory, Yang-Mills theories, as well as lattice techniques.

            "We quantize spherically symmetric vacuum gravity without gauge fixing the diffeomorphism constraint. Through a rescaling, we make the algebra of Hamiltonian constraints Abelian, and therefore the constraint algebra is a true Lie algebra. This allows the completion of the Dirac quantization procedure using loop quantum gravity techniques. We can construct explicitly the exact solutions of the physical Hilbert space annihilated by all constraints. New observables living in the bulk appear at the quantum level (analogous to spin in quantum mechanics) that are not present at the classical level and are associated with the discrete nature of the spin network states of loop quantum gravity. The resulting quantum space-times resolve the singularity present in the classical theory inside black holes.",

The escape photon cones are determined for special families of locally nonrotating, circular geodetical and radially free-falling observers. The silhouette of a rotating black hole, the shape of an equatorial thin accretion disk and the time delay effect for direct and indirect images of a radiating hot spot orbiting the black hole are given and classified in terms of the black hole rotational and tidal parameters. It is shown that increase of the negatively valued tidal parameter, with the rotational parameter fixed, generally strengthens the relativistic effects and suppresses the rotation-induced asymmetries in the optical phenomena.",
