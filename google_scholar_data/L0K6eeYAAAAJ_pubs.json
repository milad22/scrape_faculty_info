            "Performance of rotational friction dampers with two and three units was evaluated experimentally because of a lack of research data on performance of these dampers with multi units. Results of multi-unit dampers were compared with the results of one-unit damper. Increasing trend in dissipating energy was observed. Then, the behavior of these dampers in frames of 3, 7 and 12 stories was studied by modeling the damper directly. Nonlinear time history dynamic analysis was used. It was observed that by increasing the number of stories in the buildings, dampers with multi units should be used to perform properly against earthquake. The equivalent damping method was also investigated to consider the effects of this damper without direct modeling of the damper. Effective damping of the frames equipped with this type of damper was estimated and used in nonlinear time history dynamic analysis and it was \u2026",

            "Complex structures, such as machine tool centers, are comprised of several components attached through different types of joint. The joints introduce much flexibility and damping to the entire structure, which cannot be ignored in the design stage. Ignoring joint effects and modeling the joints as rigid connections result in deviations between the physical structure dynamics and model dynamics. In order to improve the accuracy of model predictions, joint dynamic properties need to be identified and incorporated into a virtual model. Many studies have investigated joint identification in two-dimensional structures. However, different degrees of freedom (DOFs), including rotational and translational, are coupled in the motions of actual physical structures. An accurate joint model should include translational and rotational frequency response functions (FRFs) and consider the joint\u2019s inertial properties. In this study, the \u2026",

            "Mechanical joints have considerable effects on dynamic behaviour of machine tools; thus, joint damping identification is important in studying the dynamics of mechanical structures. Due to the difficulties in analysis of microslip friction, the experimental prediction of microslip joint dynamics is of great importance. In this study, a new experimental approach is proposed to determine the damping of bolted lap joints. Because of the complex nature of the mechanical joints, the lap joint is isolated through the addition of a mechanical resonator, which consists of a lumped mass and spring, to the bolted structure. The frequency response function (FRF) of this system is used for joint damping identification. This approach is used for bolted structures under both translational and torsional excitations and overcomes difficulties associated with slip boundaries identification in the joint interface. The method is verified by \u2026",

            "Chatter is a concern in boring process, due to the low dynamic stiffness of long cantilever boring bars. Chatter suppression in machining permits higher productivity and better surface finishes. In order to improve the performance of boring operations, several researchers have investigated electro- and magneto-rheological fluids and piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuators as vibration absorbers. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of shifting the natural frequency of boring bar based on semi-active fluid control. Mass at the end of a boring bar was modulated to tune its natural frequency by adjusting the level of fluid in a reservoir. At the same time, different damping materials were used to improve dynamics of the boring bar. Experimental modal analysis was used to obtain frequency response functions for different system configurations. A finite element model was proposed and validated with experimental \u2026",

The spray-coated sensors were electrically poled to generate piezoelectric phases. Both the piezoresistive and piezoelectric characteristics of the nanocomposite were utilized for improved performance of the sensors. A Monte Carlo based electro-mechanical model is proposed and was used to investigate the behavior of the nanocomposite sensor.

Some viscoelastic pads are added to the Rotational Friction Damper (RFD) in addition to the friction discs used in this conventional device. Consequently, the amount of energy dissipated by the damper increases in low excitation frequencies. In fact, the input energy to the structure is simultaneously dissipated in the form of friction and heat by frictional discs and viscoelastic pads. In order to compare the performance of this novel damper with the earlier types, a set of experiments were carried out. According to the test results, the RFVD showed a better performance in dissipating input energy to the structure when compared to the RFD. The seismic behavior of steel frames equipped with these dampers was also numerically evaluated based on a nonlinear time history analysis. The numerical results \u2026",

            "Sensors provide an interface between mechanical systems and the physical world. With the move towards Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems, demands for cost-effective sensors are rapidly increasing. Conventional sensors used for monitoring manufacturing processes are often bulky and need complex processes. In this study, a novel high-sensitive nanocomposite-based sensor is developed for measuring strain. The developed sensor is comprised of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a piezoelectric polymer matrix, and embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) nanoparticles creating a conductive network. Exhibiting both piezoelectric and piezoresistive properties, the developed sensors are capable of strain measurement over a wide frequency band, including static and dynamic measurements. The piezoresistive and piezoelectric properties are fused to improve the overall sensitivity and frequency bandwidth of the sensor. To simulate the sensor, a 3D random walk model and a 2D finite element (FE) model are used to predict the electrical resistivity and the piezoelectric characteristics of the sensor, respectively. The developed models are verified with the experimental results. The developed nanocomposite sensors were employed for strain measurement of a cantilever beam under static load, impulse excitation, free and forced vibrations, collecting both piezoelectric and piezoresistive properties measurements. The obtained signals were fused and compared with those of a reference sensor. The results show that the sensor is capable of strain measurement in the range of 0\u201310 kHz, indicating its effectiveness at measuring both static and \u2026",

In this study, the linear stiffness and damping of a joint in the transverse direction are obtained using two different methods: the inverse receptance coupling method and the new analytical joint identification (AJI) approach. The former approach finds the joint frequency response function by determining the difference between the response of the assembled structure and those of the substructures. However, the only required data for the AJI method are modal parameters of the assembled structure, which can be measured using experimental modal analysis. The accuracy of these methods is first investigated using numerical simulations. Experiments are then conducted on a structure consisting of two beams attached to one another in a lap joint.

These methods identify defects based on changes in physical properties of the structure such as mass, stiffness and damping. This will result in detectable changes in the dynamic signatures of the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs). This study presents an experimental process for providing modal analysis in order to identify the defects in the isotropic homogeneous aluminum plate and blocks using the impulse excitation signal generated by an impact hammer. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors are employed to measure the vibration responses of the structures due to the impulse. The FRFs are compared to quantify the changes in measurements between the healthy structures versus damaged structures. Based on the features extracted from measured dynamic behavior of the structures in laboratory experiments, an appropriate signal processing method is utilized to identify the damage. The results indicate that the changes in modal parameters due to damage can be successfully used for damage assessment.",
