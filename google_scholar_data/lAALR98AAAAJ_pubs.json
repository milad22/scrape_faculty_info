            "We present a summary of the results of a simple two-level theory of Doppler cooling in optical molasses and contrast it with the recent theories of multilevel, polarization-gradient cooling. The effects of single-photon recoil and of trapping in microscopic optical potential wells are also considered. Experiments are described in which the temperature of sodium atoms released from optical molasses is measured and found to be well below the Dopplercooling limit. Measurements of the temperature dependence on many experimental parameters are found to be in good qualitative agreement with the new theories of polarization-gradient cooling.",

An archetype of such non-classical motion is tunnelling through an energy barrier. In the 1980s, a new process,\u2018dynamical\u2019tunnelling 1, 2, 3, was predicted, involving no potential energy barrier; however, a constant of the motion (other than energy) still forbids classically the quantum-allowed motion. This process should occur, for example, in periodically driven, nonlinear hamiltonian systems with one degree of freedom 4, 5, 6. Such systems may be chaotic, consisting of regions in phase space of stable, regular motion embedded in a sea of chaos. Previous studies predicted 4 dynamical tunnelling between these stable regions.

            "Lithography can be performed with beams of neutral atoms in metastable excited states to pattern self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiolates on gold. An estimated exposure of a SAM of dodecanethiolate (DDT) to 15 to 20 metastable argon atoms per DDT molecule damaged the SAM sufficiently to allow penetration of an aqueous solution of ferricyanide to the surface of the gold. This solution etched the gold and transformed the patterns in the SAMs into structures of gold; these structures had edge resolution of less than 100 nanometers. Regions of SAMs as large as 2 square centimeters were patterned by exposure to a beam of metastable argon atoms. These observations suggest that this system may be useful in new forms of micro- and nanolithography.",

The reflected light is enhanced by a factor of\u223c 10 5 over scattering from a disordered atomic sample. We measure the magnitude of the reflectivity and its detuning dependence as functions of the density and the degree of localization of the atoms. The change in lattice constant due to the frequency-dependent effective index of refraction seen by the lattice light field is observed.",

With this collective mode we probe the electron density distribution and study the expansion of the plasma as a function of time. For classical plasma conditions, ie, weak Coulomb coupling, the expansion is dominated by the pressure of the electron gas and is described by a hydrodynamic model. Discrepancies between the model and observations at low temperature and high density may be due to strong coupling of the electrons.",
