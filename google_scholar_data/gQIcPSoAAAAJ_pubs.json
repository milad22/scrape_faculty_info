            "Puzzling aspects of high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors include the prevalence of magnetism in the normal state and the persistence of superconductivity in high magnetic fields. Superconductivity and magnetism generally are thought to be incompatible, based on what is known about conventional superconductors. Recent results 1, however, indicate that antiferromagnetism can appear in the superconducting state of a high-T c superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Magnetic fields penetrate a superconductor in the form of quantized flux lines, each of which represents a vortex of supercurrents. Superconductivity is suppressed in the core of the vortex and it has been suggested that antiferromagnetism might develop there 2. Here we report the results of a high-field nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) imaging experiment 3, 4, 5 in which we spatially resolve the electronic \u2026",

            "Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon arising, in its simplest form, from the pairing of fermions with opposite spin into a state with zero net momentum. Whether superconductivity can occur in fermionic systems with an unequal number of two species distinguished by spin or flavour presents an important open question in condensed-matter physics or quantum chromodynamics 1. In condensed matter the imbalance between spin-up and spin-down electrons that form the Cooper pairs is induced by the magnetic field. Such an imbalanced system can lead to exotic superconductivity in which pairs acquire finite momentum 2, 3. This momentum leads to a spatially inhomogeneous state consisting of periodically alternating \u2018normal\u2019and \u2018superconducting\u2019regions. Here, we establish that the hallmark of this state is the appearance of spatially localized and spin-polarized quasiparticles forming the so-called Andreev \u2026",

We identify the microscopic nature of the long range magnetic order (LRO) stabilized at low temperatures in fields above 10.2 T while still in the superconducting (SC) state. We infer that the ordered moment is oriented along the c^ axis and map its field evolution. The study of the field dependence of the NMR shift for the different In sites indicates that the LRO likely coexists with a modulated SC phase, possibly that predicted by Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin, and Ovchinnikov. Furthermore, we discern a field region dominated by strong spin fluctuations where static LRO is absent and propose a revised phase diagram.",

A possible inhomogeneous superconducting state, the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, is stabilized in this part of the phase diagram. In an 11 T applied magnetic field, we observe clear signatures of the two phase transitions: the higher temperature one to the homogeneous superconducting state and the lower temperature phase transition to a FFLO state.

From the optical reflectivity, measured from the far infrared up to the ultraviolet spectral range, we extract the complete absorption spectrum, represented by the real part \u03c31(\u03c9) of the complex optical conductivity. With decreasing temperature below 80 K, we find a progressive depletion of \u03c31(\u03c9) below Eg\u223c300 cm-1, the semiconducting optical gap. The suppressed (Drude) spectral weight within the gap is transferred at energies \u03c9>Eg and also partially piles up over a continuum of excitations extending in the spectral range between zero and Eg. Moreover, the interaction of one phonon mode with this continuum leads to an asymmetric phonon shape.

            "Study of the combined effects of strong electronic correlations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a central issue in quantum materials research. Predicting emergent properties represents a huge theoretical problem since the presence of SOC implies that the spin is not a good quantum number. Existing theories propose the emergence of a multitude of exotic quantum phases, distinguishable by either local point symmetry breaking or local spin expectation values, even in materials with simple cubic crystal structure such as Ba 2 NaOsO 6. Experimental tests of these theories by local probes are highly sought for. Our local measurements designed to concurrently probe spin and orbital\/lattice degrees of freedom of Ba 2 NaOsO 6 provide such tests. Here we show that a canted ferromagnetic phase which is preceded by local point symmetry breaking is stabilized at low temperatures, as predicted by quantum \u2026",
