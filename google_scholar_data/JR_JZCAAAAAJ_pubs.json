            "Most of the natural processes also take place in the nanometer scale regime. Therefore, a confluence of nanotechnology and biology can address several biomedical problems, and can revolutionize the field of health and medicine [1]. Nanotechnology is currently employed as a tool to explore the darkest avenues of medical sciences in several ways like imaging [2], sensing [3], targeted drug delivery [4] and gene delivery systems [5] and artificial implants [6]. The new age drugs are nanoparticles of polymers, metals or ceramics, which can combat conditions like cancer [7] and fight human pathogens like bacteria [8-12]. The development of new resistant strains of bacteria to current antibiotics [13] has become a serious problem in public health; therefore, there is a strong incentive to develop new bactericides [10]. Bacteria have different membrane structures which allow a general classification of them as Gram-negative or Gram positive. The structural differences lie in the organization of a key component of the membrane, peptidoglycan. Gram negative bacteria exhibit only a thin peptidoglycan layer (~ 2\u20133 nm) between the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane [14]; in contrast, Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane but have a peptidoglycan layer of about 30 nm thick [15].

            "Catharanthus roseus produces a large array of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) that are an important source of natural or semisynthetic anticancer drugs. The biosynthesis of TIAs is tissue specific and induced by certain phytohormones and fungal elicitors, indicating the involvement of a complex transcriptional control network. However, the transcriptional regulation of the TIA pathway is poorly understood. Here, we describe a C. roseus WRKY transcription factor, CrWRKY1, that is preferentially expressed in roots and induced by the phytohormones jasmonate, gibberellic acid, and ethylene. The overexpression of CrWRKY1 in C. roseus hairy roots up-regulated several key TIA pathway genes, especially Tryptophan Decarboxylase (TDC), as well as the transcriptional repressors ZCT1 (for zinc-finger C. roseus transcription factor 1), ZCT2, and ZCT3.

At month 23, copper-alloy surfaces, with inherent antimicrobial properties, were installed onto six monitored objects in 8 of 16 rooms, and the effect that this application had on the intrinsic MB present on the six objects was assessed. Census continued in rooms with and without copper for an additional 21 months.
