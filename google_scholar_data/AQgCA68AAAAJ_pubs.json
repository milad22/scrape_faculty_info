            "Two genuinely quantum mechanical models for an antiferromagnetic linear chain with nearest neighbor interactions are constructed and solved exactly, in the sense that the ground state, all the elementary excitations and the free energy are found. A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short-and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter \u03bb which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 1 2 systems having \u2026",

The first rigorous example of an isotropic model in such a phase is presented. The Hamiltonian has an exact SO(3) symmetry and is translationally invariant, but we prove the model has a unique ground state, a gap in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian immediately above the ground state and exponential decay of the correlation functions in the ground state. Models in two and higher dimension which are expected to have the same properties are also presented. For these models we construct an exact ground state, and for some of them we prove that the two-point function decays exponentially in this ground state. In all these models exact ground states are constructed by using valence bonds.",

We show that he did not solve his model properly because of the paradoxical fact that the density operator commutators , which always vanish for any finite number of particles, no longer vanish in the field-theoretic limit of a filled Dirac sea. In fact the operators  define a boson field which is ipso facto associated with the Fermi\u2013Dirac field. We then use this observation to solve the model, and obtain the exact (and now nontrivial) spectrum, free energy, and dielectric constant. This we also extend to more realistic interactions in an Appendix. We calculate the Fermi surface parameter , and find:  (i.e., there exists a sharp Fermi surface) only in the case of a sufficiently weak interaction.",
