            "So far, one of the fundamental limitations of organic photovoltaic (OPV) device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) has been the low voltage output caused by a molecular orbital mismatch between the donor polymer and acceptor molecules. Here, we present a means of addressing the low voltage output by introducing novel trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes (TNEFs) as acceptor materials for use in photovoltaic devices. TNEFs were discovered in 1999 by Stevenson et al. 1; for the first time derivatives of the TNEF acceptor, Lu 3 N@ C 80, are synthesized and integrated into OPV devices. The reduced energy offset of the molecular orbitals of Lu 3 N@ C 80 to the donor, poly (3-hexyl) thiophene (P3HT), reduces energy losses in the charge transfer process and increases the open circuit voltage (V oc) to 260 mV above reference devices made with [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric methyl ester (C 60-PCBM) acceptor \u2026",

However, devices made via scalable methods are still lagging behind state-of-the-art spin-coated devices because of the complicated nature of perovskite crystallization from a precursor state.

Coupled with antisolvent extraction, this precursor ink delivers high-quality perovskite films with large-scale uniformity.
