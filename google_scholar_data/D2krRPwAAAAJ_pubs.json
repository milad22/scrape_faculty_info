            "The Belle detector was designed and constructed to carry out quantitative studies of rare B-meson decay modes with very small branching fractions using an asymmetric e+ e\u2212 collider operating at the \u03d2 (4S) resonance, the KEK-B-factory. Such studies require data samples containing\u223c 10 7 B-meson decays. The Belle detector is configured around a 1.5 T superconducting solenoid and iron structure surrounding the KEK-B beams at the Tsukuba interaction region. B-meson decay vertices are measured by a silicon vertex detector situated just outside of a cylindrical beryllium beam pipe. Charged particle tracking is performed by a wire drift chamber (CDC). Particle identification is provided by dE\/dx measurements in CDC, aerogel threshold Cherenkov counter and time-of-flight counter placed radially outside of CDC. Electromagnetic showers are detected in an array of CsI (Tl) crystals located inside the solenoid coil \u2026",

From the asymmetry in the distribution of the time intervals between the two B meson decay points, we determine sin 2 \u03c6 1= 0.99\u00b10.14 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst).

The data set is then used to set upper limits at a 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Excited quarks with masses below 6.0 TeV are excluded, and limits are set on quantum black holes, heavy W\u2032 bosons, W* bosons, and a range of masses and couplings in a Z\u2032 dark matter mediator model.
