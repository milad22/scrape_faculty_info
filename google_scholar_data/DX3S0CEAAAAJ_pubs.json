Individual electrons are laterally confined by micrometer-sized metal pads below the helium. Information is stored in the lowest hydrogenic levels. With electric fields, at temperatures of 10\u22122 kelvin, changes in the wave function can be made in nanoseconds. Wave function coherence times are 0.1 millisecond. The wave function is read out with an inverted dc voltage, which releases excited electrons from the surface.",

Key to these experiments is the ability to measure weak forces. Here, we report on force sensing experiments with a sensitivity of 12 zN Hz\u2212 1\/2 at a temperature of 1.2 K using a resonator made of a carbon nanotube. An ultrasensitive method based on cross-correlated electrical noise measurements, in combination with parametric downconversion, is used to detect the low-amplitude vibrations of the nanotube induced by weak forces. The force sensitivity is quantified by applying a known capacitive force. This detection method also allows us to measure the Brownian vibrations of the nanotube down to cryogenic temperatures.

For both autocatalytic and nonautocatalytic reactions, the analysis of the distribution about a stable stationary state and of the transitions between coexisting stable states comes, to logarithmic accuracy, to the analysis of Hamiltonian dynamics of an auxiliary dynamical system. The latter can be done explicitly in a few cases, including one\u2010species systems, systems with detailed balance, and systems close to the bifurcation points where the number of the stable states changes. In the last case, the fluctuations display universal features, and, for saddle\u2010node bifurcation points, the logarithm of the probability of escape from the metastable state (per unit time) is proportional to the \u2026",

It is shown that in the first case the transition probability depends exponentially on 1\/T. As an example, transitions between the states of a nonlinear oscillator in the field of an external resonance force are considered. The calculation of the activation energy reduces to the solution of a variational problem. In the most interesting extreme cases explicit analytic expressions for the activation energy are derived, and its dependence on the parameters of the oscillator are analyzed. Characteristics of the absorption of an additional weak field are investigated, and also those of the absorption of the main field.",
