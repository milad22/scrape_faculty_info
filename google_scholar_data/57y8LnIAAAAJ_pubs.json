            "Hexagonal YMnO 3 shows a unique improper ferroelectricity induced by structural trimerization. Extensive research on this system is primarily due to its candidacy for ferroelectric memory as well as the intriguing coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism. Despite this research, the true ferroelectric domain structure and its relationship with structural domains have never been revealed. Using transmission electron microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, we observed an intriguing conductive \u2018cloverleaf\u2019pattern of six domains emerging from one point\u2014all distinctly characterized by polarization orientation and structural antiphase relationships. In addition, we discovered that the ferroelectric domain walls and structural antiphase boundaries are mutually locked and this strong locking results in incomplete poling even when large electric fields are applied. Furthermore, the locked walls are found to be \u2026",

            "Discoveries of intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism in van der Waals (vdW) crystals provide an interesting arena for studying fundamental 2D magnetism and devices that employ localized spins 1, 2, 3, 4. However, an exfoliable vdW material that exhibits intrinsic 2D itinerant magnetism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT), an exfoliable vdW magnet, exhibits robust 2D ferromagnetism with strong perpendicular anisotropy when thinned down to a monolayer. Layer-number-dependent studies reveal a crossover from 3D to 2D Ising ferromagnetism for thicknesses less than 4 nm (five layers), accompanied by a fast drop of the Curie temperature (T C) from 207 K to 130 K in the monolayer. For FGT flakes thicker than~ 15 nm, a distinct magnetic behaviour emerges in an intermediate temperature range, which we show is due to the formation of labyrinthine domain patterns.

            "Spin glasses are founded in the frustration and randomness of microscopic magnetic interactions. They are non-ergodic systems where replica symmetry is broken. Although magnetic glassy behaviour has been observed in many colossal magnetoresistive manganites, there is no consensus that they are spin glasses. Here, an intriguing glass transition in (La, Pr, Ca) MnO 3 is imaged using a variable-temperature magnetic force microscope. In contrast to the speculated spin-glass picture, our results show that the observed static magnetic configuration seen below the glass-transition temperature arises from the cooperative freezing of the first-order antiferromagnetic (charge ordered) to ferromagnetic transition. Our data also suggest that accommodation strain is important in the kinetics of the phase transition.

In addition to previously observed Schottky-like rectification at low bias [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 217601 (2010)], conductance spectra reveal that negatively charged tail-to-tail walls exhibit enhanced conduction at high forward bias, while positively charged head-to-head walls exhibit suppressed conduction at high reverse bias.

The polar structure of these films are found to persist up to 1050 K; and the switchability of the polar behavior is observed at room temperature, indicating ferroelectricity. An antiferromagnetic order was shown to occur below 440 K, followed by a spin reorientation resulting in a weak ferromagnetic order below 130 K.

Here we combine first-principles calculations, group-theoretic techniques and microscopic spin models to show how the trimerization not only induces a polarization (P) but also a bulk M and bulk magnetoelectric (ME) effect. This results in the existence of a bulk linear ME vortex structure or a bulk ME coupling such that if P reverses so does M. To measure the predicted ME vortex, we suggest RMnO 3 under large magnetic field. We suggest a family of materials, the hexagonal RFeO 3 ferrites, also display the predicted phenomena in their ground state.",
