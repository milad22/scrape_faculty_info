These data reveal a series of concentric ring-shaped substructures in the form of bright zones and narrow dark annuli (1\u20136 au) with modest contrasts (5%\u201330%). We associate these features with concentrations of solids that have had their inward radial drift slowed or stopped, presumably at local gas pressure maxima. No significant non-axisymmetric structures are detected. Some of the observed features occur near temperatures that may be associated with the condensation fronts of major volatile species, but the relatively small brightness contrasts may also be a consequence of magnetized disk evolution (the so-called zonal flows).

            "In this chapter we will discuss the evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks, focusing on the processes of grain growth and the observational consequences of this process. In the standard scenario for planet formation, this is the phase in which the solids grow from micrometer-sized particles, which are present in the molecular cloud cores out of which stars and protoplanetary disks are formed, to centimeter-sized and beyond on the path to become planetesimals. This is the last stage of solid growth that is directly observable before the formation of large, planetary-sized bodies that can be individually observed. As this phase of growth is directly observable, it has the potential of setting strong constraints on the initial stages of the planet-formation process. In this review, we focus on the growth of particles on the disk mid-plane, as this is where most of the solid mass of the disk is concentrated and where planets are expected to form. Grain growth in the disk inner regions and atmosphere can be effectively investigated in the IR and have been extensively reviewed in Natta et al.(2007), although at the time of that review the observational evidence and theoretical understanding of the global dust evolution processes in the disk were limited. This phase of growth up to centimeter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks can also be connected to the study of the most pristine solids in our own solar system. We can directly follow grain growth in the solar nebula through the study of primitive rocky meteorites known as chondrites. Chondrites are composed mainly of millimeter-sized, spherical chondrules with an admixture of smaller, irregularly shaped calcium \u2026",

The maps of the CO 12, CO 13, and C O 18 J= 2\u2212 1 emission do not show such structures but reveal a change in the slope of the radial intensity profile across the positions of the dark rings in the continuum image.

However, previous observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms.

We argue that the rim shape is controlled by a fundamental property of circumstellar disks, namely their very large vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain evaporation temperature on gas density. As a result, the bright side of the rim is curved, rather than vertical, as expected when a constant evaporation temperature is assumed. We have computed a number of rim models that take into account this effect in a self-consistent way. The results show that the curved rim (as the vertical rim) emits most of its radiation in the near and mid-IR, and provides a simple explanation for the observed values of the near-IR excess (the \u201c3 \u03bcm bump\u201d of Herbig Ae stars). Contrary to the vertical rim, for curved rims the near-IR excess does not depend much on the inclination, being maximum for face-on \u2026",
