            "The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been completely sequenced through a worldwide collaboration. The sequence of 12,068 kilobases defines 5885 potential protein-encoding genes, approximately 140 genes specifying ribosomal RNA, 40 genes for small nuclear RNA molecules, and 275 transfer RNA genes. In addition, the complete sequence provides information about the higher order organization of yeast9s 16 chromosomes and allows some insight into their evolutionary history. The genome shows a considerable amount of apparent genetic redundancy, and one of the major problems to be tackled during the next stage of the yeast genome project is to elucidate the biological functions of all of these genes.",

            "Since the completion of the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 (refs 1, 2), there has been a large increase in complete genome sequences, accompanied by great advances in our understanding of genome evolution. Although little is known about the natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and geographic distributions 3, 4, population structure 5, 6, 7, 8 and sexual versus asexual reproduction 9, 10. Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within populations and species that lead to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation. Here we present one-to fourfold or more coverage of the genome sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker\u2019s yeast S. cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We examine variation in \u2026",

To test the hypothesis that the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of topo II is necessary for mediating interactions with other proteins required for chromosome segregation, we used a two-hybrid cloning strategy to identify proteins that interact with S. cerevisiae topo II in vivo. One protein identified (Sgs1p) is structurally related to E. coli RecQ protein and contains helicase signature motifs. Strains lacking Sgs1p exhibit elevated levels of chromosome missegregation during both mitotic and meiotic division. We propose a model to account for the interaction of a toposomerase and a helicase in the faithful segregation of newly replicated eukaryotic chromosomes.",

Bloom9s and Werner9s syndrome cell lines both exhibit chromosomal instability. sgsl\u0394 strains show mitotic hyperrecombination, as do Bloom9s cells. This was manifested as an increase in the frequency of interchromosomal homologous recombination, intrachromosomal excision recombination, and ectopic recombination.
