            "Science and technologies based on terahertz frequency electromagnetic radiation (100 GHz\u201330 THz) have developed rapidly over the last 30 years. For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to'real world'applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the \u2026",

Efforts to integrate femtosecond lasers with scanning tunnelling microscopes (STMs) 3 have yielded a number of ultrafast STM techniques 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, but the basic ability to directly modulate the STM junction bias while maintaining nanometre spatial resolution has been limited to\u223c 10 ps (refs 7, 8) and has required specialized probe or sample structures. Here, without any modification to the STM design, we modulate the STM junction bias by coupling terahertz pulses to the scanning probe tip of an STM and demonstrate terahertz-pulse-induced tunnelling in an STM. The terahertz STM (THz-STM) provides simultaneous subpicosecond (< 500 fs) time resolution and nanometre (2 nm) imaging resolution under ambient laboratory conditions, and can directly image ultrafast carrier \u2026",

But tracking the intrinsic dynamics of a single molecule directly in the time domain faces the challenge that interactions with the molecule must be confined to a femtosecond time window. For individual nanoparticles, such ultrafast temporal confinement has been demonstrated 18 by combining scanning tunnelling \u2026",

Based on the observed thresholds for characteristic transient terahertz dynamics, a phase diagram of critical pump fluence versus temperature for the insulator-metal phase transition in VO 2 is established for the first time over a broad range of temperatures down to 17 K. We find that both Mott and Peierls mechanisms are present in the insulating state and that the photoinduced transition is nonthermal. We propose a critical-threshold model for the ultrafast photoinduced transition based on a critical density of electrons and a critical density of coherently excited phonons necessary for the structural transition to the metallic state. As a result, evidence is found at low temperatures for an intermediate metallic state \u2026",

A simple model of the electron transport dynamics shows that the observed nonlinear response is due to THz-electric- field-induced intervalley scattering over sub-picosecond time scales as well as an increase in the intravalley scattering rate attributed to carrier heating. Furthermore, the nonlinear nature of the THz pulse transmission at high peak fields leads to a measured terahertz conductivity in the photoexcited GaAs that deviates significantly from the Drude behavior observed at low THz fields, emphasizing the need to explore nonlinear THz pulse interactions with materials in the time domain.",

In films with silicon filling fractions above the percolation threshold, we observe a transition from long-range internanocrystal transport immediately after photoexcitation to increased carrier localization over a 50-ps time scale due to accumulation of charges at interface defect sites. However, in films with silicon filling fractions below the percolation threshold, transport between nanocrystals is strongly suppressed at all times.
