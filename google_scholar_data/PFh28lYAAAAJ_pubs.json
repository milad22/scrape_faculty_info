Eligibility included smear-positive filamentous fungal ulcer and visual acuity of 20\/40 to 20\/400.Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome was best spectacle-corrected visual acuity at 3 months; secondary outcomes included corneal perforation and\/or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty.ResultsA total of 940 patients were screened and 323 were enrolled. Causative organisms included Fusarium (128 patients [40%]), Aspergillus (54 patients [17%]), and other filamentous fungi (141 patients [43%]).

Multivariate analysis was used to determine the effect of predictors, organism, and treatment on outcomes, 3-month best-spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), and infiltrate\/scar size. The incidence of adverse events over a 3-month follow-up period was compared using Fisher's exact test.Results.: SCUT enrolled 500 patients. One hundred ten patients had P. aeruginosa ulcers; 99 of 110 (90%) enrolled patients returned for follow-up at 3 months. Patients with P. aeruginosa ulcers had significantly worse visual acuities than patients with other bacterial ulcers (P= 0.001) but showed significantly more improvement in 3-month BSCVA than those with other bacterial ulcers, adjusting for baseline characteristics (\u2212 0.14 logMAR; 95% confidence interval,\u2212 0.23 to\u2212 0.04; P= 0.004). There was no significant difference in adverse events between P. aeruginosa and other bacterial ulcers. There were no significant differences in BSCVA (P= 0.69), infiltrate\/scar size (P= 0.17), and incidence of adverse events between patients with P. aeruginosa ulcers treated with adjunctive corticosteroids and patients given placebo.Conclusions.: Although P. aeruginosa corneal ulcers \u2026",
