Measurements of force and extension on single molecules of DNA 1, 2, 3 have allowed direct determination of the molecule's mechanical properties, provided rigorous tests of theories of polymer elasticity 4, revealed unforeseen structural transitions induced by mechanical stresses 3, 5, 6, 7, and established an experimental and conceptual framework for mechanical assays of enzymes that act on DNA 8.

We used replicate laboratory populations of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for direct observation of critical slowing down before population collapse. We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point. Fluctuations of population density increased in size and duration near the tipping point, in agreement with the theory. Our results suggest that indicators of critical slowing down can provide advance warning of catastrophic thresholds and loss of resilience in a variety of dynamical systems.",

We used rotor bead tracking to directly measure twist\u2013stretch coupling in single DNA molecules. Here we show that for small distortions, contrary to intuition, DNA overwinds under tension, reaching a maximum twist at a tension of\u223c 30 pN. As tension is increased above this critical value, the DNA begins to unwind.

Despite the many applications of the Jarzynski estimator, its behavior is only poorly understood. In this article we derive the large N limit for the Jarzynski estimator bias, variance, and mean square error that is correct for arbitrary perturbations. We then analyze the properties of the Jarzynski estimator for all N when the probability distribution of work values is \u2026",

Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable community, whose composition was independent of the initial species fractions.

On three natural substrates, independent of its initial binding position, FtsK efficiently translocates over long distances to the terminal region of the E. coli chromosome, as it does in vivo.
