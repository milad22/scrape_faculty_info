            "Since its introduction (independently by Mayer, and by Haxel, Jensen, and Suess) in the early 1950s the nuclear shell model has played a central role in the understanding of nuclear structure. Beginning with extreme single-particle motion in spherical potentials, only the addition of relatively strong spin-orbit coupling was required to permit reproduction of a wealth of data for nuclei near the nuclear magic numbers-near closed nuclear shells. With the pioneering work of Bohr and Mottelson a few years later it was recognized that nonspherical nuclear shapes, hence potentials, were characteristic of the regions between magic numbers and the Nilsson model. Much used by experimentalists was the corresponding independent particle shell model based on spheroidal potentials. It, too, was remarkably successful in reproducing nuclear data. It was soon evident that the independent particle assumption was too \u2026",

            "The principle of the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass is one of the cornerstones of general relativity. Considerable efforts have been made and are still being made to verify its validity. A quantum-mechanical formulation of gravity allows for non-Newtonian contributions to the force which might lead to a difference in the gravitational force on matter and antimatter. While it is widely expected that the gravitational interaction of matter and of antimatter should be identical, this assertion has never been tested experimentally. With the production of large amounts of cold antihydrogen at the CERN Antiproton Decelerator, such a test with neutral antimatter atoms has now become feasible. For this purpose, we have proposed to set up the AEGIS experiment at CERN\/AD, whose primary goal will be the direct measurement of the Earth\u2019s gravitational acceleration on antihydrogen with a classical Moir\u00e9 deflectometer.",

            "The measurement of radioactivity by direct conversion of nuclear radiation into a temperature rise of a calorimeter is as old as nuclear physics itself. As part of a general programme aiming at a determination of the mass of the electron neutrino, we have designed an improved version of a He-cooled composite diamond bolometer with a monolithic germanium thermistor, developed at the Laboratoire de Physique Stellaire et Planetaire (LPSP)1. Our approach, based on an idea by De Rujula2, is to study the shape, near the upper end-point of the internal bremsstrahlung spectrum in electron-capture \u03b2 decay. The best nucleus for a precise measurement seems to be 163Ho, for which we have determined3 the QEC value to be 2.83\u00b10.05 keV. A particularly interesting possibility is to use total absorption spectrometry4 (calorimetry), in which the radioactive holmium forms part of the sensitive volume of the detector \u2026",

Direct generation of the excited state on the nanocrystal result in eliminating competing processes that have previously led to the low reported efficiencies in near-infrared light emitting devices. Furthermore, the emission wavelength can be tuned to cover a wide range of wavelengths including the 1.3\u20131.5\u03bcm region without significant change of the efficiency.",

The isotopes were produced by p, yn reactions on Au 197. Approximately 0.01 \u03bcg of Hg was transferred into the rf-excited electrodeless light sources. A well-blazed plane diffraction grating, 25 cm wide, was used in the multiple wavelength monochromator of 11 m focal length for these high-resolution optical hfs measurements. These lead to the results I= 1 2 for Hg 195, I= 13 2 for Hg 195m and Hg 193m; \u03bc=\u2212 1.05, 0.53,\u2212 1.04 nm for Hg 193m, Hg 195, Hg 195m; Q= 1.37, 1.41 b for Hg 193m, Hg 195m; with respect to Hg 198, IS= 0.441\u00b10.020, 0.368\u00b10.006, 0.284\u00b10.007, 0.214\u00b10.008, 0.220\u00b10.005 cm\u2212 1 for Hg 192, Hg 193m, Hg 194, Hg 195 and Hg 195m.
