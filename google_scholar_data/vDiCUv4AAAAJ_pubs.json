We report the solution-phase growth of single- and few-unit-cell-thick single-crystalline 2D hybrid perovskites of (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 with well-defined square shape and large size. In contrast to other 2D materials, the hybrid perovskite sheets exhibit an unusual structural relaxation, and this structural change leads to a band gap shift as compared to the bulk crystal. The high-quality 2D crystals exhibit efficient photoluminescence, and color tuning could be achieved by changing sheet thickness as well as composition via the synthesis of related materials.",

For instance, mixed halide hybrid perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronics, yet bulk measurements suggest the halides reversibly phase separate upon photoexcitation. By combining nanoscale imaging and multiscale modeling, we find that the nature of halide demixing in these materials is distinct from macroscopic phase separation. We propose that the localized strain induced by a single photoexcited charge interacting with the soft, ionic lattice is sufficient to promote halide phase separation and nucleate a light-stabilized, low-bandgap, \u223c8 nm iodide-rich cluster. The limited extent of this polaron is essential to promote demixing because by contrast bulk strain would simply be relaxed \u2026",

We apply two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to examine energy flow in LHCII. This technique allows for direct mapping of excitation energy pathways as a function of absorption and emission wavelength. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that excitation energy transfers through the complex on three time scales: previously unobserved sub-100 fs relaxation through spatially overlapping states, several hundred femtosecond transfer between nearby chlorophylls, and picosecond energy transfer steps between layers of pigments.

Their structure\u2212function relationships are often far from obvious.

Understanding and subsequently mimicking the processes in photosynthesis, for example, will set the stage for considerable advances in using light harvesting to fuel renewable energy technologies.Two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy is emerging as a nonlinear optical technique that provides significant insight into the interactions and dynamics of complex molecular systems.

The complexity of the electronic structure and energy transfer pathways within networks of photosynthetic pigment\u2013protein complexes often obscures the mechanisms behind the efficient light-absorption-to-charge conversion process. Recent experiments, particularly using two-dimensional spectroscopy, have detected long-lived quantum coherence, which theory suggests may contribute to the effectiveness of photosynthetic energy transfer. Here, we present a new, direct method to access coherence signals: a coherence-specific polarization sequence, which isolates the excitonic coherence features from the population signals that usually dominate two-dimensional spectra. With this polarization sequence, we elucidate coherent dynamics and determine the overall measurable lifetime of excitonic coherence in the major light-harvesting \u2026",
