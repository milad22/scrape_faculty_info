            "Characterizing out-of-equilibrium many-body dynamics is a complex but crucial task for quantum applications and understanding fundamental phenomena. A central question is the role of localization in quenching thermalization in many-body systems and whether such localization survives in the presence of interactions. Probing this question in real systems necessitates the development of an experimentally measurable metric that can distinguish between different types of localization. While it is known that the localized phase of interacting systems [many-body localization (MBL)] exhibits a long-time logarithmic growth in entanglement entropy that distinguishes it from the noninteracting case of Anderson localization (AL), entanglement entropy is difficult to measure experimentally. Here, we present a novel correlation metric, capable of distinguishing MBL from AL in high-temperature spin systems. We demonstrate \u2026",

This paradigm of control has important applications for spin based solid-state quantum information processing. In particular we argue that indirect addressing of the nuclear spins via an electron spin acting as a spin actuator allows for nuclear spin quantum logic gates whose operational times are significantly faster than either gates based on rf fields resonant with nuclear spin flips or nuclear-nuclear dipolar interactions. We demonstrate experimental aspects of this method with one electron and one nuclear spin of a single crystal of irradiated malonic acid.",

A single target spin is coupled via the magnetic dipolar interaction to a large ensemble of spins. Applying radio frequency pulses, we can control the evolution so that the spin ensemble reaches one of two orthogonal states whose collective properties differ depending on the state of the target spin and are easily measured. We first describe this measurement process using quantum gates; then we show how equivalent schemes can be defined in terms of the Hamiltonian and thus implemented under conditions of real control, using well established NMR techniques.

Experimental studies by NMR in solid state spin systems (a natural implementation of such models) is complicated since the dipolar Hamiltonian is not solely comprised of nearest-neighbor X Y-Heisenberg couplings. We present here a similarity transformation between the X Y Hamiltonian and the double-quantum Hamiltonian, an interaction which is achievable with the collective control provided by radio-frequency pulses. Not only can this second Hamiltonian simulate the information transport in a spin chain, but it also creates coherent states, whose intensities give an experimental signature of the transport. This scheme makes it possible to study experimentally the transport of polarization beyond exactly solvable models and explore the appearance of quantum coherence and interference effects.",

The technique was applied to a thoraxlike phantom with regions simulating lung, background and cardiac regions, and bone. SPECT images reconstructed with no attenuation correction, or with a uniform water-equivalent map, contained increased count levels in the lung region and reduced count levels in the cardiac region as compared with the radioactivity concentrations contained in the phantom.

In order to probe the multiple-spin dynamics during the FID, we measured the growth of coherence orders in a basis other than the usual Zeeman eigenbasis.
