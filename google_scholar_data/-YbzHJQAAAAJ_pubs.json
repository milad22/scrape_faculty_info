            "Increasing biomedical applications of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in academic and commercial settings have alarmed the scientific community about the safety and assessment of toxicity profiles of IONPs. The great amount of diversity found in the cytotoxic measurements of IONPs points toward the necessity of careful characterization and quantification of IONPs. The present document discusses the major developments related to in vitro and in vivo toxicity assessment of IONPs and its relationship with the physicochemical parameters of IONPs. Major discussion is included on the current spectrophotometric and imaging based techniques used for quantifying, and studying the clearance and biodistribution of IONPs. Several invasive and non-invasive quantification techniques along with the pitfalls are discussed in detail. Finally, critical guidelines are provided to optimize the design of IONPs to minimize the toxicity. View Full-Text",

Chemical bonding, crystal structure and magnetic properties of CFGO compounds have been evaluated as a function of Gd-content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of inverse spinel cubic structure. However, a secondary ortho-ferrite phase (GdFeO3) nucleates for higher values of Gd-content. A considerable increase in the saturation magnetization has been observed upon the initial substitution of Gd (x = 0.1). The saturation magnetization drastically decreases at higher Gd content (x \u2a7e 0.3). No contribution from ortho-ferrite GdFeO3 phase is noted to the magnetic properties. The increase in the magnetic saturation magnetization is attributed to the higher magnetic moment of Gd3+ (4f7) residing in \u2026",

The proposed reaction protocol is simple, rapid, and highly versatile because it takes advantage of the multiple roles of the oleyl alcohol molecules, namely, solvent for the precursors, reaction medium, and capping ligand for the metal oxide nanoparticles. A systematic FT-IR spectroscopy study has indicated that the transition-metal ferrite nanoparticles are precipitated in oleyl alcohol solutions via a thermal decomposition process with no evidence about a potential esterification reaction, involving the long-chain alcohol and the metal acetate salt. A detailed characterization of the oleyl alcohol capped ferrite nanoparticles was performed by XRD, TEM, SAED, EXAFS, FT-IR, and SQUID \u2026",

When NP samples with different sizes are reacted, clear evidence for size selectivity is seen. Magnetic dipolar interactions between ferrite NPs within the Fe3O4@hexaniobate samples lead to significant rise in coercivity, increasing almost fourfold relative to free particles. Other magnetic ferrites NPPs, MFe2O4@hexaniobate (M = Mn, Co, Ni), can also be prepared.
