            "The roughness of intraoral hard surfaces can influence bacterial plague retention. The present review evaluates the initial surface roughness of several intraoral hard materials, as well as changes in this surface roughness as a consequence of different treatment modalities.Articles found through Medline searches were included in this review if they met the following criteria: 1) stated threshold surface roughness values and reputed change in surface roughness due to different manipulation techniques; or 2) included standardized surface conditions that could be compared to the treated surface.Recently, some in vivo studies suggested a threshold surface roughness for bacterial retention (Ra = 0.2 \u03bcm) below which no further reduction in bacterial accumulation could be expected. An increase in surface roughness above this threshold roughness, however, resulted in a simultaneous \u2026",

            " In the oral cavity, an open growth system, bacterial adhesion to the non\u2010shedding surfaces is for most bacteria the only way to survive. This adhesion occurs in 4 phases: the transport of the bacterium to the surface, the initial adhesion with a reversible and irreversible stage, the attachment by specific interactions, and finally the colonization in order to form a biofilm. Different hard surfaces are available in the oral cavity (teeth, filling materials, dental implants, or prostheses), all with different surface characteristics. In a healthy situation, a dynamic equilibrium exists on these surfaces between the forces of retention and those of removal. However, an increased bacterial accumulation often results in a shift toward disease. 2 mechanisms favour the retention of dental plaque: adhesion and stagnation. The aim of this review is to examine the influence of the surface roughness and the surface free energy in the adhesion \u2026",

            "Background:  From an ecological viewpoint, the oral cavity, in fact the oro\u2010pharynx, is an \u2018open growth system\u2019. It undergoes an uninterrupted introduction and removal of both microorganisms and nutrients. In order to survive within the oro\u2010pharyngeal area, bacteria need to adhere either to the soft or hard tissues in order to resist shear forces. The fast turn\u2010over of the oral lining epithelia (shedding 3 \u00d7\/day) is an efficient defence mechanism as it prevents the accumulation of large masses of microorganisms. Teeth, dentures, or endosseous implants, however, providing non\u2010shedding surfaces, allow the formation of thick biofilms. In general, the established biofilm maintains an equilibrium with the host. An uncontrolled accumulation and\/or metabolism of bacteria on the hard surfaces forms, however, the primary cause of dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, peri\u2010implantitis, and stomatitis.Objectives:  This systematic \u2026",

            " The use of oral implants in the rehabilitation of partially and fully edentulous patients is widely accepted even though failures do occur. The chance for implants to integrate can for example be jeopardised by the intra\u2010oral presence of bacteria and concomitant inflammatory reactions. The longevity of osseointegrated implants can be compromised by occlusal overload and\/or plaque\u2010induced peri\u2010implantitis, depending on the implant geometry and surface characteristics. Animal studies, cross\u2010sectional and longitudinal observations in man, as well as association studies indicate that peri\u2010implantitis is characterised by a microbiota comparable to that of periodontitis (high proportion of anaerobic Gram\u2010negative rods, motile organisms and spirochetes), but this does not necessarily prove a causal relationship. However, in order to prevent such a bacterial shift, the following measures can be considered: periodontal \u2026",

            "In a standard periodontal treatment strategy with consecutive root planings (per quadrant at a one- to two-week interval), re-infection of a disinfected area might occur before completion of the treatment. This study examines, both clinically and microbiologically, whether a full-mouth disinfection within 24 hours significantly improves the outcome of periodontal treatment. Ten patients with advanced chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to a test and a control group. The patients from the control group received scalings and root planings as well as oral hygiene instructions per quadrant at two-week intervals. Full-mouth disinfection in the test group was sought by the removal of all plaque and calculus (in two visits within 24 hours). In addition, at each of these visits, the tongue was brushed with a 1 % chlorhexidine gel for one min and the mouth rinsed with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution for two min. Furthermore \u2026",

            "In nine patients with fixed prostheses supported by endosseous titanium implants, 2 titanium abutments (trans-mucosal part of the implant) were replaced by either an unused standard abutment or a roughened titanium abutment. After 3 months of habitual oral hygiene, plaque samples were taken for differential phase-contrast microscopy, DNA probe analysis, and culturing.Supragingivally, rough abutments harbored significantly fewer coccoid micro-organisms (64 us. 81%), which is indicative of a more mature plaque. Subgingivally, the observations depended on the sampling procedure. For plaque collected with paper points, only minor qualitative and quantitative differences between both substrata could be registered. However, when the microbiota adhering to the abutment were considered, rough surfaces harbored 25 times more bacteria, with a slightly lower density of coccoid organisms. The presence and \u2026",

Focused questions on the characteristics of peri\u2010implant health, peri\u2010implant mucositis, peri\u2010implantitis, and soft\u2010 and hard\u2010tissue deficiencies were addressed.Peri\u2010implant health is characterized by the absence of erythema, bleeding on probing, swelling, and suppuration. It is not possible to define a range of probing depths compatible with health; Peri\u2010implant health can exist around implants with reduced bone support.The main clinical characteristic of peri\u2010implant mucositis is bleeding on gentle probing. Erythema, swelling, and\/or suppuration may also be present. An increase in probing depth is often observed in the presence of peri\u2010implant mucositis due to swelling or decrease in probing resistance. There is strong evidence from animal and human experimental studies that plaque is the etiological factor for peri\u2010implant mucositis.Peri \u2026",
