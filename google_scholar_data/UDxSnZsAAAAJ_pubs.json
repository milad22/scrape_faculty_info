Under steady state conditions, with a constant oscillatory driving force at the resonant frequency, the waves are turbulent and there are fluxes of energy towards both high and low frequencies. Rogue waves appear under the nonequilibrium conditions that prevail shortly after the drive has been switched on, prior to establishment of the steady state. The experiment is described briefly, relevant results are presented and discussed theoretically in terms of nonlinear wave interactions, and possible connections to rogue waves on the ocean are considered.

Under mechanical stress, the labile bonds between the nanogels can break and readily re-form with reactive groups on neighboring units. This breaking and re-forming allows the units in the network to undergo a structural rearrangement that preserves the mechanical integrity of the sample. The simulations show that just a small fraction of labile bonds leads to a roughly 25% increase in the stress needed to induce fracture. Thus, the labile bonds can significantly improve the tensile strength of the material. The findings provide guidelines for creating high-strength, self-healing materials.",

We find that decay begins from the high frequency end of the spectral range, while most of the energy remains localized at low frequencies. The apparent discrepancy with the self-similar theory of nonstationary wave turbulent processes is accounted for in terms of a quasiadiabatic decay wherein fast nonlinear wave interactions redistribute energy between frequency scales in the presence of finite damping at all frequencies.

Initially focusing on a simple shear flow, we isolate conditions where the microcapsules become arrested in the cracks and those where the capsules enter the cracks for a finite time but are driven to leave this region by the imposed flow. We also characterize the particle deposition process for these two scenarios, showing that the deposition is greater for the arrested capsules.
