            "The refractive index of GaAs has been measured in the wavelength range from 0.97 to 17 \u03bcm, which covers nearly the entire transmission range of the material. Linear and quadratic temperature coefficients of the refractive index have been fitted to data measured between room temperature and 95\u200a\u00b0C. In the midinfrared, the refractive index and temperature dependence are obtained from analysis of etalon fringes measured by Fourier-transform spectroscopy in undoped GaAs wafers. In the near infrared, the refractive index is deduced from the quasiphasematching (QPM) wavelengths of second-harmonic generation in orientation-patterned GaAs crystals. Two alternative empirical expressions are fitted to the data to give the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature. These dispersion relations agree with observed QPM conditions for midinfrared difference-frequency generation and second \u2026",

The OPO utilizes an all-epitaxially-grown orientation-patterned GaAs crystal that is 0.5 mm thick, 5 mm wide, and 11 mm long, with a domain reversal period of 61.2 \u00b5m. Tuning either the near-IR pump wavelength between 1.8 and 2 \u00b5m or the temperature of the GaAs crystal allows the mid-IR output to be tuned between 2.28 and 9.14 \u00b5m, which is limited only by the spectral range of the OPO mirrors. The pump threshold of the singly resonant OPO is 16 \u00b5J for the 6-ns pump pulses, and the photon conversion slope efficiency reaches 54%.

The dispersion tolerances, in these systems, are small enough that sources of dispersion variation, that are negligible in slower systems, become critically important to network performance. At these high-bit rates, active dispersion compensation modules may be required to respond dynamically to changes occurring in the network, such as variations in the per-channel power, reconfigurations of the channel's path that are caused by add-drop operations, and environmental changes, such as changes in ambient temperature. We present a comprehensive discussion of an emerging tunable dispersion compensating device, based on thermally actuated fiber gratings.

Therefore, when light circulates about the axis, as in GaAs whispering-gallery-mode microdisks, it encounters effective domain inversions that can produce quasi-phasematching. Microdisk resonators also offer resonant field enhancement, resulting in highly efficient frequency conversion in micrometre-scale volumes. These devices can be integrated in photonic circuits as compact frequency convertors, sources of radiation or entangled photons.

            "We have efficiently generated tunable terahertz (THz) radiation using intracavity parametric down-conversion in gallium arsenide (GaAs). We used three types of microstructured GaAs to quasi-phase-match the interaction: optically contacted, orientation-patterned, and diffusion-bonded GaAs. The GaAs was placed in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) cavity, and the THz wave was generated by difference-frequency mixing between the OPO signal and idler waves. The OPO used type-II phase-matched periodically poled lithium niobate as a gain medium and was synchronously pumped by a mode-locked laser at 1064 nm (7 ps and 200 nJ at 50 MHz). With center frequencies spanning 0.4-3.5 THz, 250-GHz bandwidth radiation was generated. We measured two orders of optical cascading generated by the mixing of optical and THz waves. In a doubly resonant oscillator (DRO) configuration, the efficiency \u2026",
