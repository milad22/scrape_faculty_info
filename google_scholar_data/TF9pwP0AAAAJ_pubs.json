            "Feshbach resonances are the essential tool to control the interaction between atoms in ultracold quantum gases. They have found numerous experimental applications, opening up the way to important breakthroughs. This review broadly covers the phenomenon of Feshbach resonances in ultracold gases and their main applications. This includes the theoretical background and models for the description of Feshbach resonances, the experimental methods to find and characterize the resonances, a discussion of the main properties of resonances in various atomic species and mixed atomic species systems, and an overview of key experiments with atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, degenerate Fermi gases, and ultracold molecules.",

            "Photoassociation is the process in which two colliding atoms absorb a photon to form an excited molecule. The development of laser-cooling techniques for producing gases at ultracold (< 1 mK) temperatures allows photoassociation spectroscopy to be performed with very high spectral resolution. Of particular interest is the investigation of molecular states whose properties can be related, with high precision, to the properties of their constituent atoms with the \u201ccomplications\u201d of chemical binding accounted for by a few parameters. These include bound long-range or purely long-range vibrational states in which two atoms spend most or all of their time at large internuclear separations. Low-energy atomic scattering states also share this characteristic. Photoassociation techniques have made important contributions to the study of all of these. This review describes what is special about photoassociation spectroscopy \u2026",

We pay special attention to atoms in the f= 3, m f=-3 weak-field seeking state of the lower hyperfine manifold. The cross sections show a pronounced resonance structure. We discuss its origin, starting from the pure bound singlet and triplet rovibrational Cs 2 states and introducing perturbations due to the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions. We also discuss the role of the centrifugal barrier in the final collision channel in reducing the loss of atoms from the trap due to transitions induced by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.",
