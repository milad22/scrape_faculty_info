            "We describe the growth of hexagonal GaN on Si(111) by gas source molecular beam epitaxy with ammonia. The initial deposition of Al, at 1130\u20131190 K, resulted in a very rapid transition to a two-dimensional growth mode of AlN. The rapid transition is essential for the subsequent growth of high quality GaN and AlGaN. This procedure also resulted in complete elimination of cracking in thick (>2 \u03bcm) GaN layers. For layers thicker than 1.5 \u03bcm, the full width at half maximum of the (0002) GaN diffraction peak was less than 14 arc sec. We show that a short period superlattice of AlGaN\/GaN grown on the AlN buffer can be used to block defects propagating through GaN, resulting in good crystal and luminescence quality. At room temperature, the linewidth of the GaN exciton recombination peak was less than 40 meV, typical of the best samples grown on sapphire.",

            "We study the vibrational spectrum of AlN grown on Si (111). The AlN was deposited using gas-source molecular beam epitaxy. Raman backscattering along the growth c axis and from a cleaved surface perpendicular to the wurtzite c direction allows us to determine the E 2 1, E 2 2, A 1 (TO), A 1 (LO), and E 1 (TO) phonon energies. For a 0.8-\u03bcm-thick AlN layer under a biaxial tensile stress of 0.6 GPa, these are 249.0, 653.6, 607.3, 884.5, and 666.5 cm\u2212 1, respectively. By combining the Raman and x-ray diffraction studies, the Raman stress factor of AlN is found to be\u2212 6.3\u00b11.4 cm\u2212 1\/GPa for the E 2 2 phonon. This factor depends on published values of the elastic constants of AlN, as discussed in the text. The zero-stress E 2 2 energy is determined to be 657.4\u00b10.2 cm\u2212 1. Fourier-transform infrared reflectance and absorption techniques allow us to measure the E 1 (TO) and A 1 (LO) phonon energies. The film \u2026",

On c-sapphire, monoclinic VO2 films were characterized to be epitaxial films with triple domain structure caused by \u03b2-angle mismatch. Monoclinic VO2 \u03b2 angle of 122.2\u00b0 and the two angles of V4+\u2013V4+ chain deviating from the am axis of 4.4\u00b0 and 4.3\u00b0 are determined. On r-sapphire, tetragonal VO2 was determined to be epitaxially deposited with VO2 (011)T perpendicular to the growth direction, while the structural phase transformation into lower symmetric monoclinic phase results in (2\u00af11) and (200) orientations forming a twinned structure.

The high degree of electrochemical activity without surface pretreatment, the enhanced S\/B ratios, and the excellent response stability demonstrate that diamond might be an attractive new electrode material for electroanalysis.

This blue shift is likewise attributed to strain and alloying. The GaAs-like second-order features are also seen to broaden slightly and diminish in intensity with increasing nitrogen concentration.

            "We report measurements of stress in GaN epitaxial layers grown on 6H\u2013SiC and \u03b1-Al2O3 substrates. Biaxial stresses span +1.0\u2009GPa (tensile) to \u22121.2\u2009GPa (compressive). Stress determined from curvature measurements, obtained using phase-shift interferometry (PSI) microscopy, compare well with measurements using accepted techniques of x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Correlation between XRD and Raman measurements of the E22 phonon gives a Raman-stress factor of \u22123.4\u00b10.3\u2009cm\u22121\/GPa. We apply PSI microscopy for temperature dependent stress measurements of the GaN films. Variations found in the stress\u2013temperature coefficient correlate well with threading dislocation densities. We develop a phenomenological model which describes the thermal stress of the epitaxial GaN as a superposition of that for ideal GaN and the free volume existing in the layers due to the threading \u2026",

Hole concentration of 4\u00d71017\u2009cm\u22123, with a mobility of 8 cm2\/Vs, is measured in Al0.4Ga0.6N\/GaN. We demonstrate effective n- and p-type doping of structures based on AlN\/AlGaInN.
