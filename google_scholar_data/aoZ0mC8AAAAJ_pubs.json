We demonstrate the possibility of filtering out the effects of unwanted (not necessarily known) system-environment interactions and show that the noise-suppression procedure can be combined with the capability of retaining control over the effective dynamical evolution of the open quantum system. Implications for quantum information processing are discussed.",

Decoherence introduced by the system\u2019s interaction with a quantum environment is shown to be washed out completely in the limit of continuous flipping and greatly suppressed provided the interval between the pulses is made comparable to the correlation time of the environment.

NMR spectroscopy is well known for its wealth of diverse coherent manipulations of spin dynamics. Ideas and instrumentation from liquid state NMR spectroscopy have been used to experiment with QIP. This approach has carried the field to a complexity of about 10 qubits, a small number for quantum computation but large enough for observing and better understanding the complexity of the quantum world. While liquid state NMR is the only present\u2010day technology about to reach this number of qubits, further increases in complexity will require new methods.

We propose a general constructive procedure for designing robust unitary gates on an open quantum system without encoding or measurement overhead. Our results allow for a low-level error correction strategy solely based on Hamiltonian engineering using realistic bounded-strength controls and may substantially reduce implementation requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.",

By exploiting a general algebraic approach, we show how appropriate encodings of quantum states result in obtaining universal control over dynamically generated noise-protected subsystems with limited control resources. In particular, we provide a constructive scheme based on two-body Hamiltonians for performing universal quantum computation over large noiseless spaces which can be engineered in the presence of arbitrary linear quantum noise.",
