We map out the potential signals and current constraints on such a framework in indirect searches, using a model-independent setup based on multi-step hierarchical cascade decays. While remaining agnostic to the details of the hidden sector model, our framework captures the generic broadening of the spectrum of secondary particles (photons, neutrinos,  and ) relative to the case of direct annihilation to Standard Model particles. We explore how indirect constraints on dark matter annihilation limit the parameter space for such cascade\/multi-particle decays. We investigate limits from the cosmic microwave background by Planck, the Fermi measurement of photons from the dwarf galaxies, and positron data from AMS-02.

Assuming that dark matter (DM) resides in the hidden sector and is charged under a stabilizing symmetry shared by both sectors, we determine all possible origins of weak-scale DM allowed within this broad framework. We show that DM can arise only through a handful of mechanisms, lending particular focus to Freeze-Out and Decay and Freeze-In, as well as their variations involving late time re-annihilations of DM and DM particle anti-particle asymmetries. Much like standard Freeze-Out, where the abundance of DM depends only on the annihilation cross-section of the DM particle, these mechanisms depend only on a very small subset of physical parameters, many of which may be measured directly at the LHC.

A general analysis implies that the QCD axino has a mass greater than or equal to that of the gravitino in the absence of unnatural fine-tuning or sequestering. As a consequence, bounds from thermal gravitino and QCD axino production are complementary in parameter space, and together provide a quite stringent limit on the reheating temperature after inflation given by T R< 10 3\u2212 10 6 GeV for an axion decay constant of f a= 10 9\u2212 10 12 GeV.

Contributions to the gravitino abundance from freeze-in can easily dominate over those from thermal scattering over a broad range of parameter space, eg, when the scalar superpartners are heavy. Because the relic abundance from freeze-in is independent of the reheating temperature after inflation, collider measurements may be used to unambiguously reconstruct the freeze-in origin of gravitinos. In particular, if gravitino freeze-in indeed accounts for the present day dark matter abundance, then the lifetime of the next-to-lightest superpartner is uniquely fixed by the superpartner spectrum.",

This setup is testable at hadron colliders and B factories. In the early universe, decays of a long lived particle produce B mesons and antimesons out of thermal equilibrium. These mesons\/antimesons then undergo C P violating oscillations before quickly decaying into visible and dark sector particles. Dark matter will be charged under the baryon number so that the visible sector baryon asymmetry is produced without violating the total baryon number of the Universe. The produced baryon asymmetry will be directly related to the leptonic charge asymmetry in neutral B decays: an experimental observable.

Portal interactions connecting visible and hidden sectors mediate the decay of the lightest observable superpartner (LOSP) into the LSP, allowing the LHC to function as a spectacular probe of the origin of hidden sector DM. As shown in a companion paper, this general two-sector framework allows only for a handful of DM production mechanisms, each of which maps to a distinctive window in lifetimes and cross-sections for the LOSP. In the present work we perform a systematic collider study of LOSP candidates and portal interactions, and for each case evaluate the prospects for successfully reconstructing the origin of DM at the LHC.
