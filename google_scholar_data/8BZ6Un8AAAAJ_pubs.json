            "Science and technologies based on terahertz frequency electromagnetic radiation (100 GHz\u201330 THz) have developed rapidly over the last 30 years. For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to'real world'applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the \u2026",

Protein structural dynamics are vital to biological function with protein flexibility affecting enzymatic reaction rates and sensory transduction cycling times. Conformational mode dynamics occur on the picosecond timescale and with the collective vibrational modes associated with these large scale structural motions in the 1\u2013100 cm\u2212 1 range. We have performed THz time domain spectroscopy (TTDS) of several biomolecular systems to explore the sensitivity of TTDS to distinguish different molecular species, different mutations within a single species and different conformations of a given biomolecule. We compare the measured absorbances to normal mode calculations and find that the TTDS absorbance reflects the density of normal modes determined by molecular \u2026",

The broad absorption shifts in frequency with decreasing temperature as expected with a strongly anharmonic potential and in agreement with neutron inelastic scattering results. Decreasing hydration shifts the absorption to higher frequencies, possibly resulting from decreased coupling mediated by the interior water molecules.

We specifically address the questions of the relative contributions of collective vibrational modes and relaxational contributions. When sample uniformity is controlled and multiple reflection effects included in the analysis, the overall dielectric response of large biomolecules in the THz range is broad and featureless. The response, however, is highly sensitive to hydration, temperature, binding, and conformational change. The origin of these effects is discussed with emphasis on the contribution of surface side chain relaxational loss and how this might be affected by environment, structure, and function.",

From cellular communication through membrane ion channels to oxygen uptake and delivery by haemoglobin, structural changes are critical. It has been suggested that vibrations that extend through the protein play a crucial role in controlling these structural changes. While nature may utilize such long-range vibrations for optimization of biological processes, bench-top characterization of these extended structural motions for engineered biochemistry has been elusive. Here we show the first optical observation of long-range protein vibrational modes. This is achieved by orientation-sensitive terahertz near-field microscopy measurements of chicken egg white lysozyme single crystals.

            "Dielectric response of hen egg white lysozyme is measured in the far infrared (5\u201365 cm\u22121, 0.15\u20131.95 THz, 0.6\u20138.1 meV) as a function of hydration. The frequency range is associated with collective vibrational modes of protein tertiary structure. The observed frequency dependence of the absorbance is broad and glass-like. For the entire frequency range, there is a slight increase in both the absorbance and index of refraction with increasing hydration for <0.27 h (mass of H2O per unit mass protein). At 0.27 h, the absorbance and index begin to increase more rapidly. This transition corresponds to the point where the first hydration shell is filled. The abrupt increase in dielectric response cannot be fully accounted for by the additional contribution to the dielectric response due to bulk water, suggesting that the protein has not yet achieved its fully hydrated state. The broad, glass-like response suggests that at low \u2026",
