            "We have created a long-lived (\u2248 40 s) persistent current in a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate held in an all-optical trap. A repulsive optical barrier across one side of the torus creates a tunable weak link in the condensate circuit, which can affect the current around the loop. Superflow stops abruptly at a barrier strength such that the local flow velocity at the barrier exceeds a critical velocity. The measured critical velocity is consistent with dissipation due to the creation of vortex-antivortex pairs. This system is the first realization of an elementary closed-loop atom circuit.",

We explore the characteristics of a singularity in a nondiffracting Bessel beam experimentally by use of a programmable spatial light modulator with 64-level phase holograms. The diffraction efficiency with 64-level phase holograms is greatly improved in comparison with that obtained with a binary grating. The experiments show that the size and deflection angle of the beam can be controlled in real time. The observations are in agreement with scalar diffraction theory.",

A high-repetition-rate, femtosecond, self-mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser is used to excite Cs produced in a well-collimated atomic beam. The time interval between the excitation pulse and the arrival of a fluorescence photon is measured repetitively until the desired statistics are obtained.

The method is useful for Doppler-free spectroscopy, for similification of molecular spectra, and for relaxation studies.

            "Using a thermal sample of laser-cooled rubidium atoms, we have constructed a neutral-atom circuit analogous to an electronic capacitor discharged through a resistor. The atoms are confined using what we call a free-space atom chip, an optical dipole trap created using a generalized phase-contrast imaging technique. We have also calculated theoretical values for the capacitance and resistance, which agree with our experiments, as well as theoretical value for an atomic analog of electrical inductance. We show that atomic capacitance is analogous to the quantum capacitance, the atomic resistance is analogous to the ballistic, or Sharvin resistance and the atomic inductance is analogous to kinetic inductance.",

            "Dissociative ionization of N 2 induced by intense picosecond radiation has been studied. A two-step multiphonon model, based on ionization of N 2 through vertical transitions and spontaneous dissociation of N 2 z+(Z\u2265 2) via Coulomb and non-Coulombic potentials curves, is presented to explain the origin of the kinetic energies of atomic ions observed. The model predicts that dissociation occurs near the internuclear separation of the neutral, charge-asymmetric dissociation channels are important, and dissociation via Coulomb curves will only be observed for pulses with extremely short rise times.",
