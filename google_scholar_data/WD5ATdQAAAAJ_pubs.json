            "Patient safety is a critical component to the quality of health care. As health care organizations endeavour to improve their quality of care, there is a growing recognition of the importance of establishing a culture of patient safety. In this research, the authors use the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) questionnaire to assess the culture of patient safety in Taiwan and attempt to provide an explanation for some of the phenomena that are unique in Taiwan. The authors used HSOPSC to measure the 12 dimensions of the patient safety culture from 42 hospitals in Taiwan. The survey received 788 respondents including physicians, nurses, and non-clinical staff. This study used SPSS 15.0 for Windows and Amos 7 software tools to perform the statistical analysis on the survey data, including descriptive statistics and confirmatory factor analysis of the structural equation model.

            "The health care industry in Taiwan has faced many challenges in recent years. To tackle those challenges, many hospitals in Taiwan began using management techniques used in other industries. As a result, quality management has become important within Taiwan's health care industry. This study provides a perspective on how this health care industry, by developing both quality control circle (QCC) practices and organizational learning techniques, responded to those challenges. In this study, the authors conducted a comprehensive review of studies published between 1995 and 2007 in Taiwan. The review focused on the quality management, QCC, organizational learning and health care organization aspects reported in previous studies.

The results also show that attitude could mediate perceived benefits\u2019 effects on respondents\u2019 behavioral intention. However, attitude could not mediate the impact of perceived barriers on behavioral intention. Therefore, policy makers should disseminate the microfinance benefits by engaging people who are important to the respondents, so that favourable attitude among the rural households can be increased.

As human activities have adverse impacts on the environment, developing pro-environmental behaviour in each individual is an essential aspect of protecting mother earth. The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate the influence of green work climate perceptions and harmonious environmental passion on pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). Additionally, the mediating effect of harmonious environmental passion between green work climate and PEB is determined. A total of 167 academics from a private university in Malaysia participated in this study. The results from Partial Least Square\u2013Structural Equation Modelling suggested that green work climate and harmonious environmental passion positively influence PEB. Apart from this, harmonious environmental passion partially mediates the relationship between green work climate and PEB. The results indicate that leaders should actively shape the perception of green work climate within their organisations through policies and procedures that support environmental sustainability efforts, as well as effectively communicate with their employees. Such efforts will lead to greater harmonious environmental passion, in turn, promoting pro-environmental behaviour among members.",
