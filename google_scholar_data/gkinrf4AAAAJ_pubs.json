            "In quasi two-dimensional electron and hole systems spin-orbit (SO) coupling strongly influences both the orbital and spin components of motion. In inversion asymmetric systems SO coupling causes a spin splitting even at magnetic field B= 0. Often this is analyzed by measuring the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at B> 0. However, SO coupling can give rise to anomalous SdH oscillations that are not simply related to the B= 0 spin splitting. Coupling the anisotropic orbital motion to the spin degree of freedom results in an anisotropic Zeeman splitting even for different crystallographic directions of an in-plane magnetic field.",

            "We report a manifestation of first-order magnetic transitions in two-dimensional electron systems. This phenomenon occurs in aluminum arsenide quantum wells with sufficiently low carrier densities and appears as a set of hysteretic spikes in the resistance of a sample placed in crossed parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields, each spike occurring at the transition between states with different partial magnetizations. Our experiments thus indicate that the presence of magnetic domains at the transition starkly increases dissipation, an effect also suspected in other ferromagnetic materials. Analysis of the positions of the transition spikes allows us to deduce the change in exchange-correlation energy across the magnetic transition, which in turn will help improve our understanding of metallic ferromagnetism.",
