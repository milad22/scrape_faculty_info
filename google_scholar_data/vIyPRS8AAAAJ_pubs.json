It is then shown that by simply replacing traces with supertraces the characters of certain representations for U(N\/M) and OSP(N\/2M) are obtained. Dimension formulas are derived by calculating the characters of a special diagonal supergroup element with (+1) and (\u22121) eigenvalues.

            "We present a canonical formulation of two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics in the axial or Coulomb gauge A 1 a= 0. For consistency with the Lagrange equations of motion, the Hamiltonian must include a nontrivial dynamical background electric field term. This breaks translation invariance in the gauge-noninvariant sector. We argue, however, that for the purpose of calculating gauge-invariant physical quantities one can consider the naive theory defined by the Feynman rules without the background electric field. We show that the naive theory has an anomalous Poincar\u00e9 algebra due to its non-Abelian character; the theory is Lorentz invariant only in the color-singlet sector. Because of this fact the quark propagator has a noncovariant pole, and the i \u03b5 prescription is different from the naive one. In the N\u2192\u221e limit (where N is the number of colors) we can set up a two-component Bethe-Salpeter equation in the \u2026",

The rules of supersymmetrization are characterized by extended Young supertableaux. This constructive approach leads to explicit transformation properties of higher representations as well as to closed explicit formulas for characters from which other invariants such as dimensions and eigenvalues of all Casimir operators can be calculated. We have applied this approach so far to the supergroups SU(N\/M), OSP(N\/2M), P(N), for which we have obtained all the representations constructible as direct products of the fundamental (defining) representations.

We demonstrate the equivalence of these modes to those proposed by Patrascioiu. The classical nonlinear field theory of the two-dimensional string is shown to be a completely integrable Hamiltonian system. The Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of normal-mode action variables alone; the mass-squared spectrum is linear in the Bohr-Sommerfeld approximation. The difficulties of canonical quantization are exposed using a particular timelike gauge which admits commuting center-of-mass coordinates.",

We present a conformal-invariant version of the standard model coupled to gravity, and show how Weyl symmetry may be used to obtain unprecedented analytic control over its cosmological solutions. Within this new framework, generic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies are geodesically complete through a series of big crunch\u2013big bang transitions.
