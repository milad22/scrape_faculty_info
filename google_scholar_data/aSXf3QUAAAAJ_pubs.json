Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors of morbidity and mortality.Results\u2002 Morbidity and mortality rates were 31% and 13.6%, respectively. Prompt diagnosis was the most powerful predictor of outcome of CP. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that morbidity and mortality were significantly related to a delay in diagnosis of more than 24\u2003h (P\u2003=\u20030.03 and P\u2003=\u20030.04).Conclusion\u2002 The results emphasize the importance of prompt assessment of a patient who develops symptoms after colonoscopy.",

            "Minimally invasive surgery has gained worldwide acceptance in the treatment of colonic cancer in the last decades, thanks to its well-known advantages in short-term outcomes. Nevertheless, the penetrance of minimally invasive colorectal surgery still remains low. Few studies and metanalysis, to date, have analyzed the results of robotic versus laparoscopic colorectal surgery, often with conflicting conclusions. The robotic platform, thanks to its technological features, may potentially overcome the limitation of standard laparoscopy, especially when performing a complete mesocolic excision resection and an intracorporeal anastomosis. Robotic surgery could also shorten the learning curve of young novice surgeons, provided that strict protocols of structured training are applied. This paper is an update on the current available outcomes of robotic vs laparoscopic surgery in right colectomy.",

Over the last decades extra-pulmonary locations of the disease have become more frequent due to the increased prevalence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the increase number of organ transplants. The urogenital localization represents about 27% of all extra-pulmonary localizations of TB and may be due either to a disseminated infection or to a primitive genitourinary localization. The majority of patients, has pyuria, sometimes with hematuria. The diagnosis of urinary tuberculosis is based on the finding of pyuria in the absence of infection by common bacteria. The initial medical treatment includes isoniazide, rifampicin, pyrazinami-de, ethambutol and streptomycin.

            "AIM: Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy (MM) is still the most common treatment for grades III and IV hemorrhoids despite prolonged post-operative anal pain and wound healing. This multicenter, double blind, randomized, controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and the efficacy of anal wound cleansing with Triclosan (Proctocid\u00ae) in the control of symptoms and healing time after MM. METHODS: A total of 113 patients with grades III and IV hemorrhoids, undergoing open hemorroidectomy by diathermy or Ligasure vessel sealing device, were randomly assigned to Triclosan or sodium hypochlorite solution. All patients received analgesics and a fiber-rich diet after hemorrhoidectomy. Postoperative anal pain, bleeding and\/or secretion and itch were assessed 7, 14 and 21 days after hemorrhoidectomy by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the day of complete re-epithelialization of anal wounds was recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were randomized for Triclosan treatment and 58 for the control drug. The two groups were comparable for demographics, severity of hemorrhoids and technique used for the hemorrhoidectomy. The comparison of days to get complete anal wound healing shows a trend of significance (P= 0.05) for the Triclosan group. Bleeding and\/or secretion, anal pain and itch were significantly better (P= 0.003; P< 0.0001 and P= 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Triclosan solution for the treatment of post-hemorrhoidectomy wounds is safe and improves the control of post-operative symptoms and wound healing time compared to sodium hypochlorite.",
