            "Application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to nanoscale samples has remained an elusive goal, achieved only with great experimental effort at subkelvin temperatures. We demonstrated detection of NMR signals from a (5-nanometer)3 voxel of various fluid and solid organic samples under ambient conditions. We used an atomic-size magnetic field sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy defect center, embedded ~7 nanometers under the surface of a bulk diamond to record NMR spectra of various samples placed on the diamond surface. Its detection volume consisted of only 104 nuclear spins with a net magnetization of only 102 statistically polarized spins.",

However, there are many circumstances in which it is impractical or undesirable to insert objects or subjects into the bore of a high-field magnet. Here we present a methodology based on an adaptation of nutation echoes that provides resolved spectra in the presence of matched inhomogeneous static and radiofrequency fields, thereby opening the way to high-resolution ex situ NMR. The observation of chemical shifts is regained through the use of multiple-pulse sequences of correlated, composite z-rotation pulses, producing resolved NMR spectra of liquid samples.",

As assembling identical spin clusters is difficult, new strategies are being developed to determine individual node structures with the highest precision. Here we use a pulse protocol to monitor the time evolution of the 13 C ensemble in the vicinity of a nitrogen-vacancy centre. We observe long-lived time correlations in the nuclear spin dynamics, limited by nitrogen-vacancy spin\u2013lattice relaxation. We use the host 14 N spin as a quantum register and demonstrate that hyperfine-shifted resonances can be separated upon proper nitrogen-vacancy initialization. Intriguingly, we find that the amplitude of the correlation signal exhibits a sharp dependence on the applied magnetic field. We discuss this observation in the \u2026",

The method relies on correlations in the chemical shifts between pairs of coupled spins.

These correlations can be exploited not only to provide resolution in two-dimensional spectra, but also to yield \u201cchains\u201d of correlated chemical shifts, constituting a valuable new source of structural information for disordered materials.

Comparison of optical spectra recorded at successive times reveals considerable spectral diffusion, possibly the result of slowly fluctuating, trapped-carrier-induced Stark shifts. Large spectral jumps\ue5f8reaching up to 100 nm\ue5f8followed by bleaching are observed in most cases upon prolonged exposure to blue light, an indication of one-directional photochemical changes possibly taking place on the flake surface.

Owing to the high-speed transmission and exceptional noise properties of photons, quantum photonic architectures are likely to play a central role. A long-standing hurdle, however, has been the realization of robust, device-compatible single-photon sources that can be activated and controlled on demand. Here we demonstrate large arrays of room-temperature quantum emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The large energy gap inherent to this van der Waals material stabilizes the emitters at room temperature within nanoscale regions defined by substrate-induced deformation of few-atomic-layer hBN.
