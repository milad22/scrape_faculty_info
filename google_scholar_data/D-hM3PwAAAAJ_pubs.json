            "In recent years, enhanced light\u2013matter interactions through a plethora of dipole-type polaritonic excitations have been observed in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. In graphene, electrically tunable and highly confined plasmon-polaritons were predicted and observed, opening up opportunities for optoelectronics, bio-sensing and other mid-infrared applications. In hexagonal boron nitride, low-loss infrared-active phonon-polaritons exhibit hyperbolic behaviour for some frequencies, allowing for ray-like propagation exhibiting high quality factors and hyperlensing effects. In transition metal dichalcogenides, reduced screening in the 2D limit leads to optically prominent excitons with large binding energy, with these polaritonic modes having been recently observed with scanning near-field optical microscopy. Here, we review recent progress in state-of-the-art experiments, and survey the vast library of polaritonic \u2026",

Such materials exhibit unique nanophotonic properties enabled by the highly directional propagation of slow-light modes localized at deeply sub-diffractional length scales. While artificial hyperbolic metamaterials have been demonstrated, they suffer from high plasmonic losses and require complex nanofabrication, which in turn induces size-dependent limitations on optical confinement. The low-loss, mid-infrared, natural hyperbolic material hexagonal boron nitride is an attractive alternative. Here we report on three-dimensionally confined \u2018hyperbolic polaritons\u2019 in boron nitride nanocones that support four series (up to the seventh order) modes in two spectral bands. The resonant modes obey the predicted aspect ratio dependence and exhibit high-quality factors (Q up to 283) in the strong \u2026",

The emphasis of this work is on providing an understanding of the general      phenomenon, including the origin of the Reststrahlen band, the role that optical      phonons in polar dielectric lattices play in supporting sub-diffraction-limited      modes and how the relatively long optical phonon lifetimes can lead to the low      optical losses observed within these materials. Based on this overview, the      achievements attained to date and the potential technological advantages of      these materials are discussed for localized modes in nanostructures, propagating      modes on surfaces and in waveguides and novel metamaterial designs, with the      goal of realizing low-loss nanophotonics and metamaterials in the mid-infrared      to terahertz spectral ranges.",

Among these materials, layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with its wide bandgap energy (\u223c 5.0\u20136.0 eV), has clearly established that 2D nitrides are key to advancing 2D devices 1. A gap, however, remains between the theoretical prediction of 2D nitrides \u2018beyond hBN\u20192, 3 and experimental realization of such structures. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of 2D gallium nitride (GaN) via a migration-enhanced encapsulated growth (MEEG) technique utilizing epitaxial graphene. We theoretically predict and experimentally validate that the atomic structure of 2D GaN grown via MEEG is notably different from reported theory 2, 3, 4. Moreover, we establish that graphene plays a critical role in stabilizing the direct-bandgap (nearly 5.0 eV), 2D buckled \u2026",

Both the enlarged imaging and the super-resolution focusing are explained based on the volume-confined, wavelength dependent propagation angle of hyperbolic phonon polaritons. With advanced infrared nanoimaging techniques and state-of-art mid-infrared laser sources, we have succeeded in demonstrating and visualizing these unexpected phenomena in both Type I and Type II hyperbolic conditions, with both occurring naturally within hexagonal boron nitride.

We demonstrate the dry transfer of epitaxial graphene (EG) from the C-face of 4H-SiC onto SiO2, GaN and Al2O3 substrates using a thermal release tape. Subsequent Hall effect measurements illustrated that minimal degradation in the carrier mobility was induced following the transfer process in lithographically patterned devices. Correspondingly, a large drop in the carrier concentration was observed following the transfer process, supporting the notion that a gradient in the carrier density is present in C-face EG, with lower values being observed in layers further removed from the SiC interface. X-ray photoemission spectra collected from EG films attached to the transfer tape revealed the presence of atomic Si within the EG layers, which may indicate the identity of the unknown \u2026",
