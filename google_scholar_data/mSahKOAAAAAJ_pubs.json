            "It is proposed that potential drug cues are evaluated preattentively, are prioritized, and subsequently trigger somatovisceral, behavioral, and cognitive responses. Throughout, this information processing is subjected to automatized attentional and interpretative biases. These processes can enhance subjective awareness of physiological arousal, action tendencies, and cognitions but can also be inhibitory. Accordingly, different components of cue reactivity do not gain equal access to the limited processing resources necessary to generate experience of craving.",

Their performance was compared to controls (n=33) who were staff recruited from specialist substance misuse clinics based on the presumption of familiarity with the alcohol and addiction related terms of the Stroop task. The card-format Stroop test contained words such as \u201calcohol\u201d and \u201crelapse\u201d and neutral, semantically homogenous words such as \u201ctable\u201d and \u201cchair.\u201d Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant main effects for word type with both the clinic attendees and controls taking longer to colour-name alcohol-related words. Predicted interactions between word type and subject status were not observed. These findings suggest that both problem drinkers and clinic staff did not differ significantly in the degree of Stroop interference displayed, although a trend \u2026",

            "Cognitive neuroscience characterizes addiction as a disorder of appetite resulting in the development of compulsive patterns of drug acquisition and consumption. The cognitive processes that govern the resulting sensitivity to incentive-related cues are relatively automatized. The outcomes of this processing are thus unavailable to introspection and resistive to modification. Further, because repeated drug intoxication is associated with deficits in executive control of cognitive functions such as attentional switching, the capacity of addicted individuals to overcome habitual responding is compromised. Evidence-based therapeutic interventions, including cognitivebehaviour therapy (CBT), must accommodate findings revealed in this monograph in order to maintain empirical status and the potential to deliver enhanced outcomes. There are three broad implications for therapeutic practice. First, CBT needs to acknowledge fully the autonomy of addiction in the face of efforts to change. This sets the context for a more resilient therapeutic alliance in the face of inevitable setbacks. Secondly, the primary therapeutic focus needs to be on efforts to enhance impulse control in advance of, or at least parallel with, attempts to improve affect regulation or interpersonal functioning. Thirdly, therapy should aim to modulate the impact of cognitive biases either directly through re-training or rehearsal, or more generally through mindfulness or other meta-cognitive approaches. Conversely, changes in implicit cognitive processes such as selective attention should,",

            "Reward prediction and valuation are central to decision making (Schultz et al., 1997; O\u2019Doherty, 2004), and thus motivate and guide human action. Faulty reward processing can be pragmatically viewed as compromised decision-making, reflected in making suboptimal choices. A primary aim of this Research Topic is to provide a dimensional approach for reward processing. In accordance with the Research Domain Criteria, a newly proposed research classification of mental health disorders based on behavioral dimensions and neurobiological findings (Insel et al., 2010), reward processing deficits can be of transdiagnostic importance. This prominence has been largely influenced by the evolution of novel neuroimaging techniques, experimental cognitive psychology findings, and the application of computational modeling in simulating human behavior. This body of work has increased knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying aberrant reward processing. We maintain that construing patterns or expressions of reward processing as potential biomarkers, or indices of psychological vulnerability, can facilitate early detection and intervention in the clinical arena. Additionally, therapeutic approaches originating in the psychology laboratory aimed at modifying or reversing cognitive biases or behavioral approach biases linked to aberrant reward processes are showing promise in preventing relapse in the context of addiction (see Gladwin et al., 2016). It is this twin promise of enhanced prediction of vulnerability or risk and ultimately improved clinical outcomes, combined with a deeper understanding of brain functions, that motivated us to \u2026",
