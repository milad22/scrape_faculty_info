We observe spectral diffusion in individual quantum dot luminescence lines. The phenomenon increases in magnitude with optical power density, but is not visible at low powers. We believe the spectral diffusion to be caused by long time-scale trapping and untrapping of charges created by photoionization or thermal ionization in the immediate vicinity of the quantum dots.",

This was accomplished by using nanosphere lithography to deposit silver nanoparticles on the ISAM film, tuning the geometry of the particles to make their plasmonic resonances overlap the frequency of optical excitation. An enhancement in the efficiency of second harmonic generation (SHG) by as much as 1600 times was observed.

In a quantum repeater, information is stored in the quantum state of a semiconductor electron spin, while complementary entangled information is transmitted as a photon down the optical fiber.

In this paper, we present a variation of this technique, where the drying meniscus is restricted by a straight-edge located approximately 100 \u03bcm above the substrate adjacent to the drying zone. Surprisingly, we find this technique to yield films at roughly twice the growth rate compared to the standard technique. We attribute this to differing rates of diffusion of vapor from the drying crystal in the two cases. We also investigate the crystal growth rate dependence on ambient relative humidity and find, contrary to some previous reports, that the growth rate depends strongly on the humidity. We introduce a model which indicates that while the length of the drying zone may increase with humidity, this alone cannot \u2026",
