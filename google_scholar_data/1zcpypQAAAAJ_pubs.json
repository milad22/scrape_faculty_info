The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the scheduling literature on models with setup times (costs) from then to date covering more than 300 papers.

            "Supply chain management (SCM) has been considered as the most popular operations strategy for improving organizational competitiveness in the twenty-first century. In the early 1990s, agile manufacturing (AM) gained momentum and received due attention from both researchers and practitioners. In the mid-1990s, SCM began to attract interest. Both AM and SCM appear to differ in philosophical emphasis, but each complements the other in objectives for improving organizational competitiveness. For example, AM relies more on strategic alliances\/partnerships (virtual enterprise environment) to achieve speed and flexibility. But the issues of cost and the integration of suppliers and customers have not been given due consideration in AM. By contrast, cost is given a great deal of attention in SCM, which focuses on the integration of suppliers and customers to achieve an integrated value chain with the help of \u2026",

We designed a questionnaire and used it to survey a randomly selected sample of customers of IB from the Yellow Pages, and obtained 203 usable responses. We analyzed the data using Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) to evaluate the strength of the hypothesized relationships, if any, among the constructs, which include Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Web Security as independent variables, Perceived Usefulness and Attitude as intervening variables, and Intention to Use as the dependent variable.

For a decentralized supply chain comprising a manufacturer and a retailer, we derive the members\u2019 optimal inventory policies under different information sharing scenarios. We show that increasing information sharing among the members in a decentralized supply chain will lead to Pareto improvement in the performance of the entire chain.
