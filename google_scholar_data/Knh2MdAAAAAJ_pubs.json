            "The use of avidin-biotin interaction in immunoenzymatic techniques provides a simple and sensitive method to localize antigens in formalin-fixed tissues. Among the several staining procedures available, the ABC method, which involves an application of biotin-labeled secondary antibody followed by the addition of avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex, gives a superior result when compared to the unlabeled antibody method. The availability of biotin-binding sites in the complex is created by the incubation of a relative excess of avidin with biotin-labeled peroxidase. During formation of the complex, avidin acts as a bridge between biotin-labeled peroxidase molecules; and biotin-labeled peroxidase molecules, which contains several biotin moieties, serve as a link between the avidin molecules. Consequently, a \"lattice\" complex containing several peroxidase molecules is likely formed. Binding of this complex to the \u2026",

            "A highly sensitive immunoenzymatic technic is presented. The method involves three sequential steps: (1) primary antibody, (2) biotin-labeled secondary antibody, and (3) avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Avidin, an egg white protein, has four binding sites for the low-molecular weight vitamin biotin. Many moieties of biotin can be coupled to the peroxidase molecule. Thus, since a relatively large amount of avidin is incubated with biotin-labeled peroxidase, avidin serves as a link between biotin-peroxidase molecules; in turn, biotin-peroxidase serves as a link between avidin molecules. Consequently, this large lattice-like complex with biotin-binding capability can be attracted to the sites of biotin-labeled antibody, producing a superior staining sensitivity.

Covalently coupling biotin or avidin to peroxidase molecules does not interfere with their normal biochemical functions. The avidin or biotin molecules, either peroxidase conjugated or unconjugated, can be brought to the antigen sites by means of an antiavidin antibody. Several immunohistochemical staining technics based on this principal have been described. The method utilizing an avidin-biotinperoxidase complex was found to be more sensitive than the unlabeled antibody (PAP) method. This method involved four sequential staining procedures: (1) primary antibody (goat antihuman antigen); (2) secondary antibody (rabbit antigoat IgG) added in relative excess; (3) goat antiavidin antibody; (4) avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex.

In general, the ABC method produced the most intense staining and the least background staining of any method tested.

            "Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders of uncertain cause1. Two pathologic types, hyaline vascular and plasma-cell disease, have been recognized. The plasma-cell variant of Castleman's disease may be localized or multicentric. Multicentric disease is a systemic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypergammaglobulinemia are also common. Interleukin-6, a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on the immune system, hematopoiesis, and acute-phase reactions, is a putative growth factor in multiple myeloma and may also be central to the pathophysiology of Castleman's disease2\u20137.
