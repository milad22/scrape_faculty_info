            "Recent progress in understanding the topological properties of condensed matter has led to the discovery of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators. A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals\u2014superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties\u2014provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results \u2026",

In bilayer graphene, we find that the quantized anomalous Hall conductivity is twice that of the single-layer case when the gate voltage U is smaller than the exchange field M, and zero otherwise. Although the Chern number vanishes when U> M, the system still exhibits a quantized valley Hall effect, with the edge states in opposite valleys propagating in opposite directions.

This effect is not captured by the random-phase approximation (RPA), commonly used to describe electron fluids, and is due to coupling between the center-of-mass motion and the pseudospin degree of freedom of the graphene\u2019s massless Dirac fermions. By making use of diagrammatic perturbation theory to first order in the electron-electron interaction, we show that this coupling enhances both the plasmon frequency and the Drude weight relative to the RPA value. We also show that interactions are responsible for a significant enhancement of the optical conductivity at frequencies just above the absorption threshold.
