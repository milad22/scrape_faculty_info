            "We derive the structure of the density matrix for two Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field to all orders of perturbation theory, in spacetimes admitting a well-defined Wightman function. Calculating all of its leading terms enables us to fully characterize observable correlations, entanglement, and quantum discord. We apply these results to study detector responses in two locally flat topologically nontrivial spacetimes constructed from identifications of Minkowski space. We demonstrate how local statistics and detector-detector correlations depend on the global spacetime structure. In particular, we show that if the spacetime has a preferred direction, this direction may be inferred from the dependence of correlations between the two detectors on their orientation. While using such measurements to distinguish spacetimes with identical local geometry is apparently impractical, this effect points to \u2026",

Our study, focusing on the BTZ black hole, reveals that black holes inhibit entanglement harvesting. For two detectors with fixed proper separation along the radial direction, we demonstrate that the entanglement harvested rapidly falls to zero as the detectors move closer to the horizon. This effect is a combination of black hole radiation and gravitational redshift, both generic properties of horizons, suggesting it is a general result for black holes.",

This formalism is based upon conditioning a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation on a subsystem of the Universe, serving as a clock, being in a state corresponding to a time . Doing so assigns a conditional state to the rest of the Universe , referred to as the system. We demonstrate that when the total Hamiltonian appearing in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation contains an interaction term coupling the clock and system, the conditional state  satisfies a time-nonlocal Schr\u00f6dinger equation in which the system Hamiltonian is replaced with a self-adjoint integral operator. This time-nonlocal Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved perturbatively and three examples of clock-system interactions are examined. One example considered supposes that the clock and system interact via Newtonian gravity, which leads to the system's Hamiltonian developing corrections on the order of  and inversely proportional to the distance between the clock and system.",

We begin by reviewing the Unruh-DeWitt detector and its interaction with a real scalar field in the vacuum state, as well as the entanglement harvesting protocol in general. We then examine how the entanglement harvested by a pair of such detectors depends on their spacetime trajectory, separation, spacetime curvature, and boundary conditions satisfied by the field. The harvested entanglement is interpreted as an indicator of field entanglement between the localized regions where the detectors interact with the field, and thus this investigation allows us to probe indirectly the entanglement structure of the AdS vacuum.

We explicitly compute the resulting state for arbitrarily chosen proper accelerations of the observers and independently tuned distance between them. To do so, we introduce a generalized Rindler frame of reference and analytically derive the corresponding state transformation as a Gaussian channel. Our approach provides several new insights into the phenomenon of vacuum entanglement such as the highly nontrivial effect of spatial separation between the observers including sudden death of entanglement. We also calculate the fidelity of the two-mode channel for nonvacuum Gaussian states and obtain bounds on classical and quantum capacities of a single-mode channel.

Using quantum reduction maps, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between three approaches to relational quantum dynamics: 1) relational observables in the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantization, 2) Page and Wootters'(PW) Schr\u00f6dinger picture formalism, and 3) the relational Heisenberg picture obtained via symmetry reduction. Constituting three faces of the same dynamics, we call this equivalence the trinity. We develop a quantization procedure for relational Dirac observables using covariant POVMs which encompass non-ideal clocks. The quantum reduction maps reveal this procedure as the quantum analog of gauge-invariantly extending gauge-fixed quantities. We establish algebraic properties of these relational observables. We extend a recentclock-neutral'approach to changing temporal reference frames, transforming relational observables and states, and demonstrate a clock dependent temporal nonlocality effect. We show that Kucha\u0159's criticism, alleging that the conditional probabilities of the PW formalism violate the constraint, is incorrect. They are a quantum analog of a gauge-fixed description of a gauge-invariant quantity and equivalent to the manifestly gauge-invariant evaluation of relational observables in the physical inner product. The trinity furthermore resolves a previously reported normalization ambiguity and clarifies the role of entanglement in the PW formalism. The trinity finally permits us to resolve Kucha\u0159's criticism that the PW formalism yields wrong propagators by showing how conditional probabilities of relational observables \u2026",

Since every Lorentz transformation can be decomposed into a pure boost followed by a rotation, we begin by analyzing the effects on communication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation relating their frames, when the transformation is either a rotation or a pure boost. This then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication is affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an arbitrary Lorentz transformation.
