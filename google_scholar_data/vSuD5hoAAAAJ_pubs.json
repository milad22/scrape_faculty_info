This work evaluates the performance of several statistical and machine learning imputation methods that were used to predict recurrence in patients in an extensive real breast cancer data set.

One of the most popular solutions is missing data imputation by the K nearest neighbours (K NN) algorithm.

This method provides a missing data estimation aimed at solving the classification task, ie, it provides an imputed dataset which is directed toward improving the classification performance. The MI-based distance metric is also used to implement an effective K NN classifier.

Using historical patient information stored in clinical datasets, data mining and machine learning approaches can be applied to predict the survival of breast cancer patients. A common drawback is the absence of information, i.e., missing data, in certain clinical trials. However, most standard prediction methods are not able to handle incomplete samples and, then, missing data imputation is a widely applied approach for solving this inconvenience. Therefore, and taking into account the characteristics of each breast cancer dataset, it is required to perform a detailed analysis to determine the most appropriate imputation and prediction methods in each clinical environment.
