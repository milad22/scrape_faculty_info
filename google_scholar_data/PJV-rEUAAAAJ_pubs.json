GaSb is a direct gap semiconductor (0.72 eV) capable of being doped either p or n type with good mobilities and it has significant electro-optical potential in the near IR range. As a substrate, or active layer, GaSb can be employed in conjunction with many semiconductors such as (AlGa)Sb or In(AsSb) and has interesting heterojunction potential for detectors and lasers and quantum well structures.",

Neutron irradiation tends to create disordered regions in the GaN, while the damage from the other forms of radiation is more typically point defects. In all cases, the damaged region contains carrier traps that reduce the mobility and conductivity of the GaN and at high enough doses, a significant degradation of device performance. GaN is several orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage than GaAs of similar doping concentrations. In terms of heterostructures, preliminary data suggests that the radiation hardness decreases in the order AlN\/GaN\u2009>\u2009AlGaN\/GaN\u2009>\u2009InAlN\/GaN, consistent with the average bond strengths in the Al-based materials.",

Protons, electrons and gamma rays typically produce point defects in GaN, in contrast to neutron damage which is dominated by more extended disordered regions. Regardless of the type of radiation, the electrical conductivity of the GaN is reduced through the introduction of trap states with thermal ionization energies deep in the forbidden bandgap. An important practical parameter is the carrier removal rate for each type of radiation since this determines the dose at which device degradation will occur. Many studies have shown that GaN is several orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage than GaAs, i.e. it can withstand radiation doses of at least two orders of magnitude higher than those degrading GaAs with a similar doping level.

It is shown that the Si donors ionization energy increases from 18 meV for 0<x<0.1 to about 50 meV for x=0.4 and does not exceed 90 meV for x=0.6. Increase in Al composition is also accompanied by the growth of the density of defects with energy levels deeper than Si. Combined action of the two above effects leads to increased difficulty in n-type doping of AlGaN films with higher Al mole fractions. Persistent photoconductivity (PPC) is shown to be a characteristic feature of AlGaN samples of all compositions. It is shown that PPC in AlGaN is related to the presence of centers with a relatively high (0.1\u20130.2 eV) barrier for capture of electrons.

            "It is shown that in n-GaN samples with a strong yellow luminescence band the deep levels spectra measured by optical transient current spectroscopy (OTCS) is always dominated by a hole trap at Ev+0.85 eV which is absent in the spectra of the samples with weak yellow luminescence. Based on the results of recent theoretical calculations it is suggested that these traps could be gallium vacancies VGa and that the centers responsible for yellow luminescence are formed by pairing such vacancies with shallow donors. The results indicate that the yellow luminescence band could be the dominant recombination channel in the samples with strong yellow luminescence band whereas in the samples with weak yellow luminescence recombination this role is taken over by nonradiative recombination centers. Deep levels transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements revealed the existence of a barrier for capture of \u2026",
