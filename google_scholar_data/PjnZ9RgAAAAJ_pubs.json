A comparison with the result of the previous measurement performed in 1999 sets a limit of (\u2212 29\u00b157) Hz for the drift of \u03bd H with respect to the ground state hyperfine splitting \u03bd Cs in Cs 133. Combining this result with the recently published optical transition frequency in Hg+ 199 against \u03bd Cs and a microwave Rb 87 and Cs 133 clock comparison, we deduce separate limits on \u03b1\/\u03b1=(\u2212 0.9\u00b12.9)\u00d7 10\u2212 15 yr\u2212 1 and the fractional time variation of the ratio of Rb and Cs nuclear magnetic moments \u03bc Rb\/\u03bc Cs equal to (\u2212 0.5\u00b11.7)\u00d7 10\u2212 15 yr\u2212 1.

The QCD corrections at NLO are contained in the factor denoted by \u03b7 2 which modifies the result obtained at the lowest order of perturbation theory. In the Standard Model case, we confirm the results for \u03b7 2 obtained by Buras, Jamin and Weisz [Nucl. Phys. B 347 (] 990) 49] 1. The factor \u03b7 2 is gauge and renormalization prescription invariant and it does not depend on the infrared behaviour of the theory, which constitutes an important test of the calculations. The NLO calculations within the 2HDM enhance the LO result up to 18%, which affects the correlation between M y and V td.",

The method is based on a division of the integration with respect to the photon energy into a high-and a low-energy part. The high-energy part is calculated by an expansion of the electron propagator in powers of the Coulomb field. The low-energy part is simplified by the application of a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This transformation leads to a clear separation of the leading contribution from the relativistic corrections and removes higher-order terms. The method is applied to the 2 P 1\/2 and 2 P 3\/2 states in atomic hydrogen. The results lead to theoretical values for the Lamb shifts and the fine-structure splitting.\u00a9 1996 The American Physical Society.",
