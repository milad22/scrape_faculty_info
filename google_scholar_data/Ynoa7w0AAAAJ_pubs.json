            "The D\u00d8 detector is a large general purpose detector for the study of short-distance phenomena in high energy antiproton-proton collisions, now in operation at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The detector focusses upon the detection of electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse momentum. We describe the design and performance of the major elements of the detector, including the tracking chambers, transition radiation detector, liquid argon calorimetry and muon detection. The associated electronics, triggering systems and data acquisition systems are presented. The global mechanical, high voltage, and experiment monitoring and control systems which support the detector are described. We also discuss the design and implementation of software and software support systems that are specific to D\u00d8.",

We study these effects in dilepton and diphoton production at hadron colliders. Specifically, we examine the double differential cross section in the invariant mass and scattering angle, which is found to be useful in separating the gravity effects from the standard model. In this work, sensitivity obtained using the double differential cross section is higher than that in previous studies based on single differential distributions. Assuming no excess of events over the standard model predictions, we obtain the following 95% confidence level lower limits on the effective Planck scale: 0.9\u20131.5 TeV in the Fermilab Tevatron run I, 1.3\u20132.5 TeV in run IIa, 1.7\u20133.5 \u2026",

We look for possible signals for this interaction in the present high-energy collider data, and estimate the sensitivity offered by the next generation of collider experiments. Based on the present data from the CERN LEP 2, Fermilab Tevatron, and DESY HERA experiments, we set a lower limit on the extra dimension compactification scale M C> 6.8 TeV at the 9 5% confidence level (dominated by the LEP 2 results) and quote expected sensitivities in the Tevatron Run 2 and at the CERN LHC.",

If so, the LHC would produce dark matter through these mediators, leading to the familiar\" mono-X\" search signatures, but the mediators would also produce signals without missing momentum via the same vertices involved in their production. This document from the LHC Dark Matter Working Group suggests how to compare searches for these two types of signals in case of vector and axial-vector mediators, based on a workshop that took place on September 19\/20, 2016 and subsequent discussions. These suggestions include how to extend the spin-1 mediated simplified models already in widespread use to include lepton couplings. This document also provides analytic calculations of the relic density in the simplified models and reports an issue that arose when ATLAS and CMS first began to use preliminary numerical calculations of the dark matter relic density in these models.",

Hawking radiation of these black holes is expected to be constrained mainly to our three-dimensional world and results in rich phenomenology. In this topical review we discuss the current status of astrophysical observations of black holes and selected aspects of mini-black-hole phenomenology, such as production at colliders and in cosmic rays, and black-hole decay properties, Hawking radiation as a sensitive probe of the dimensionality of extra space, as well as an exciting possibility of finding new physics in the decays of black holes.",
