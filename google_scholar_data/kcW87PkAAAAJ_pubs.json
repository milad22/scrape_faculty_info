Two of the four were previously identified as stratospheric CR air showers during the ANITA-I flight. A third stratospheric CR was detected during the ANITA-II flight. Here, we report on characteristics of these three unusual CR events, which develop nearly horizontally, 20\u201330 km above the surface of Earth. In addition, we report on a fourth steeply upward-pointing ANITA-I CR-like radio event which has characteristics consistent with a primary that emerged from the surface of the ice. This suggests a possible \u03c4-lepton decay as the origin of this event, but such an interpretation would require significant suppression of the standard model \u03c4-neutrino cross section.",

This event, observed in the third flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), a NASA-sponsored long-duration balloon payload, is consistent with a similar event reported in a previous flight. These events could be produced by the atmospheric decay of an upward-propagating \u03c4 lepton produced by a \u03bd \u03c4 interaction, although their relatively steep arrival angles create tension with the standard model neutrino cross section. Each of the two events have a posteriori background estimates of\u2272 10\u2212 2 events. If these are generated by \u03c4-lepton decay, then either the charged-current \u03bd \u03c4 cross section is suppressed at EeV energies, or the events arise at moments when the peak flux of a transient neutrino source was much larger than the typical expected cosmogenic \u2026",

These events may be of \u03bd \u03c4 origin, in which the neutrino interacts within the Earth to produce a \u03c4 lepton that emerges from the Earth, decays in the atmosphere, and initiates an extensive air shower. In this paper we estimate an upper bound on the ANITA acceptance to a diffuse \u03bd \u03c4 flux detected via \u03c4-lepton-induced air showers within the bounds of standard model uncertainties. By comparing this estimate with the acceptance of Pierre Auger Observatory and IceCube and assuming standard model interactions, we conclude that a \u03bd \u03c4 origin of these events would imply a neutrino flux at least two orders of magnitude above current bounds.",
