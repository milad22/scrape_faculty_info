            "A new theory is presented for calculating the structure of finite nuclei from the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The essential features of the reaction matrix in finite nuclei are obtained from nuclear-matter theory through the local-density approximation. The resulting density-and energy-dependent effective interaction is justified in detail, and it is shown that the tensor force plays an important role in saturation. The effective interaction is cast into two different forms, one convenient for use in calculating matrix elements and the other specialized for a Hartree-Fock calculation in position space. The density-dependent Hartree-Fock equations are derived by variation of the ground-state expectation value of the energy, and in addition to the usual Hartree-Fock terms, one obtains rearrangement terms arising from the variation of the density appearing in the density-dependent interaction. The appropriate angular-momentum \u2026",

Our investigation includes helicity dependent and independent generalized parton distributions for pion masses as low as 350 MeV and volumes as large as (3.5 fm) 3, for a lattice spacing of 0.124 fm. We use perturbative renormalization at one-loop level with an improvement based on the nonperturbative renormalization factor for the axial vector current, and only connected diagrams are included in the isosinglet channel.",
