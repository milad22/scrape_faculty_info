The measurements are carried out by the STAR experiment at midrapidity (| y|< 0.5) and within the transverse momentum range 0.4< p T< 0.8 GeV\/c in the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These measurements are important for understanding the quantum chromodynamic phase diagram. The products of the moments, S \u03c3 and \u03ba \u03c3 2, are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and dense medium created in the collisions and are related to the ratios of baryon number susceptibilities of corresponding orders. The products of moments are found to have values significantly below the Skellam expectation and close to expectations based on \u2026",

The charm production cross section per nucleon-nucleon collision at midrapidity scales with the number of binary collisions, N bin, from p+ p to central Au+ Au collisions. The D 0 meson yields in central Au+ Au collisions are strongly suppressed compared to those in p+ p scaled by N bin, for transverse momenta p T> 3 GeV\/c, demonstrating significant energy loss of charm quarks in the hot and dense medium. An enhancement at intermediate p T is also observed. Model calculations including strong charm-medium interactions and coalescence hadronization describe our measurements.",

However, the relatively short-lived expansion in nuclear collisions allows antimatter to decouple quickly from matter, and avoid annihilation. Thus, a high-energy accelerator of heavy nuclei provides an efficient means of producing and studying antimatter.

            "Local parity-odd domains are theorized to form inside a quark-gluon plasma which has been produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The local parity-odd domains manifest themselves as charge separation along the magnetic field axis via the chiral magnetic effect. The experimental observation of charge separation has previously been reported for heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. In this Letter, we present the results of the beam-energy dependence of the charge correlations in Au+ Au collisions at midrapidity for center-of-mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV from the STAR experiment. After background subtraction, the signal gradually reduces with decreased beam energy and tends to vanish by 7.7 GeV. This implies the dominance of hadronic interactions over partonic ones at lower collision energies.",

A significant difference in the v 2 values for particles and the corresponding antiparticles was observed at all transverse momenta for the first time. The difference increases with decreasing center-of-mass energy, s NN (or increasing baryon chemical potential, \u03bc B), and is larger for the baryons as compared to the mesons. This implies that particles and antiparticles are no longer consistent with the universal number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of v 2 that was observed at s NN= 200 GeV. However, for \u2026",
