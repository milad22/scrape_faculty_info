            "Thermal-bias-induced spin angular momentum transfer between a paramagnetic metal and ferromagnetic insulator is studied theoretically based on the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) phenomenology. Magnons in the ferromagnet establish a nonequilibrium steady state by equilibrating with phonons via bulk Gilbert damping and electrons in the paramagnet via spin pumping, according to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Subthermal magnons and the associated spin currents are treated classically, while the appropriate quantum crossover is imposed on high-frequency magnetic fluctuations. We identify several length scales in the ferromagnet, which govern qualitative changes in the dependence of the thermally induced spin current on the magnetic film thickness.",

First, we consider a quantum dot that is tunnel coupled to two topological superconductors. The effective spin-Majorana exchange facilitates a hybrid cnot gate for which either qubit can be the control or target. The second setup is a modular scalable network of topological superconductors and quantum dots. As a result of the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits, a cnot gate is implemented that acts on neighboring Majorana qubits and eliminates the necessity of interqubit braiding. In both setups, the spin-Majorana exchange interaction allows for a phase gate, acting on either the spin or the Majorana qubit, and for a swap or hybrid swap gate which is sufficient for universal quantum computation without projective measurements.",

Promoting the center of the Skyrmion to a dynamic quantity, the fluctuations around the Skyrmionic configuration give rise to a time-dependent damping of the Skyrmion motion. From the frequency dependence of the damping kernel, we are able to identify the Skyrmion mass, thus providing a microscopic description of the kinematic properties of Skyrmions. When defects are present or a magnetic trap is applied, the Skyrmion mass acquires a finite value proportional to the effective spin, even at vanishingly small temperature. We demonstrate that a Skyrmion in a confined geometry provided by a magnetic trap behaves as a massive particle owing to its quasi-one-dimensional confinement. An additional quantum \u2026",

The bulk states lowest in energy of such a nanowire have a spin polarization parallel or antiparallel to the applied magnetic field in the topological or trivial phase, respectively. We show that this property can be probed by the quantum dot created at the end of the nanowire by external gates. By tuning one of the two spin-split levels of the quantum dot to be in resonance with nanowire bulk states, one can detect the spin polarization of the lowest band via transport measurement. This allows one to determine the topological phase of the Rashba nanowire independently of the presence of Majorana bound states.",

Upon directly applying this to the tunneling model Hamiltonian, we calculate the effective magnetic field on the quantum dot flanked by two Majorana bound states.

Using materials and techniques that are already experimentally available, our proposed set-up is sensitive enough to detect a single nuclear spin within ten milliseconds of data acquisition at room temperature.
