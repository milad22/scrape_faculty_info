            "In the interim between the conception of this issue of MRS Bulletin on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) and its publication, the remarkable applications dependent on these materials have continued to make sweeping strides. These include the advent of larger flat-screen high-definition televisions (HDTVs), larger and higher-resolution screens on portable computers, the increasing importance of low emissivity (\u201clow-e\u201d) and electrochromic windows, a significant increase in the manufacturing of thin-film photovoltaics (PV), and a plethora of new hand-held and smart devices, all with smart displays.1-7 Coupled with the increased importance of TCO materials to these application technologies has been a renaissance over the last two years in the science of these materials.

            "The electron affinities of several metal oxide semiconductors that have been used as anodes in photoelectrochemical cells are calculated using the atomic electronegativities of the constituent atoms. These electron affinities are quantitatively related to the measured flatband potentials by considering the effects of specific adsorption of potential\u2010determining ions (for metal oxides used in photoelectrolysis, these are usually OH\u2212 and H+). Methods are discussed for determining the pH at which net adsorbed surface charge and thus potential across the Helmholtz layer is zero (point of zero zeta potential, pzzp). This pH value is shown to correlate with the electronegativity of the metal oxides. The application of these ideas to other semiconductor\u2010electrolyte systems is discussed.",

They are employed in applications that range from crystalline-Si heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) cells to organic PV polymer solar cells. The desirable characteristics of TCO materials that are common to all PV technologies are similar to the requirements for TCOs for flat-panel display applications and include high optical transmissivity across a wide spectrum and low resistivity. Additionally, TCOs for terrestrial PV applications must use low-cost materials, and some may require device-technology-specific properties. We review the fundamentals of TCOs and the matrix of TCO properties and processing as they apply to current and future PV \u2026",

            "Organic semiconductor-based photovoltaic devices offer the promise of a low-cost photovoltaic technology that could be manufactured via large-scale, roll-to-roll printing techniques. Existing organic photovoltaic devices have currently achieved solar power conversion efficiencies greater than 3%. Although encouraging, the reasons higher efficiencies have not been achieved are poor overlap between the absorption spectrum of the organic chromophores and the solar spectrum, non-ideal band alignment between the donor and acceptor species, and low charge carrier mobilities resulting from the disordered nature of organic semiconductors. To address the latter issues, we are investigating the development of nanostructured oxide\/conjugated polymer composite photovoltaic (PV) devices. These composites can take advantage of the high electron mobilities attainable in oxide semiconductors and can be \u2026",

            "Irradiation of an n-type semiconductor SrTi03 electrode in an electrochemical cell is shown toresult in the sus-tained conversion of H20 to H2 and 02. In 9.5 M NaOH oxidation occurs at the photoelectrode at potentials more positive than ca.-1.3 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and H2 evolution is observed at the Pt electrode which is not illumi-nated. Results reported herein show for the first time that the electrolysis of H20 can be driven photochemically without any external bias. The photoeffect obtains upon irradiation withlight of shorter wavelength than 390 nm which corresponds closely to the known absorption edge for thevalence band to conduction band transition in SrTi03. The photocurrent reaches its maximum value near 330 nm and the response is nearly constant with increasing excitation energy. Quantum efficiency for electron flow is found to be 1.0\u00b10.20 upon irradiation with light of shorter \u2026",
