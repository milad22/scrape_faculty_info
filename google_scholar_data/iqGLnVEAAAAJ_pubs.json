            "In recent years, evidence for the existence of an ultracompact concentration of dark mass associated with the radio source Sagittarius A* in the Galactic center has become very strong. However, unambiguous proof that this object is indeed a black hole is still lacking. A defining characteristic of a black hole is the event horizon. To a distant observer, the event horizon casts a relatively large \u201cshadow\u201d with an apparent diameter of \u223c10 gravitational radii that is due to the bending of light by the black hole, and this shadow is nearly independent of the black hole spin or orientation. The predicted size (\u223c30 \u03bcas) of this shadow for Sgr A* approaches the resolution of current radio interferometers. If the black hole is maximally spinning and viewed edge\u2010on, then the shadow will be offset by \u223c8 \u03bcas from the center of mass and will be slightly flattened on one side. Taking into account the scatter broadening of the image in \u2026",

            "The inner few parsecs at the Galactic Center have come under intense scrutiny in recent years, in part due to the exciting broad-band observations of this region, but also because of the growing interest from theorists motivated to study the physics of black hole accretion, magnetized gas dynamics, and unusual star formation. The Galactic Center is now known to contain arguably the most compelling supermassive black hole candidate, weighing in at a little over 2.6 million suns. Its interaction with the nearby environment, comprised of clusters of evolved and young stars, a molecular dusty ring, ionized gas streamers, diffuse hot gas, and a hypernova remnant, is providing a wealth of accretion phenomenology and high-energy processes for detailed modeling. In this review, we summarize the latest observational results and focus on the physical interpretation of the most intriguing object in this region\u2014the \u2026",

In recent years, observations have largely confirmed many of the properties of this model, which are based on a partitioning of the universe\u2019s energy density into three primary constituents: matter, radiation and a hypothesized dark energy which, in \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM), is assumed to be a cosmological constant \u039b. Yet with this progress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have emerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of these is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon Rh(t0) with the distance ct0 light has travelled since the big bang, in terms of the current age t0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not have occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right \u2026",

We compute the Compton-drag deceleration of an initially hyperrelativistic jet for a variety of disk and outflow parameters. The resulting beamed spectrum of the upscattered disk photons is derived self-consistently by a Monte Carlo technique.

            "The cosmological principle, promoting the view that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic, is embodied within the mathematical structure of the Robertson\u2013Walker (RW) metric. The equations derived from an application of this metric to the Einstein Field Equations describe the expansion of the Universe in terms of comoving coordinates, from which physical distances may be derived using a time-dependent expansion factor. These coordinates, however, do not explicitly reveal the properties of the cosmic space\u2013time manifested in Birkhoff's theorem and its corollary. In this paper, we compare two forms of the metric \u2013 written in (the traditional) comoving coordinates, and a set of observer-dependent coordinates \u2013 first for the well-known de Sitter universe containing only dark energy, and then for a newly derived form of the RW metric, for a universe with dark energy and matter. We show that Rindler's event \u2026",
