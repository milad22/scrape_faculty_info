            "We have observed Bose-Einstein condensation of sodium atoms. The atoms were trapped in a novel trap that employed both magnetic and optical forces. Evaporative cooling increased the phase-space density by 6 orders of magnitude within seven seconds. Condensates contained up to 5\u00d7 10 5 atoms at densities exceeding 10 14 cm\u2212 3. The striking signature of Bose condensation was the sudden appearance of a bimodal velocity distribution below the critical temperature of\u223c 2\u03bcK. The distribution consisted of an isotropic thermal distribution and an elliptical core attributed to the expansion of a dense condensate.",

High-contrast matter-wave interference fringes with a period of \u223c15 micrometers were observed after switching off the potential and letting the condensates expand for 40 milliseconds and overlap. This demonstrates that Bose condensed atoms are \u201claser-like\u201d; that is, they are coherent and show long-range correlations.

Magnetic traps are usually employed to confine the condensates, but have the drawback that spin flips in the atoms lead to untrapped states. For this reason, the spin orientation of the trapped alkali atoms cannot be regarded as a degree of freedom. Such condensates are therefore described by a scalar order parameter, like the spinless superfluid 4 He. In contrast, a recently realized optical trap 4 for sodium condensates confines atoms independently of their spin orientations. This offers the possibility of studying \u2018spinor\u2019condensates in which spin comprises a degree of freedom, so that the order parameter is a vector rather than scalar quantity.

            "Properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate were studied by stimulated, two-photon Bragg scattering. The high momentum and energy resolution of this method allowed a spectroscopic measurement of the mean-field energy and of the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of the condensate. The coherence length of the condensate was shown to be equal to its size. Bragg spectroscopy can be used to determine the dynamic structure factor over a wide range of energy and momentum transfers.",

            "Collective excitations of a dilute Bose condensate have been observed. These excitations are analogous to phonons in superfluid helium. Bose condensates were created by evaporatively cooling magnetically trapped sodium atoms. Excitations were induced by a modulation of the trapping potential, and detected as shape oscillations in the freely expanding condensates. The frequencies of the lowest modes agreed well with theoretical predictions based on mean-field theory. Before the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation, we observed sound waves in a dense ultracold gas.",
