            "The theory of polyhedral surfaces and, more generally, the field of discrete differential geometry are presently emerging on the border of differential and discrete geometry. Whereas classical differential geometry investigates smooth geometric shapes (such as surfaces), and discrete geometry studies geometric shapes with a finite number of elements (polyhedra), the theory of polyhedral surfaces aims at a development of discrete equivalents of the geometric notions and methods of surface theory. The latter appears then as a limit of the refinement of the discretization. Current progress in this field is to a large extent stimulated by its relevance for computer graphics and visualization. One of the central problems of discrete differential geometry is to find proper discrete analogues of special classes of surfaces, such as minimal, con stant mean curvature, isothermic surfaces, etc. Usually, one can suggest vari ous \u2026",

The basis of our model is a lesser-known characterization of developable surfaces as manifolds that can be parameterized through orthogonal geodesics. Our model is simple and local, and, unlike in previous works, it does not directly encode the surface rulings. This allows us to model continuous deformations of discrete developable surfaces independently of their decomposition into torsal and planar patches or the surface topology. We prove and experimentally demonstrate strong ties to smooth developable surfaces, including a theorem stating that every sampling of the smooth counterpart satisfies our constraints up to second order. We further present an extension of our model that enables a local definition of discrete isometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our discrete model in \u2026",
