            "This review describes recent research into the properties of the chromophore-TiO2 interface that forms the basis for photoinduced charge separation in dye-sensitized semiconductor solar cells. It focuses particularly on an atomistic picture of the electron-injection dynamics. The interface offers an excellent case study, pertinent as well to a variety of other photovoltaic systems, photo- and electrochemistry, molecular electronics, analytical detection, photography, and quantum confinement devices. The differences between chemists\u2019 and physicists\u2019 models for describing molecules and bulk materials, respectively, create challenges for the characterization of interfaces that include both of these components. We give an overall picture of the interface by starting with a description of the properties of the chromophores and semiconductor separately, and then by discussing the coupled system, including the chromophore \u2026",

            "Molecular dynamics simulations of many degree of freedom systems are often comprised of classical evolutions on quantum adiabatic energy surfaces with intermittent instantaneous hops from one surface to another. However, since quantum transitions are inherently nonadiabatic processes, the adiabatic approximation underlying the classical equations of motion does not hold in the regions where quantum transitions take place, and the restriction to classical trajectories for adiabatic quantum states is an approximation. Alternatives which employ classical paths that account more fully for nonadiabaticity can be computationally expensive and algorithmically complicated. Here, we propose a new method, which combines the surface hopping idea with the mean-field approximation for classical paths. Applied to three test systems, the method is shown to outperform the methods based on an adiabatic force without \u2026",

By applying the classical path approximation to the fewest switches surface hopping approach, we have developed an efficient computational tool that can be applied to study photoinduced dynamics at the ab initio level in systems composed of hundreds of atoms and involving thousands of electronic states. The technique is used to study in detail the ultrafast relaxation of hot electrons in crystalline pentacene. The simulated relaxation occurs on a 500 fs time scale, in excellent agreement with experiment, and is driven by molecular lattice vibrations in the 200\u2013250 cm\u20131 frequency range.

The quantum decoherence time proves to be a key ingredient in the production of accurate nonadiabatic dynamics from computer simulations. Based on a short time expansion to a semiclassical golden rule expression due to Neria and Nitzan [J. Chem. Phys. 99, 1109 (1993)], we develop a new computationally efficient method for estimating the decay of quantum coherence in condensed phase molecular simulations. Using the hydrated electron as an example, application of this method finds that quantum decoherence times are on the order of a few femtoseconds for condensed phase chemical systems and that they play a direct role in determining nonadiabatic transition rates. The decay of quantum coherence for the solvated electron is found to take \u224a50 \u2026",

Electronic dynamics in the Hilbert space takes the form of a unitary evolution, intermittent with stochastic decoherence events that are manifested as a localization toward (adiabatic) basis states. Classical particles evolve along a single potential energy surface and can switch surfaces only at the decoherence events. Thus, decoherence provides physical justification of surface hopping, obviating the need for ad hoc surface hopping rules. The method is tested with model problems, showing good \u2026",

            "The impact of quantum decoherence and zero point motion on non-adiabatic transition rates in condensed matter systems is studied in relation to non-adiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics (MD) techniques. Both effects, and decoherence in particular, strongly influence the transition rate, while neither is accounted for by straightforward quantum-classical approaches. Quantum corrections to the quantum-classical results are rigorously introduced based on Kubo\u2019s generating function formulation of Fermi\u2019s Golden rule and the frozen Gaussian approximation for the nuclear wave functions. The development provides a one-to-one correspondence between the decoherence function and the Franck\u2013Condon factor. The decoherence function defined in this paper corrects an error in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 104, 5942 (1996)]. The relationship between the short time approach and the real time NA MD is \u2026",
