            "Salient stimuli redirect attention and suppress ongoing motor activity. This attentional shift is thought to rely upon thalamic signals to the striatum to shift cortically driven action selection, but the network mechanisms underlying this interaction are unclear. Using a brain slice preparation that preserved cortico- and thalamostriatal connectivity, it was found that activation of thalamostriatal axons in a way that mimicked the response to salient stimuli induced a burst of spikes in striatal cholinergic interneurons that was followed by a pause lasting more than half a second. This patterned interneuron activity triggered a transient, presynaptic suppression of cortical input to both major classes of principal medium spiny neuron (MSN) that gave way to a prolonged enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness in striatopallidal MSNs controlling motor suppression. This differential regulation of the corticostriatal circuitry provides a \u2026",

Current models of PD thus hypothesize that increased inhibitory pallidal output reduces firing rates in frontal cortex, including MI, resulting in akinesia and muscle rigidity. We recorded the simultaneous spontaneous discharge of several neurons in the arm-related area of MI of two monkeys and in the globus pallidus (GP) of one of the two. Accelerometers were fastened to the forelimbs to detect movement, and surface electromyograms were recorded from the contralateral arm of one monkey. The recordings were conducted before and after systemic treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rendering the animals severely akinetic and rigid with little or no tremor.

            "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) for many patients. The most effective stimulation consists of high-frequency biphasic stimulation pulses around 130 Hz delivered between two active sites of an implanted depth electrode to the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Multiple studies have shown that a key effect of STN-DBS that correlates well with clinical outcome is the reduction of synchronous and oscillatory activity in cortical and basal ganglia networks. We hypothesized that antidromic cortical activation may provide an underlying mechanism responsible for this effect, because stimulation is usually performed in proximity to cortical efferent pathways. We show with intracellular cortical recordings in rats that STN-DBS did in fact lead to antidromic spiking of deep layer cortical neurons. Furthermore, antidromic spikes triggered a dampened oscillation of local field potentials \u2026",

            "Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose symptoms are caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons innervating the striatum. As striatal dopamine levels fall, striatal acetylcholine release rises, exacerbating motor symptoms. This adaptation is commonly attributed to the loss of interneuronal regulation by inhibitory D 2 dopamine receptors. Our results point to a completely different, new mechanism. After striatal dopamine depletion, D 2 dopamine receptor modulation of calcium (Ca 2+) channels controlling vesicular acetylcholine release in interneurons was unchanged, but M 4 muscarinic autoreceptor coupling to these same channels was markedly attenuated. This adaptation was attributable to the upregulation of RGS4\u2014an autoreceptor-associated, GTPase-accelerating protein. This specific signaling adaptation extended to a broader loss of autoreceptor control of interneuron spiking. These \u2026",

            "The factors governing neuronal loss in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) are the subject of continuing speculation and experimental study. In recent years, factors that act on most or all cell types (pan-cellular factors), particularly genetic mutations and environmental toxins, have dominated public discussions of disease aetiology. Although there is compelling evidence supporting an association between disease risk and these factors, the pattern of neuronal pathology and cell loss is difficult to explain without cell-specific factors. This chapter focuses on recent studies showing that the neurons at greatest risk in PD \u2013 substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons \u2013 have a distinctive physiological phenotype that could contribute to their vulnerability. The opening of L-type calcium channels during autonomous pacemaking results in sustained calcium entry into the cytoplasm of SNc DA neurons, resulting in \u2026",
