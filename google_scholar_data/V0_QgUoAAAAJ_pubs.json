            "Historic and ongoing sediment contamination adversely affects estuaries, among the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. However, all estuaries are not the same, and estuarine sediments cannot be treated as either fresh or marine sediments or properly assessed without understanding both seasonal and spatial estuarine variability and processes, which are reviewed. Estuaries are physicochemically unique, primarily because of their variable salinity but also because of their strong gradients in other parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and amount and composition of particles. Salinity (overlying and interstitial) varies spatially (laterally, vertically) and temporally and is the controlling factor for partitioning of contaminants between sediments and overlying or interstitial water. Salinity also controls the distribution and types of estuarine biota. Benthic infauna are \u2026",

The resulting data are often used to characterize chemical accumulations, including delineation of \u2018hotspots\u2019.

Direct biological testing is needed. the use of a Sediment Quality Triad (chemical, bioassay and infauna) of measurements is advocated here by the authors. The purpose of this study was to determine the correspondence among measures of the three components of the Triad, using available data from several studies of Puget Sound. Good overall correspondence among the three components of the Triad was observed, based upon a comparison of average values from urban and rural portions of the Sound \u2026",

Effects can include lethal, sublethal, chronic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, population or community responses, but do not include bioaccumulation per se, which is a phenomenon, not an effect.

The individual approaches include background sediment chemistry, water quality criteria, sediment\/water equilibrium partitioning, sediment bioas\u2010say, screening level concentration, apparent effects threshold and sediment quality triad. Based on the evaluation of the two groups and seven individual approaches, it is concluded that, for chemical\u2010by\u2010chemical criteria, the equilibrium partitioning method shows promise; for criteria that are also applicable to chemical mixtures, the apparent effects threshold\/sediment quality triad approaches appear to be most appropriate.

This approach consists of synoptic measurements of sediment contamination by chemical analyses, sediment toxicity through bioassays, and benthic infaunal community structure through taxonomic analyses of macroinfauna. Each component of the Triad complements the other 2 and together all 3 components provide an objective assessment of pollution-induced degradation. The underlying hypothesis is that no component can be used to predict measurements of the other 2 components. Sediment samples were collected at 3 stations at each of 3 sites in San Francisco Bay, USA \u2013 Islais Waterway, near Oakland, and in San Pablo Bay \u2013 and subjected to 4 separate, replicated sediment bioassays, comprehensive sediment chemistry analyses (no replication), and replicated benthic infaunal analyses.
