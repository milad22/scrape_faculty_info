As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of\u223c 28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42\u201353 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences \u2026",

We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore.

            "We measured Newton's gravitational constant G using a new torsion balance method. Our technique greatly reduces several sources of uncertainty compared to previous measurements:(1) It is insensitive to anelastic torsion fiber properties;(2) a flat plate pendulum minimizes the sensitivity due to the pendulum density distribution;(3) continuous attractor rotation reduces background noise. We obtain G=(6.674215\u00b10.000092)\u00d7 10\u2212 11 m 3 kg\u2212 1 s\u2212 2; the Earth's mass is, therefore, M\u2295=(5.972245\u00b10.000082)\u00d7 10 24 kg and the Sun's mass is M\u2299=(1.988435\u00b10.000027)\u00d7 10 30 kg.",
