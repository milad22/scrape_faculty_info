Amelioration of this noise requires near simultaneous strain measurements on more than one interferometer baseline, necessitating, for example, more than two satellites for a space-based detector or two interferometer arms for a ground-based detector. We describe a new detection strategy based on recent advances in optical atomic clocks and atom interferometry which can operate at long baselines and which is immune to laser frequency noise. Laser frequency noise is suppressed because the signal arises strictly from the light propagation time between two ensembles of atoms. This new class of sensor allows sensitive gravitational wave detection with only a single baseline. This approach also has practical applications in, for example, the development of ultrasensitive \u2026",

We begin by explaining the nonrelativistic calculation of the phase shift in an atom interferometer and deriving its range of validity. From this, we develop a method for calculating the phase shift in general relativity. Both the atoms and the light are treated relativistically and all coordinate dependencies are removed, thus revealing novel terms, cancellations, and new origins for previously calculated terms. This formalism is then used to find the relativistic effects in an atom interferometer in a weak gravitational field for application to laboratory tests of general relativity. The potentially testable relativistic effects include the nonlinear three-graviton coupling, the gravity of kinetic energy, and the falling of light.
