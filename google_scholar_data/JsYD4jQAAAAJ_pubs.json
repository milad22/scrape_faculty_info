            "Breast cancer is a group of clinically, histopathologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases, with different outcomes and responses to treatment. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancers are defined as tumors that lack the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor 2. This subgroup accounts for 15% of all types of breast cancer and its prevalence is higher among young African, African-American and Latino women. The hypermethylation of CpG islands (CpGI) is a common epigenetic alteration for suppressing gene expression in breast cancer and has been shown to be a key factor in breast carcinogenesis. In this study we analyzed the hypermethylation of 110 CpGI within 69 cancer-related genes in TN tumors. For the methylation analysis, we used the methyl-specific multiplex-ligation probe amplification assay. We found that the number of methylated CpGI is \u2026",

Identification of aberrantly methylated genes in breast tumors and their relation to clinical parameters can contribute to improved diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision making. Our objective in the present study was to identify the methylation status of 34 cancer-involved genes in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). Each of the 70 IDC cases analyzed had a unique methylation profile. The highest methylation frequency was detected in the WT1 (95.7%) and RASSF1 (71.4%) genes.

To meet this challenge, here we profile DNA methylomes of the three most frequent types of brain metastases: melanoma, breast, and lung cancers (n= 96). Using supervised machine learning and integration of DNA methylomes from normal, primary, and metastatic tumor specimens (n= 1860), we unravel epigenetic signatures specific to each type of metastatic brain tumor and constructed a three-step DNA methylation-based classifier (BrainMETH) that categorizes brain metastases according to the tissue of origin and therapeutically relevant subtypes. BrainMETH predictions are supported by routine histopathologic evaluation.

A major source of phenotypic variability is alternative splicing (AS) of the pre-messenger RNA. This process is catalyzed by one of the most complex pieces of cellular molecular regulatory events, the spliceosome, which is composed of ribonucleoproteins and polypeptides termed spliceosome factors. With strong evidence indicating that AS affects nearly all genes encoded by the human genome, aberrant AS programs have a significant impact on cancer cell development and progression. In this review, we present insights about the genomic and epigenomic factors affecting AS, summarize the most recent findings linking aberrant AS to metastatic progression, and highlight potential prognostic and therapeutic applications.",
