In this Part, we outline the particle-physics program that can be achieved with Project X, a staged superconducting linac for intensity-frontier particle physics. Topics include neutrino physics, kaon physics, muon physics, electric dipole moments, neutron-antineutron oscillations, new light particles, hadron structure, hadron spectroscopy, and lattice-QCD calculations. Part 1 is available as arXiv: 1306.5022 [physics. acc-ph] and Part 3 is available as arXiv: 1306.5024 [physics. acc-ph].",

Using the WKB approximation, we obtain the frequencies of scalar and gravitational perturbations both analytically and numerically for arbitrary brane tension. We thus extend earlier analytical results which were derived for a brane of small tension.",

A diode-like behaviour of the junction current has been observed in this low-bias region at all temperatures but with a rather large reverse (leakage) current I R, particularly at high temperatures (I R\u22482 \u03bcA at V = \u22120:3V and T = 290 K). The forward \u2018voltage factor\u2019 A (T) was found to decrease with increasing temperature as A (T)\u2248q\/\u03b7k B T, with relatively high values of the \u2018ideality factor\u2019 \u03b7(about 3.5\u20134), probably due to the existence of an interfacial layer. The temperature dependence of the measured junction current (forward and reverse) flowing at low bias voltages and of the forward \u2018current factor\u2019 I 0F can be described \u2026",

Acceptor-doped lanthanum orthophosphates are considered for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for their potential stability and conductivity at high temperature. By exploring the crystal and defect structure of x% Sr\/Ca-doped LaPO4 with different nominal Sr\/Ca concentrations (x = 0\u201310) with neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), we confirm that Sr\/Ca-doped LaPO4 can exist as self-supported structures at high temperatures during solid oxide fuel cell operation. Thermal stability, surface topography, and size distribution are also studied to better understand the proton conductivity for dry and wet compounds obtained at sintering temperatures ranging from 1200 to 1400 \u00b0C using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic \u2026",

Using such a cell, chemical, dynamical, and physical changes can be studied in situ under various operating conditions. While the cell combined with portable automated gas environment system is especially useful for in situ studies of microscopic dynamics under operational conditions that are similar to those of solid oxide fuel cells, it can additionally be used to study a wide variety of materials, such as high temperature proton conductors.
