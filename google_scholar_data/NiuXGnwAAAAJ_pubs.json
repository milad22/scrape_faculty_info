            "When students answer an in-class conceptual question individually using clickers, discuss it with their neighbors, and then revote on the same question, the percentage of correct answers typically increases. This outcome could result from gains in understanding during discussion, or simply from peer influence of knowledgeable students on their neighbors. To distinguish between these alternatives in an undergraduate genetics course, we followed the above exercise with a second, similar (isomorphic) question on the same concept that students answered individually. Our results indicate that peer discussion enhances understanding, even when none of the students in a discussion group originally knows the correct answer.",

            "The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) is a new instrument designed to measure student beliefs about physics and about learning physics. This instrument extends previous work by probing additional aspects of student beliefs and by using wording suitable for students in a wide variety of physics courses. The CLASS has been validated using interviews, reliability studies, and extensive statistical analyses of responses from over 5000 students. In addition, a new methodology for determining useful and statistically robust categories of student beliefs has been developed. This paper serves as the foundation for an extensive study of how student beliefs impact and are impacted by their educational experiences. For example, this survey measures the following: that most teaching practices cause substantial drops in student scores; that a student\u2019s likelihood of becoming a physics major \u2026",

The direct current circuit laboratory was modified to compare the effects of using computer simulations with the effects of using real light bulbs, meters, and wires. Two groups of students, those who used real equipment and those who used a computer simulation that explicitly modeled electron flow, were compared in terms of their mastery of physics concepts and skills with real equipment. Students who used the simulated equipment outperformed their counterparts both on a conceptual survey of the domain and in the coordinated tasks of assembling a real circuit and describing how it worked.",

            "Downloaded from greater conceptual learning than did the standard demonstration (2). We have also conducted more than 250 interviews of individual students using PhET simulations in a think-aloud format. These interviews reveal how and why students interact with simulations and how this interaction leads to learning (7, 8). First, students find the simulations to be fun and intellectually engaging. Students (and teachers) will spontaneously play for hours with some simulations in educationally productive ways. We have identified a number of characteristics that make a simulation this engaging, many of which are what make video games engaging (9). These include (i) dynamic visual environments that are directly controlled by the user,(ii) challenges that are neither too hard nor too easy, and (iii) enough visual complexity to create curiosity without being overwhelming. Items (ii) and (iii) are best developed through iteration and testing with students.We find that students are not able to make sense of the science in the simulation just from watching. They must interact actively with the simulation. Most of the learning occurs when the student is asking herself questions that guide her exploration of the simulation and her discovery of the answers. When students engage in such self-driven exploration, they learn better. For example, nonscience students with no prior knowledge of physics are able to provide quite good explanations of an electromagnetic wave after less than an hour playing with the \u201cRadio Waves\u201d simulation.(Even physics majors have a hard time explaining electromagnetic waves after a year of physics.)
