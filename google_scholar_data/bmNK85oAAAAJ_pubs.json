            "Solitary waves are lumps of energy. We consider the study of dynamical solitary waves, meaning cases where the energy lumps are moving, as opposed to topological solitary waves where the lumps may be static. Solitary waves have been studied in some form or the other for nearly 450 years. Subsequently, there have been many authoritative works on solitary waves. Nevertheless, some of the most recent studies reveal that these peculiar objects are far more complex than what we might have given them credit for. In this review, we introduce the physics of solitary waves in alignments of elastic beads, such as glass beads or stainless steel beads. We show that any impulse propagates as a new kind of highly interactive solitary wave through such an alignment and that the existence of these waves seems to present a need to re-examine the very definition of the concept of equilibrium. We further discuss the \u2026",

By designing a nonintrusive force sensor to measure the impulse as it propagates along the chain, we study the solitary wave reflection at a wall. We show that the main features of solitary wave reflection depend on wall mechanical properties. Since previous studies on solitary waves have been performed at walls without these considerations, our experiment provides a more reliable tool to characterize solitary wave propagation.

An impact of a large striker on a monodisperse chain, and similarly a sharp decrease of bead radius in a stepped chain, generates a solitary wave train containing many single solitary waves ordered by decreasing amplitudes. We find, by simple analytical arguments, that the unloading of compression force at the chain edge has a nearly exponential decrease. The characteristic time is mainly a function involving the grains\u2019 masses and the striker mass. Numerical calculations and experiments corroborate these findings.",

Our results show that robust solitonlike pulses carry the initial perturbation from the surface to the depths of the Hertzian chains for various magnitudes of the initial perturbation at finite loadings of the column. In addition, we probe the structural characteristics of the solitonlike pulse as a function of the magnitude of the initial impact, of loading, and of the gravitational field.

            "We report particle dynamics based studies of impulse propagation in a chain of elastic beads with dissipative contacts and with randomly distributed masses. The interaction between the beads is characterized by the potential V(\u03b4)\u223c\u03b4n, \u03b4\u22650 being grain overlap, n>2 and at zero external loading, i.e., under conditions of \u201csonic vacuum\u201d in which sound cannot propagate through the chain [J. Appl. Mech. Technol. Phys. 5 (1983) 733]. In the earlier work, we have confirmed the studies of Nesterenko and coworkers and have reported that impulses propagate as solitary waves in the system of interest in the absence of dissipation and disorder [Physica A 268 (1999) 644]. In the present study, we first discuss the effects of restitution and velocity dependent friction on the propagation of the impulse. We next report that the maximum energy Emax of the solitary wave as it propagates from a chain of monodisperse grains of \u2026",
