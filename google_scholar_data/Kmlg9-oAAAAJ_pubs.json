            "The state-of-the-art in modelling the influence of corrosion damage on the ultimate strength of aged steel-plated maritime platforms is reviewed. This critical review outlines the corrosion mechanisms and fundamentals of steel-plated structures in the marine environment. Recent developments in mathematical modelling strategies, in association with in situ thickness measurements, have significantly enhanced the qualitative understanding of the corrosion processes at various locations within marine structures. Based on the corrosion prediction, both experimental and numerical methods have been adopted to realistically assess the ultimate strength of such corroded steel ship structures, in order to ultimately improve the survey and repair strategies.",

A finite element analysis is used to investigate the effect of random corrosion on the compressive strength capacity of marine structural units. Variables include the extent of corrosion; slenderness ratio and aspect ratio. A corrosion prediction model is incorporated to determine the thickness reduction with time. Corrosion-induced volume loss results in a greater reduction of ultimate strength for slender plates compared to stiffened panels, up to 45%, showing the structural element selection can strongly influence the accuracy of the estimated corrosion damage effect.",

The model includes the effects of different initial geometric imperfections and weld-induced residual stresses. The influence of corrosion damage on the load shortening curves and ultimate strength is investigated. It is shown that grooving corrosion depth has a greater influence on structural performance as compared with corrosion width for the same volume loss. Such corrosion damage could cause a significant reduction in the ultimate strength of a plate panel. Considerations of weld-induced deflection and residual stresses further enhance the corrosion influence on the strength capacity.",

The numerical simulation based on the presented algorithm was then developed and the dynamic behavior was investigated. A theoretical solution setup with simple model was solved to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed lumped-mass model. Based on this model, the coupled natural frequencies and the maximum acceleration of each direction were determined. Experimental tests were conducted to validate the applicability of the numerical model, over a range of rotational speeds and loading conditions. It is found that the natural frequencies are unaffected while the maximum acceleration are increased with the rotational speed as well as the loading. Natural frequencies representing other directions are induced by the coupling effect \u2026",

Results show that mechanical stimuli (elastic\/plastic deformation) increase the local anodic current density, and thus the corrosion behavior dynamically responds to the loading conditions. The current density increment for a multi-component stress system is largely dependent on both hydrostatic pressure and equivalent plastic strain. Moreover, the mechano-electrochemical corrosion is more affected by plastic deformation, resulting in localized areas being more anodic. Existing corrosion introduces extra stress\/strain concentration, which further reduces the structural strength capacity and intensifies the corrosion damage.",

Various vibrations coupling with each other can significantly influence the dynamical behavior of the shaft and threaten the reliability of ships. This paper presents a finite element analysis model with multiple constraint conditions to analyze the coupled transverse and longitudinal vibrations of a marine propulsion shaft. Based on this model, in addition to the coupled natural frequencies of each direction, the maximum acceleration are also determined. Furthermore, the simulation of an idling and loading vibration analysis is discussed and validated against experimental results, over a range of rotational speeds.

Four location patterns of one-sided corroded shipping steel plates have been considered, which include both geometric and material non-linearities. Validation of the modeling method is achieved by a thermoelastic stress analysis, which provides the principal stress distribution over the plate surface. The modeling results demonstrate that the frequently detected localized corrosion may reduce the ultimate strength by up to 20% compared to uniformly corroded plate. In addition, bench-shaped pits may further decrease the ultimate strength by up to 14% compared to the no-bench condition with the same degree of pitting.",
