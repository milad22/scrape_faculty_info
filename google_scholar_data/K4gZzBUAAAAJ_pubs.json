The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are distinguished from other hydrogen-deficient objects by their spectacular dust formation episodes. They may decline by up to 8 magnitudes in a few weeks revealing a rich emission-line spectrum. Their atmospheres have unusual abundances with very little hydrogen and an overabundance of carbon and nitrogen. The RCB stars are thought to be the product of a final helium shell flash or the coalescence of a binary white-dwarf system. Dust may form in non-equilibrium conditions created behind shocks caused by pulsations in the atmospheres of these stars. The RCB stars are interesting and important, first because they represent a rare, or short-lived stage of stellar evolution, and second because these stars regularly produce large amounts of dust so they are laboratories for the study \u2026",

The observations reveal the presence of a population of cold dust grains radiating with a temperature of about 17 to 23 kelvin at a rate of about 220 times the luminosity of the Sun. The intensity and spectral energy distribution of the emission suggest a dust mass of about 0.4 to 0.7 times the mass of the Sun. The radiation must originate from the supernova ejecta and requires the efficient precipitation of all refractory material into dust. Our observations imply that supernovae can produce the large dust masses detected in young galaxies at very high redshifts.",

In addition, we benefited from the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the NEWSIPS International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) data and the larger sample of SMC stars now available. Searching the IUE Final Archive, we found only four suitable early-type stars that were significantly reddened and had well-matched comparison stars.

Our new analysis takes advantage of the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the IUE NEWSIPS reduction, the exclusion of stars with very low reddening, the careful selection of well-matched comparison stars, and an analysis of the effects of Galactic foreground dust. Differences between the average extinction curves of the 30 Dor region and the rest of the LMC are reduced compared with previous studies. We find that there is a group of stars with very weak 2175 \u00c5 bumps that lie in or near the region occupied by the supergiant shell, LMC 2, on the southeast side of 30 Dor. The average extinction curves inside and outside LMC 2 show a very significant difference in 2175 \u00c5 bump strength, but their far-UV extinctions are similar. While it is unclear whether or not the extinction outside the LMC 2 \u2026",
