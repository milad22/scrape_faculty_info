            "The intriguing many-body phases of quantum matter arise from the interplay of particle interactions, spatial symmetries, and external fields. Generating these phases in an engineered system could provide deeper insight into their nature. Using superconducting qubits, we simultaneously realize synthetic magnetic fields and strong particle interactions, which are among the essential elements for studying quantum magnetism and fractional quantum Hall phenomena. The artificial magnetic fields are synthesized by sinusoidally modulating the qubit couplings. In a closed loop formed by the three qubits, we observe the directional circulation of photons, a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate strong interactions through the creation of photon vacancies, or \u2018holes\u2019, which circulate in the opposite direction. The combination of these key elements results in chiral ground-state currents. Our work \u2026",

Very similar patterns are observed when initially uniform streams of dry granular material break up into clusters of grains 4, 5, 6, even though flows of macroscopic particles are considered to lack surface tension 7, 8. Recent studies on freely falling granular streams tracked fluctuations in the stream profile 9, but the clustering mechanism remained unresolved because the full evolution of the instability could not be observed. Here we demonstrate that the cluster formation is driven by minute, nanoNewton cohesive forces that arise from a combination of van der Waals interactions and capillary bridges between nanometre-scale surface asperities. Our experiments involve high-speed video imaging of the granular stream in the co-moving frame, control over the properties \u2026",

The hopping matrix elements in our model fall off as a Gaussian, and when the flux per plaquette is small compared to the fundamental flux quantum one only needs to include nearest and next-nearest neighbor hoppings.

Many of these states are gapped and exhibit anyon excitations, which could be used for a robust form of quantum information processing. However, while numerous qubit array proposals exist to engineer the Hamiltonian for these systems, the question of how to stabilize the many-body ground state of these photonic quantum simulators against photon losses remains largely unanswered. We here propose a simple mechanism that achieves this goal for Abelian and non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states of light.

Additionally, the coupling can be dynamically modulated, allowing for single-photon exchange in 6 ns. Qubit coherence times exceeding 20 \u03bc s are maintained over the majority of the range of tuning, limited primarily by the Purcell effect.
