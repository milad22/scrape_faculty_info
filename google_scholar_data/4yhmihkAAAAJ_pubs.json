The increase in detector count is made possible by lenslet-coupled trichroic polarization-sensitive pixels fabricated at Argonne National Laboratory, new 68 frequency-domain multiplexing readout electronics, and a higher-throughput optical design. The enhanced sensitivity of SPT-3G will enable a wide range of results including constraints on primordial B-mode polarization, measurements of gravitational lensing of the CMB, and a galaxy cluster survey.

            "The desire for higher sensitivity has driven ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments to employ ever larger focal planes, which in turn require larger reimaging optics. Practical limits to the maximum size of these optics motivates the development of quasi-optically-coupled (lenslet-coupled), multi-chroic detectors. These detectors can be sensitive across a broader bandwidth compared to waveguide-coupled detectors. However, the increase in bandwidth comes at a cost: the lenses (up to ~700 mm diameter) and lenslets (~5 mm diameter, hemispherical lenses on the focal plane) used in these systems are made from high-refractive-index materials (such as silicon or amorphous aluminum oxide) that reflect nearly a third of the incident radiation. In order to maximize the faint CMB signal that reaches the detectors, the lenses and lenslets must be coated with an anti-reflective (AR) material. The \u2026",
