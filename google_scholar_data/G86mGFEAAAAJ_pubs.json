            "Understanding electrical transport processes in molecules connected between metal electrodes is a central focus in the field of molecular electronics and is important for both potential applications and fundamental research purposes. This short review summarizes recent progress in assembling and measuring strategies for long conjugated molecular wires within molecular junctions, and introduces several new in situ methods to prepare molecular wires connected to electrodes. Following a brief introduction to charge transport mechanisms, particular examples of molecular wires in the recent literature are presented to discuss the influence of molecular length, temperature, and applied voltage on the transport properties with emphasis on the tunneling-to-hopping transition. The review concludes with an outlook on future hopping transport experiments in long conjugated molecular wires.",

Cancer nanotherapeutics have overcome several limitations of conventional therapies, such as nonspecific biodistribution, poor water solubility, and limited bioavailability. Nanoparticles with tuned size and surface characteristics are the key components of nanotherapeutics, and are designed to passively or actively deliver anti-cancer drugs to tumor cells.

At the lower end of the pressure range, the samples contain primarily monomer, as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction studies, but some polymerization does occur, leading to a pronounced color change from colorless to blue and to the development of intense Raman peaks at 962, 1394, and 2055 cm-1, corresponding to the poly(diacetylene).

We observed a clear transition in direct current (DC) transport from tunneling to hopping in a length range between 4 and 5 nm as previously established for oligoarylimine wires. Stepwise click cycloaddition represents a new efficient method to prepare long conjugated molecular wire self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au surfaces for conduction measurements and is expected to be compatible with a variety of functionalities and bonding architectures in the wire backbones.",

Adding a Lewis base to the blue PIDA suspension at room temperature leads first to rapid disappearance of the absorption peaks attributed to PIDA, followed more slowly by release of free iodine. The resulting solid material gives a Raman scattering spectrum consistent with graphitic carbon, and it has a much higher conductivity than PIDA itself. Further investigation has led to the discovery of a previously unreported transformation, the reaction of a Lewis base such as pyrrolidine with a trans-diiodoalkene to form the corresponding alkyne. The generality of this iodine elimination further suggests that reaction of PIDA with Lewis bases dehalogenates the polymer, presenting a new method to prepare carbon nanomaterials at room temperature under very mild conditions.",
