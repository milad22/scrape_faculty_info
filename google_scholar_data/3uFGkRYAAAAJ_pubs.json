The spectral and luminescent properties of nominally pure, dye-doped and dye-doped\/annealed at 150 \u00b0C crystals (KDP, KDP:XO and KDP:XOan) were measured. The annealing temperature effect on the degree of dye protonation in the crystal matrix is established. Analysis of the IR-absorption spectra reveals a strong interaction between the incorporated dye molecules and the hydrogen subsystem of the matrix. The nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of KDP, KDP:XO and KDP:XOan crystals are studied within the self-action effect of picosecond laser pulses at 532 nm. The mechanism of photoinduced bleaching and the effects of laser beam self-focusing (in KDP) and self-defocusing (in KDP:XO and KDP:XOan) are supposed to be due to \u2026",

The structure and composition of KDP:Urea crystal are studied by three\u2010crystal X\u2010ray diffraction analysis, which reveals the existence of a correlation between the increase of the microhardness value and the change of the crystal lattice parameter.

The pre-exponential factor and activation energy values of conductivity are determined for the crystals irradiated with various doses. Analysis of the dose and temperature dependences shows that the radiation-induced decrease of the conductivity is associated with the decrease of L-defect concentration in the crystal. The concentration changes in accordance with the law of first order kinetics at the range of \u03b3-irradiation doses of 3.0-10 y 6.3-10 Gy.

The incorporation of L-arg molecules into the crystal was verified by means of ninhydrin reaction. Undoped and L-arginine doped KDP crystals were characterized by XRD method and structure perfection of the doped crystals was shown o correspond to the one of pure KDP. It was established that incorporation of L-g molecules into KDP crystal had an effect on the formation of additional bonds in the crystal structure, that manifested itself in the thermal properties of the doped crystals. Investigation of \u03b5^\/\u03b5|| value which characterizes the dielectric permittivity anisotropy showed that it was minimal at 0.5-1.0 wt.% L-arg concentrations. In this case, the introduced L-arg seems to lead to creation of additional hydrogen bonds and disappearance of proton vacancies bound up with aliovalent impurities. Since the crystals contain different impurity defects, L-arg molecules are oriented in he lattice in a different way, depending on the type of the defects, and diminish the anisotropy. The present study testifies that the attenuation of the values of DC conductivity, dielectric permittivity and loss tangent at L-arg concentrations of 1 wt.% is probably related o the content decrease of the proton vacancies and the impurity-proton vacancy complexes dipoles, formed due to incorporation of the impurity ions into the crystal. The incorporation of L-arg molecules into the crystalline matrix results in an order of magnitude enhancement of he refractive nonlinear optical (NLO) response \u2026",
