The mechanism for this conductivity enhancement was studied through various chemical and physical characterizations. The PEDOT:PSS film which is soluble in water becomes insoluble after treatment with EG. This strongly suggests an increased interchain interaction among the PEDOT chains. Raman spectroscopy indicates that this increased interchain interaction results from conformational changes of the PEDOT chains, which change from a coil to linear or expanded-coil structure. The increased interchain interaction and conformation changes are further \u2026",

It is found that, with a buffer layer of suitable thickness, both current injection and electroluminescence output are significantly enhanced.

Two different pathways for the attachment of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing aryl groups to the 5-position of the quinolinolate ligand via Suzuki coupling were developed. A successful tuning in the emission color was achieved:\u2009 the emission wavelength was found to correlate with the Hammett constant of the respective substituents, providing a powerful strategy for prediction of the optical properties of new electroluminophores.

            "The unique electron\u2010transport and emissive properties of tris(8\u2010quinolinolate) aluminum(III) (Alq3) have resulted in extensive use of this material for small molecular organic light\u2010emitting diode (OLED) fabrication. So far, efforts to prepare stable and easy\u2010to\u2010process red\/green\/blue (RGB)\u2010emitting Alq3 derivatives have met with only a limited success. In this paper, we describe how the electronic nature of various substituents, projected via an arylethynyl or aryl spacer to the position of the highest HOMO density (C5), may be used for effective emission tuning to obtain blue\u2010, green\u2010, and red\u2010emitting materials. The synthetic strategy consists of four different pathways for the attachment of electron\u2010donating and electron\u2010withdrawing aryl or arylethynyl substituents to the 5\u2010position of the quinolinolate ring. Successful tuning of the emission color covering the whole visible spectrum (\u03bb=450\u2013800 nm) was achieved. In \u2026",
