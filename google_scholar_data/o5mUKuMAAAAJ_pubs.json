            "On board the four Cluster spacecraft, the Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS) experiment measures the full, three-dimensional ion distribution of the major magnetospheric ions (H+, He+, He++, and O+) from the thermal energies to about 40 keV\/e. The experiment consists of two different instruments: a COmposition and DIstribution Function analyser (CIS1\/CODIF), giving the mass per charge composition with medium (22.5\u00b0) angular resolution, and a Hot Ion Analyser (CIS2\/HIA), which does not offer mass resolution but has a better angular resolution (5.6\u00b0) that is adequate for ion beam and solar wind measurements. Each analyser has two different sensitivities in order to increase the dynamic range. First tests of the instruments (commissioning activities) were achieved from early September 2000 to mid January 2001, and the operation phase began on 1 February 2001. In this paper, first results of the CIS instruments are presented showing the high level performances and capabilities of the instruments. Good examples of data were obtained in the central plasma sheet, magnetopause crossings, magnetosheath, solar wind and cusp measurements. Observations in the auroral regions could also be obtained with the Cluster spacecraft at radial distances of 4\u20136 Earth radii. These results show the tremendous interest of multispacecraft measurements with identical instruments and open a new area in magnetospheric and solar wind-magnetosphere interaction physics. Key words. Magnetospheric physics (magnetopause, cusp and boundary layers; magnetopheric configuration and dynamics; solar wind-magnetosphere interactions)",

The flow burst was associated with a clear dipolarization ahead of the high\u2010speed part of the predominantly Earthward directed flow. Based on the analysis of the four spacecraft data, we found that a \u223c2000 km thick dipolarization front moves Earthward and dawnward with a speed of \u223c77 km\/s. The plasma before this front is deflected, consistent with the plasma ahead of a localized plasma bubble centered at midnight side being pushed aside by the moving obstacle. The main body of the high\u2010speed flow is directed mainly parallel to the dipolarization front. These observations indicate that the evolution of the dipolarization front across the tail is directly coupled with the fast flow.",

These structures include large\u2010amplitude ion cyclotron waves in the upward current region, and intense, spiky electric fields in the downward current region.

If we take the average or median of the spatial gradients and assume that the flow channel has a linear gradient, these values suggest that the full width of the flow channel is 2\u20133 RE in the \u201cdawn\u2010dusk\u201d direction and 1.5\u20132 RE in the north\u2010south direction. The velocity gradient at the duskward edge of a flow tends to be sharper than that at the dawnward edge, possibly reflecting an asymmetry in the magnetosphere\u2010ionosphere coupling process associated with the flow.",

The bounce\u2010averaged distribution function is defined for variables that are accessible to direct measurement, and some useful formulas for calculating the total energy and number density of the ring current are derived. The bounce\u2010averaged kinetic equation is solved, including losses due to charge exchange with neutral hydrogen and Coulomb collisions with thermal plasma along ion drift paths. Time\u2010dependent magnetospheric electric fields and anisotropic initial pitch angle distributions are considered. The generation of ion precipitating fluxes is addressed, a process that is still not completely understood. It is shown that both the decrease of the distribution function due to \u2026",

            "Magnetic reconnection is a process that converts magnetic energy into bi-directional plasma jets; it is believed to be the dominant process by which solar-wind energy enters the Earth's magnetosphere 1, 2. This energy is subsequently dissipated by magnetic storms and aurorae 3, 4. Previous single-spacecraft observations 5, 6, 7 revealed only single jets at the magnetopause\u2014while the existence of a counter-streaming jet was implicitly assumed, no experimental confirmation was available. Here we report in situ two-spacecraft observations of bi-directional jets at the magnetopause, finding evidence for a stable and extended reconnection line; the latter implies substantial entry of the solar wind into the magnetosphere. We conclude that reconnection is determined by large-scale interactions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere, rather than by local conditions at the magnetopause.",
