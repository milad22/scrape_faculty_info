A novel apparatus to measure the effective thermal conductivity of rigid foam at temperatures ranging from 20 K to 300 K was developed and used to study three samples of NCFI 24-124 foam insulation. In preparation for measurement, the foam samples were either treated with a uniquely designed moisture absorption apparatus or different residual gases to study their impact on the effective thermal conductivity of the foam. The resulting data are compared to other measurements and mathematical models reported in the literature.",

The instrument consists of two concentric copper cylinders with the annular space filled with the insulating material. The outer cylinder is thermally anchored to the coldhead of a single stage Gifford\u2010McMahon cryocooler, while the inner copper cylinder is used for generating uniform heat flux through the insulating material. The temperature of both cylinders is measured at several locations to ensure uniform boundary conditions. The entire apparatus is wrapped in multi\u2010layer insulation and suspended in a vacuum cryostat that provides an insulating environment.

The measuring device consists of two closed, concentric cylinders suspended inside of a vacuum insulated cryostat. The insulation being tested occupies the annular space between the cylinders. A single stage Gifford-McMahon cryocooler, thermally anchored to the outer cylinder, cools the apparatus to a desired temperature range. A heater mounted on the inner cylinder generates uniform heat flux through the insulating material between the two cylinders. During each measurement, a temperature difference of roughly 10 K across the insulation is maintained.

The foam tested in the present study is NCFI 24-124, a polyisocyanurate foam used on the External Tanks of the Space Shuttle. The foam was tested first in ambient pressure air, then evacuated and tested once more. These thermal conductivities were compared to the thermal conductivity taken from a sample immediately after being subjected to conditions similar to those experienced by the foam while on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. To mimic the conditions experienced on the launch pad, an apparatus was built to enclose one side of the foam sample in a warm, humid environment while the other side of the sample contacts a stainless steel surface held at 77 K.

One of these pertains to Spray On Foam Insulation (SOFI) NCFI 24124, a thermal insulation material used on the liquid hydrogen and oxygen tanks of the Space Shuttle at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). However, several problems including infinitesimal amounts of water and inevitable water binding to the foam makes the MR signal weak especially for high resolution MRI. The 900 MHz ultra wide bore (UWB) NMR spectrometer at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) provides a unique opportunity to perform this evaluation due to its high MRI sensitivity at 21.1 T and its ability to examine large volume samples. The recent upgrade of the UWB900 MHz MRI scanner (August, 2010), allows for ultra-short echo time (UTE) 3D MRI performance. The \u2026",

            "A device to measure bulk effective thermal conductivity of powder insulation at cryogenic temperatures has been designed and tested. The design consists of two concentric cylinders which are suspended inside of a cryostat. The insulation being tested is filled into the annular space between the cylinders. In the first test method the insulation space is evacuated, and the cryostat is filled with LN2 until the outer cylinder is completely submerged. The ensuing temperature drop of the inner cylinder over time is recorded. The rate of temperature decrease is used to calculate the bulk effective thermal conductivity of the insulation. For the second test method, a Gifford-McMahon single stage cryocooler is used to cool the apparatus to a desired temperature range. The insulation is evacuated, and a heater mounted on the inside cylinder creates a temperature difference between the two cylinders. Fourier's law of heat conduction is used to relate that temperature difference to a bulk effective thermal conductivity of the powder insulation. The insulation specimen used for this experiment was aerogel bead insulation. The first test method covered an average temperature range of 85-130 Kelvin. The calculated bulk effective thermal conductivity from the first method for this range increases from 0.333 to 0.714 mW\/m* K. Six data points have been produced by the second test method. The average temperature for the second method ranged from 30-80 Kelvin. Over this temperature range the thermal conductivity shows an increase from 0.142 to 0.377 mW\/m* K.

            "There is a continuing need for improved rigid foam insulation, particularly for cryogenic storage aboard aerospace vehicles. The present work is a material characterization of spray-on foam insulation used on the Space Shuttle External Tank. The characterization includes imaging and measurements of thermal conductivity, ultimate tensile strength, and moisture absorption. Thermal conductivity measurements are the main focus of the present work, as it is the most relevant property to insulation performance. A novel apparatus was developed to measure the thermal conductivity of rigid foam at temperatures ranging from 20 K to 300 K with a\u2206 T of 10 K between the sides of the foam sample. The effective thermal conductivity of three samples of NCFI 24-124 foam insulation was measured over the full temperature range. Additionally, the effects of different residual gases and moisture absorption on the thermal conductivity of the foam were studied. The data were compared to data from the literature and to mathematical models developed to predict the thermal conductivity. The data show that gas condensation can play a significant role in the thermal conductivity of the foam at low temperature. Moisture absorption can occur in the foam in application when cryogenic fuel is filled into a tank which sits in a warm, humid environment. An apparatus was developed to subject foam samples to these conditions. The moisture content in the samples was then measured. The samples were then imaged using the 900 MHz NMR magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory to determine the location of the water within the foam. Samples conditioned for \u2026",
