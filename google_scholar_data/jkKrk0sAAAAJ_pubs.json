The three major components of the detector, the tracking, calorimeter and muon detectors, will be described in a forthcoming article. The present paper describes the detector that was used from 1992 to the end of 1994. After this a major upgrade of some components was undertaken. Some performance figures from luminosity runs at HERA during 1993 and 1994 are given.",

To reconstruct ETmiss, fully calibrated electrons, muons, photons, hadronically decaying \u03c4-leptons, and jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and charged-particle tracks are used. These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various ETmiss contributions.

A narrow baryon state with strangeness S=+ 1 and mass M= 1555\u00b110 M e V\/c 2 was observed in the n K+ invariant mass spectrum. The peak\u2019s width is consistent with the CLAS resolution (F W H M= 26 M e V\/c 2), and its statistical significance is (7.8\u00b11.0) \u03c3. A baryon with positive strangeness has exotic structure and cannot be described in the framework of the naive constituent quark model. The mass of the observed state is consistent with the mass predicted by the chiral soliton model for the \u0398+ baryon. In addition, the p K+ invariant mass distribution was analyzed in the reaction \u03b3 p\u2192 K\u2212 K+ p with high statistics in search of doubly charged exotic baryon states.
