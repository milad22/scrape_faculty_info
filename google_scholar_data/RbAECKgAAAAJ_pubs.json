This source has the advantages of high coherence, simplicity for tuning, simple alignment, and stable output. The peak output power for the terahertz radiation reaches 69.4 W at a wavelength of 196 \u00b5m (1.53 THz), which corresponds to a photon conversion efficiency of 3.3%. A simple optimization of the design can yield a compact terahertz source.",

Linear and quadratic temperature coefficients of the refractive index have been fitted to data measured between room temperature and 95\u200a\u00b0C. In the midinfrared, the refractive index and temperature dependence are obtained from analysis of etalon fringes measured by Fourier-transform spectroscopy in undoped GaAs wafers. In the near infrared, the refractive index is deduced from the quasiphasematching (QPM) wavelengths of second-harmonic generation in orientation-patterned GaAs crystals. Two alternative empirical expressions are fitted to the data to give the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature. These dispersion relations agree with observed QPM conditions for midinfrared difference-frequency generation and second \u2026",

            "Quasi-phase-matched (QPM) GaAs structures, 0.5 mm thick, 10 mm long, and with 61\u2010\u00b5m grating periods, were grown by a combination of molecular-beam epitaxy and hydride vapor phase epitaxy. These were characterized by use of mid-IR second-harmonic generation (SHG) with a ZnGeP_2 (ZGP) optical parametric oscillator as a pump source. The SHG efficiencies of QPM GaAs and QPM LiNbO_3 were directly compared, and a ratio of nonlinear coefficients d_14GaAs\/d_33LiNbO_3=5.01\u00b10.3 was found at 4.1\u2010\u00b5m fundamental wavelength. For input pulse energies as low as 50 \u00b5J and \u224860\u2010ns pulse duration, an internal SHG conversion efficiency of 33% was measured in QPM GaAs.",
