            "The magnetic field dependence of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N (E F, H), is determined in single-crystal Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 by specific heat measurements. The total specific heat is best described by including two predictions for the electronic specific heat of d-wave superconductivity: a T 2 term in zero field and an increased linear term in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Cu O 2 planes. The additional linear term, which implies a finite N (E F, H), obeys N (E F, H)\u221d(H H c 2) 1 2 as predicted by Volovik for superconductivity with lines of nodes in the gap.",

            "Axonal chemotaxis is believed to be important in wiring up the developing and regenerating nervous system, but little is known about how axons actually respond to molecular gradients. We report a new quantitative assay that allows the long-term response of axons to gradients of known and controllable shape to be examined in a three-dimensional gel. Using this assay, we show that axons may be nature's most-sensitive gradient detectors, but this sensitivity exists only within a narrow range of ligand concentrations. This assay should also be applicable to other biological processes that are controlled by molecular gradients, such as cell migration and morphogenesis.",
