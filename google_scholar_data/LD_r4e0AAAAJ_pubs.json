            "We describe the design of a new polarization sensitive receiver, spt-3g, for the 10-meter South Pole Telescope (spt). The spt-3g receiver will deliver a factor of ~20 improvement in mapping speed over the current receiver, spt-pol. The sensitivity of the spt-3g receiver will enable the advance from statistical detection of B-mode polarization anisotropy power to high signal-to-noise measurements of the individual modes, i.e., maps. This will lead to precise (~0.06 eV) constraints on the sum of neutrino masses with the potential to directly address the neutrino mass hierarchy. It will allow a separation of the lensing and inflationary B-mode power spectra, improving constraints on the amplitude and shape of the primordial signal, either through spt-3g data alone or in combination with bicep2\/keck, which is observing the same area of sky. The measurement of small-scale temperature anisotropy will provide new constraints \u2026",

These detectors can be sensitive across a broader bandwidth compared to waveguide-coupled detectors.

            "The valley-orbit coupling in a few-electron Si quantum dot is expected to be a function of its occupation number N. We study the spectrum of multivalley Si quantum dots for 2\u2264 N\u2264 4, showing that, counterintuitively, electron-electron interaction effects on the valley-orbit coupling are negligible. For N= 2 they are suppressed by valley interference, for N= 3 they vanish due to spinor overlaps, and for N= 4 they cancel between different pairs of electrons. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we examine the experimental energy spectrum of a few-electron metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot. The measured spin-valley state filling sequence in a magnetic field reveals that the valley-orbit coupling is definitively unaffected by the occupation number.",
