            "Magnetic fluid dynamic behaviors during resistance spot welding have important influences on weld nugget formation. In this paper, a coupled multiphysics finite element model, which realizes the coupling of mass conservation, momentum conservation, energy conservation, and the Maxwell system of equations, is proposed to systematically investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer behaviors in a spot weld nugget. It is found that the flow field in the spot weld nugget evolves through five consecutive stages: incubation, fluctuation, rapid growth, rapid attenuation, and termination. Molten metal in the nugget makes regular rotational flow in four symmetrical loops, which changes the temperature gradient in weld nugget during heating and holding, and also yields significant effects on the shape and thickness of weld nugget.",

            "Implementation of lightweight low-ductility materials such as aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys and composite materials has become urgently needed for automotive manufacturers to improve the competitiveness of their products. However, hybrid use of these materials poses big challenges to traditional joining process. Self-piercing riveting (SPR) is currently the most popular technique for joining dissimilar materials and has been widely used in joining all-aluminum and multimaterial vehicle bodies. However, in riveting magnesium alloys, cracks always occur for its low ductility. In this paper, a hybrid joining process named friction self-piercing riveting (F-SPR), which combines mechanical joining mechanism of SPR with solid-state joining mechanism of friction stir spot welding (FSSW) by making rivet rotating at high speed in riveting process, was proposed aiming at joining the low-ductility materials.

Due to the formation of hard and brittle intermetallic compounds in fusion welded or brazed aluminum and steel welds, resistance spot welding is hardly used. Self-piercing riveting is a preferred cold forming fastening technology and has been widely used in joining aluminum sheets and aluminum to steel sheets of multi-material vehicle bodies. However, the vast variety of stack-ups with different gauges and material properties in a body-in-white brings problems to the selection of rivets and dies. How to make the most of the rivetable range of a specific rivet and die combination is essential for not only the simplification of production line layout but also cost reduction.

It has long been hypothesized that the rapid blood vessel remodeling occurring after fistula creation is, in part, a process to restore the mechanical stresses to some preferred level, ie, mechanical homeostasis. We present computational hemodynamic simulations in four patient-specific models of mature arteriovenous fistulae reconstructed from 3D ultrasound scans. Our results suggest that these mature fistulae have remodeled to return to \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019shear stresses away from the anastomoses: about 1.0 Pa in the outflow veins and about 2.5 Pa in the inflow arteries.

This experimental study investigates the effects of several variables on shunting, including material, surface condition, welding schedule, and other process parameters. The experimental results show that weld spacing and surface condition have the largest effects on shunting. The electrode force in general helps avoid shunting, with the exception that for a narrow weld spacing it actually promotes shunting by reducing the electrical resistance in the shunting path. It was found that shunted welds may have larger\/darker indentation marks than the shunt welds, although they are smaller in weld size. In general, it was found that the variables are tightly coupled and their interaction is complex, making it difficult to single out the influence of individual factors in shunting.",

            "Truncated electrodes with different cone angle are widely used in vehicle body assembly. However, the effect of the cone angle on welding process still keeps unclear. In this paper, a multi-physics finite element model, which considered the coupling of electric field, magnetic field, fluid flow and heat transfer, was used to study the effect of the cone angle variation on resistance spot welding. Four kinds of cone angles, including 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0, were studied systematically. Research results showed that the cone angle variation affects not only weld quality but also electrode life. Specifically, the lower cone angle, the more severe current density singularity at the tip edge, the stronger electromagnetic stirring in the molten nugget, and thus the stronger fluid flow and more uniform temperature field in the weld nugget, which would produce a positive effect on the weld quality. At the same time, the low cone angles \u2026",

            "Electromagnetic stirring (EMS) has been demonstrated to have significant effect on molten metal in terms of crystal orientation, grain refinement and macro appearance of solidified structures by making use of Lorentz force. In the present study, resistance spot welding (RSW) process of 1.25 mm thick dual-phase steel DP780 with and without the external magnetic field applied has been experimentally investigated. Impacts of the EMS method on nugget appearance, quasi-static performance, fatigue life, and fracture morphology have been systematically discussed. Results of the metallographic tests showed that, compared with the traditional resistance spot weld (RSW weld), the weld under the EMS effect (EMS-RSW weld) was wider and thinner with an obvious increase in nugget diameter. Besides, within the EMS-RSW weld, crystal orientation along the faying surface of workpieces was less directional and the \u2026",
