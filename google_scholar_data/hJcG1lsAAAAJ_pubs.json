            "A sharp rise from 4000 to 3650 A in the excess flux was obtained when a power-law determined in the red and infrared was subtracted from IR-optical-UV composite spectra of eight Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars to measure UV excess. The excess is produced by Balmer continuum emission which, relative to H-alpha, is greater than the prediction of Case B recombination by a factor of 1.5-2.5. An additional component from 5000 A to the far-UV was found when the spectra were fitted with combinations of power-law and hydrogen recombination continua. The component is well described by a blackbody at a single temperature ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 K. All of the observed spectra were producible with combinations of power-law, recombination and blackbody emission, and all of the objects in the sample were found to have a power-law component with a slope of-1.1+ or-0.1.",

Most of this fine structure cannot be detected in ground-based images. We have assigned qualitative classifications for these morphological features and a Hubble type for the inner region of each galaxy, and we have also measured quantitative information such as 0 farcs 18 and 0 farcs 92 aperture magnitudes, position angles, and ellipticities, where possible. There is little direct evidence for unusually high rates of interaction in the Seyfert galaxies. Slightly less than 10% of all the galaxies show tidal features or multiple nuclei.

The ratio of maximum to minimum \ufb02ux was 24.5 for the continuum at 1350 A, and the continuum was signi\ufb01cantly bluer when it was brighter. The high-ionization emission lines showed the strong-est variations, with N v\/11240 and He 11\/11640 exhibiting maximum-to-minimum \ufb02ux ratios as high as those of the continuum.

Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of nine new AGNs imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow us to create\" AGN-free\" images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the H\u03b2 time lag, which is assumed to yield the average H\u03b2 BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity.

After accounting for other sources of radiation, the continua are fitted with spectra predicted for optically thick steady-state accretion disks which include the effects of general relativity. The two fitting parameters, the mass of the accreting black hole and the accretion rate, are determined by the data with a formal accuracy of 20 percent. The masses range from 0.2-0.5 billion solar mass for 3C 273 and PKS 0405-123 to 1-3 billion solar masses for the high-redshift quasars. The values depend on the assumed disk inclination and the angular momentum of the hole. The high luminosities of these six quasars are all within a factor of 2 of their Eddington limits, and this conclusion is not extremely sensitive to the modeling assumptions.",

Completeness is verified to 0.30~ Jy, below which we have quantified the incompleteness down to 0.22~ Jy for our statistical analysis.\u00b6 The Seyfert subsample is the largest unbiased sample of (118) Seyfert galaxies ever assembled and is complete not only to 0.30~ Jy at 12um, but also with respect to a bolometric flux limit of ~(cgs). The average  for the full sample, corrected for incompleteness at low fluxes, is , while that for Seyferts is , suggesting that several Seyferts are yet to be identified in our sample. The AGN luminosity functions (LFs) are more complete than those of the optically selected CfA Seyfert galaxies for all luminosities and AGN types.\u00b6 The 60um LF for a complete 60um--flux--limited (at 8.3~ Jy) subsample of 235 galaxies is in satisfactory agreement with those derived from the bright galaxy sample (BGS) and the deep high--galactic latitude sample, both selected at 60um. Over the high lum. range where our sample and the BGS overlap, however, our space densities are systematically lower by a factor of , whereas at low lum. our space densities are higher by about the same amount. Comparable results are obtained when comparing the far--IR LF of our entire sample with the one derived from the BGS. This is not unexpected, because of the bias towards high-luminosity spirals caused by selection at 60um.",
