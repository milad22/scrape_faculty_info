The calculations are performed on hydrogen-passivated spherical Si clusters with diameters up to 27.2 \u212b (\u223c 800 Si and H atoms). It is shown that (i) the self-energy correction in quantum dots is enhanced substantially compared to bulk, and is not size independent as implicitly assumed in all semiempirical calculations, and (ii) quantum confinement and reduced electronic screening result in appreciable excitonic Coulomb energies. Calculated optical gaps are in very good agreement with absorption data.",

In this paper we implement a linear-response theory within the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) and apply this technique to calculate excitation energies and optical absorption spectra for a variety of systems ranging from single atoms to semiconductor quantum dots up to several hundred atoms in size. The TDLDA formalism represents a fully ab initio formalism for excited states that avoids many of the drawbacks associated with empirical or semiempirical methods. Compared to other ab initio techniques for excited states, the TDLDA method requires considerably less computational effort and can be applied to much larger systems \u2026",

The analyses of the optical absorption spectra calculated within the time-dependent local density approximation indicate that the d electrons in Au n clusters are significantly more involved in low-energy transitions and give rise to more quenched oscillator strengths (by screening the s electrons) than in Ag n clusters.

            "The structural energetics and diffusion mechanisms of the two most important point defects in rutile Ti O 2, the oxygen vacancy (V O) and the titanium interstitial (Ti I), are examined using the ab initio pseudopotential total-energy method. The two defects are found to be somewhat competitive in energy, with V O being more favorable in a larger range of the stoichiometry. The Ti I, on the other hand, is shown to be the major diffusive species, since its low migration barrier is significantly smaller (by\u223c 1 eV) compared to that of V O. The diffusion mechanisms of Ti I parallel and perpendicular to the crystal c axis are found to be different with a surprisingly larger barrier along the more open [001] direction, which was originally thought to be the easier channel for Ti self-diffusion. These theoretical findings are in excellent quantitative agreement with existing experimental data.",

Efficient cooling of species in the source has allowed us to resolve multiple features in the PES for all sizes studied. Spectra for an extensive set of low-energy Si n\u2212 isomers found by a global search have been simulated using density functional theory and pseudopotentials. Except for n= 12, calculations for Si n\u2212 ground states agree with the measurements. This does not hold for other plausible geometries. Hence PES data validate the tricapped trigonal prism morphologies for medium-sized Si clusters.",
