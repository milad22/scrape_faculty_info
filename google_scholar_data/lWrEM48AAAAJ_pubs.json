            "Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO3, is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric \u2026",

The benzene quasiparticle energy gap is predicted to be 7.2 eV on graphite, substantially reduced from its calculated gas-phase value of 10.5 eV. This decrease is caused by a change in electronic correlation energy, an effect completely absent from the corresponding Kohn-Sham gap. For weakly coupled molecules, this correlation energy change can be described as a surface polarization effect.

            "Structural and electronic properties of CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 are calculated using density-functional theory within the local spin-density approximation. After an analysis of structural stability, zone-center optical phonon frequencies are evaluated using the frozen-phonon method and mode effective charges are determined from computed Berry-phase polarizations. Excellent agreement between calculated and measured phonon frequencies is obtained. The calculated mode effective charges are in poorer agreement with experiment, although they are of the correct order of magnitude and the lattice contribution to the static dielectric constant is calculated to be\u223c 40. On the basis of these results, various mechanisms are considered for the enormous dielectric response reported in recent experiments. No direct evidence is found for intrinsic lattice or electronic mechanisms, suggesting that increased attention should be \u2026",
