            "The vibrational frequency of the amide I transition of peptides is known to be sensitive to the strength of its hydrogen bonding interactions. In an effort to account for interactions with hydrogen bonding solvents in terms of electrostatics, we study the vibrational dynamics of the amide I coordinate of N-methylacetamide in prototypical polar solvents:\u2009 D2O, CDCl3, and DMSO-d6. These three solvents have varying hydrogen bonding strengths, and provide three distinct solvent environments for the amide group. The frequency\u2212frequency correlation function, the orientational correlation function, and the vibrational relaxation rate of the amide I vibration in each solvent are retrieved by using three-pulse vibrational photon echoes, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, and pump\u2212probe spectroscopy. Direct comparisons are made to molecular dynamics simulations. We find good quantitative agreement between the \u2026",

Application of such sources to the study of atomic-scale motion requires efficient modulation of these beams on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to femtoseconds. However, ultrafast X-ray modulators are not generally available. Here we report efficient subnanosecond coherent switching of synchrotron beams by using acoustic pulses in a crystal to modulate the anomalous low-loss transmission of X-ray pulses. The acoustic excitation transfers energy between two X-ray beams in a time shorter than the synchrotron pulse width of about 100 ps. Gigahertz modulation of the diffracted X-rays is also observed. We report different geometric arrangements, such as a switch based on the collision of two counter-propagating acoustic pulses: this doubles the X-ray modulation frequency, and also provides a means of observing a localized transient \u2026",

In particular, the marriage of synchrotron radiation and ultrafast laser technology is opening up a new frontier of materials research. Structural changes initiated by femtosecond laser pulses can be tracked in real time using time-resolved X-ray diffraction on picosecond time scales or shorter. Here, research at the Advanced Photon Source is described, illustrating the opportunities for ultrafast diffraction with some recent work on the generation of impulsive strain, coherent phonon generation and supersonic diffusion of electron\u2013hole plasmas. The flexibility of time-resolved Bragg and Laue diffraction geometries are both utilized to illuminate the strain generation and evolution process. Time-resolved X-ray science will become increasingly important \u2026",
