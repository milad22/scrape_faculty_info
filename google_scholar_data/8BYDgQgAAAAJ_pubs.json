            "The field of thermoelectrics has grown dramatically in recent years. In particular new and novel materials research has been undertaken and device applications have increased. In spite of this resurgence of interest there are very few books available that outline the basic concepts in this field. Thus it is necessary that a book be written that encompasses the basic theory and introduces some of the resent research into improved materials for solid-state cooling and power generation. Therefore the aim of this book is threefold. First, to present the basic theory of thermoelectricity. Both theoretical concepts and experimental aspects of the field of solid-state cooling and power generation are discussed. Second, to bridge the gap between theory and application. To this end, the techniques for producing good thermoelectric materials and module design issues are reviewed. Third, to present some of the research into new and novel materials that has drawn the attention of the scientific community. The book is intended as a reference to experimentalists working in the field; however, it will also prove useful to scientists corning into the field from other areas of research. It can also serve as a useful text for graduate students.",

            "Recently there has been a resurgence of research efforts related to the investigation of new and novel materials for small-scale thermoelectric refrigeration and power generation applications. These materials need to couple and optimize a variety of properties in order to exhibit the necessary figure of merit, i.e. the numerical expression that is commonly used to compare one potential thermoelectric material with another. The figure of merit is related to the coefficient of performance or efficiency of a particular device made from a material. The best thermoelectric material should possess thermal properties similar to that of a glass and electrical properties similar to that of a perfect single-crystal material, i.e. a poor thermal conductor and a good electrical conductor. Skutterudites are materials that appear to have the potential to fulfill such criteria. These materials exhibit many types of interesting properties \u2026",

It is observed that a relatively small concentration of La in the voids results in a relatively large decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, the largest decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity, compared to \u201cunfilled\u201d CoSb 3 is not observed near 100% filling of the voids with La, as was previously believed. This suggests a point-defect-type phonon scattering effect due to the partial, random distribution of La in the voids as well as the \u201crattling\u201d effect of the La ions, resulting in the scattering of a larger spectrum of phonons than in the case of 100% filling. An additional benefit of partial filling in thermoelectric materials is that it may be one way of adjusting the electronic \u2026",

            "Good thermoelectric materials possess low thermal conductivity while maximizing electric carrier transport. This article looks at various classes of materials to understand their behavior and determine methods to modify or \u201ctune\u201d them to optimize their thermoelectric properties. Whether it is the use of \u201crattlers\u201d in cage structures such as skutterudites, or mixed-lattice atoms such as the complex half-Heusler alloys, the ability to manipulate the thermal conductivity of a material is essential in optimizing its properties for thermoelectric applications.",

            "Resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and Hall measurements were performed on densified nanocrystalline composite materials of undoped and Ag-doped PbTe nanocrystals to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for Seebeck coefficient enhancement in nanocrystalline systems. The unique temperature dependence of the resistivity and mobility for these PbTe nanocomposites suggests that grain-boundary potential barrier scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism. We propose that carrier trapping in the grain boundaries forms energy barriers that impede the conduction of carriers between grains, essentially filtering charge carriers with energy less than the barrier height. These nanocomposites therefore demonstrate an enhanced Seebeck coefficient as compared to single crystal or polycrystalline PbTe at similar carrier concentrations.",

            "Structural analysis and thermal conductivity data on Sr 8 Ga 16 Ge 30 and Eu 8 Ga 16 Ge 30 crystals are reported. These compounds form in the cubic space group Pm 3 n with lattice parameters of 10.721 (2) and 10.703 (2) \u00c5 respectively. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction and structural refinement indicate that the randomly distributed Ga and Ge atoms form a tetrahedrally bonded three-dimensional net in whose cavities the \u201cguest\u201d Sr or Eu atoms reside. The \u201cguest\u201d atoms in the smaller of these polyhedra (dodecahedra) have spherical thermal ellipsoids while those in the larger polyhedra (tetrakaidecahedra) display relatively large and highly anisotropic thermal ellipsoids. The low-thermal conductivity of these compounds at low temperatures is attributable to the disorder introduced by the dynamic \u201crattling\u201d introduced by these \u201cguest\u201d atoms inside the polyhedra.
