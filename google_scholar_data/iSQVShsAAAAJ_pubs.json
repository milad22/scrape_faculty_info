The transverse and longitudinal modes of these nanostructures are resolved, and the size variation of the plasmon peaks is studied. The effect of electromagnetic coupling between closely spaced nanoparticles is also observed. Finally, the relation between energy-loss measurements and optical spectroscopy of nanoparticle plasmon modes is discussed.",

            "A simple imaging system, together with complex semidefinite programming, is used to generate the transmission matrix (TM) of a multimode fiber. Once the TM is acquired, we can modulate the phase of the input signal to induce strong mode interference at the fiber output. The optical design does not contain a reference arm, no internal reference signal is used, and no interferometric measurements are required. We use a phase-only spatial light modulator to shape the profile of the propagating modes, and the output intensity patterns are collected. The semidefinite program uses a convex optimization algorithm to generate the TM of the optical system using intensity only measurements. This simple, yet powerful, method can be used to compensate for modal dispersion in multimode fiber communication systems. It also yields great promise for the next generation biomedical imaging, quantum communication, and \u2026",

In a simple optical setup, a spatial light modulator is used to generate a random sequence of phase-modulated wavefronts, and the resulting intensity speckle patterns in the transmitted light are acquired on a camera. The SDP algorithm allows computation of the complex transmission matrix of the system from this sequence of intensity-only measurements, without need for a reference beam. Once the transmission matrix is determined, optimal wavefronts are computed that focus the incident beam to any position or sequence of positions on the far side of the scattering medium, without the need for any subsequent measurements or wavefront shaping iterations.
