            "As the experimental andtheoretical investigations of the structure and energetics of isolated molecules are entering a mature stage of development, the interactions between molecules are becoming the next frontier of molecular science. Such interactions, although weak comparedto the forces bonding mol-ecules internally, are responsible for an extensive range of physical, chemical, and biological phenom-ena: from bulk properties of rare gases to the signal induction in neurotransmitters. There are too many fields where intermolecular potentials are needed to list them here. A few important examples are Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems, 1 drug design, 2 studies of processes in the earth\u2019s atmosphere, 3 and interstellar chemistry. 4 Investigations of intermolecular forces not only en-large our knowledge of nature but may lead to significant technological advances.

Lett. 91, 33201 (2003)] for an accurate calculation of the dispersion energy utilizing frequency-dependent density susceptibilities of monomers obtained from time-dependent density-functional theory (DFT). In the present paper, we report numerical calculations for the helium, neon, water, and carbon dioxide dimers and show that for a wide range of intermonomer separations, including the van der Waals and short-range repulsion regions, the method provides dispersion energies with accuracies comparable to those that can be achieved using the current most sophisticated wave-function methods.

An accurate analytic fit to the ab initio results has been developed and low-energy stationary points on the potential energy surface have been found. We have determined that there are three minima on the surface. Two of them, the tilted T-shape and the parallel-displaced, are nearly isoenergetic with interaction energies of \u22122.77 and \u22122.74 kcal\/mol, respectively. The third minimum, a twisted edge-to-edge conformation, is significantly less attractive, with the interaction energy equal to \u22121.82 kcal\/mol.

            "The sixth blind test of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods has been held, with five target systems: a small nearly rigid molecule, a polymorphic former drug candidate, a chloride salt hydrate, a co-crystal and a bulky flexible molecule. This blind test has seen substantial growth in the number of participants, with the broad range of prediction methods giving a unique insight into the state of the art in the field. Significant progress has been seen in treating flexible molecules, usage of hierarchical approaches to ranking structures, the application of density-functional approximations, and the establishment of new workflows and `best practices' for performing CSP calculations. All of the targets, apart from a single potentially disordered Z\u2032 = 2 polymorph of the drug candidate, were predicted by at least one submission. Despite many remaining challenges, it is clear that CSP methods are becoming more \u2026",

            "The Born\u2013Oppenheimer potential energy curve for the electronic ground state of the hydrogen molecule has been computed for internuclear distances 0.2\u2264R\u226412.0 bohr. At all R the energies are lower than any previously reported values. At the equilibrium distance the improvement is negligible; its largest value, 0.47 cm\u22121, has been obtained for R=2.4 bohr. Vibrational energies have been computed for all isotopic species using the new potential energy curve. For H2, HD, and D2 the recent nonadiabatic corrections of Wolniewicz have been included. The resulting dissociation energies of H2 and HD agree with the experimental values within the experimental error limits; for D2 the discrepancy amounts to 0.6\u00b10.3 cm\u22121.",
