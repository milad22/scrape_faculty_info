            "The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell\u2010released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (\u201cMISEV\u201d) guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these \u201cMISEV2014\u201d guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years.

The DNA: liposome ratio, and mild sonication, heating, and extrusion steps used for liposome preparation were crucial for improved systemic delivery. Size fractionation studies showed that maximal gene expression was produced by a homogeneous population of DNA: liposome complexes between 200 to 450 nm in size. Cryo-electron microscopy examination demonstrates that the DNA: liposome complexes have a novel morphology, and that the DNA is condensed on the interior of invaginated liposomes between two lipid bilayers. This structure could account for the high efficiency of gene delivery in vivo and for the broad tissue distribution of the DNA \u2026",

            "Nitric oxide (NO) has earned the reputation of being a signaling mediator with many diverse and often opposing biological activities. The diversity in response to this simple diatomic molecule comes from the enormous variety of chemical reactions and biological properties associated with it. In the past few years, the importance of steady-state NO concentrations has emerged as a key determinant of its biological function. Precise cellular responses are differentially regulated by specific NO concentration. We propose five basic distinct concentration levels of NO activity: cGMP-mediated processes ([NO] < 1\u201330 nM), Akt phosphorylation ([NO] = 30\u2013100 nM), stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 ([NO] = 100\u2013300 nM), phosphorylation of p53 ([NO] > 400 nM), and nitrosative stress (1 \u03bcM). In general, lower NO concentrations promote cell survival and proliferation, whereas higher levels favor cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence \u2026",

A major mechanism of regulating TGF-\u03b2 activity occurs through factors that control the processing of the latent to the biologically active form of the molecule. We have shown previously that thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), a platelet \u03b1-granule and extracellular matrix protein, activates latent TGF-\u03b2 via a protease- and cell-independent mechanism and have localized the TGF-\u03b2 binding\/activation region to the type 1 repeats of platelet TSP1.

Activation was further localized to the unique sequence RFK found between the first and the second type 1 repeats of TSP1 (amino acids 412-415) by the use of synthetic peptides.

Knobs appear on infected erythrocytes and are the points of attachment to endothelium 2. Sequestration may protect the parasite from splenic destruction 3 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria 4. Correlates of sequestration have been developed in vitro using cultured human endothelium 5 and an amelanotic melanoma cell line 6. Knobless strains (K\u2212) of P. falciparum fail to sequester in vivo and to bind to cells in vitro. We now present evidence that the receptor for cytoadherence is the glycoprotein, thrombospondin.

The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1, as defined by cornea pocket assays, was previously mapped to the amino-terminal portion of the protein within the procollagen region and the type 1 repeats.Methods and Results\u2014We evaluated the specificity and efficacy of different regions of TSP-1 using recombinant fragments of the protein on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation assays. In both assays, fragments containing the second and third type 1 repeats but not the procollagen region inhibited angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. To further define the sequences responsible for the angiostatic effect of TSP-1, we used synthetic peptides. The CAM assay defined 2 sequences that independently suppressed angiogenesis. The \u2026",

These TSP1 analogues induced programmed cell death in bovine aortic endothelial cells based on morphological changes, assessment of DNA fragmentation, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Intact TSP1 also induced DNA fragmentation. The endothelial cell response was specific because no DNA fragmentation was induced in MDA-MB-435S breast carcinoma cells, although TSP1 and the peptide conjugates inhibited the growth of both cell types.
