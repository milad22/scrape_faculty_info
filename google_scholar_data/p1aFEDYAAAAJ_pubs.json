Rectification is observed in the I - V curves and is quantitatively accounted for by an electric-field enhancement due to the finite radius-of-curvature of the probe-tip. The parallel wave-vector of certain states is obtained from the decay length of the tunneling current. A rich spectrum is obtained in the ratio of differential to total conductivity, yielding a direct measure of the Si surface density-of-states. Small shifts are observed in the spectrum as a function of doping, and are attributed to shifts in the position of the surface Fermi level.",

Techniques based on variable tip-sample separation are used to obtain high dynamic range (six orders of magnitude) in the measured current and conductance. Detailed spectra are obtained for all the materials, revealing the conduction-and valence-band edges, onset of the higher lying conduction band at the L point in the Brillouin zone, and various features associated with surface states.

First-principles total energy calculations reveal that a laterally contracted overlayer of Ga atoms bonded to a 1\u00d7 1 Ga adlayer is energetically favorable in the Ga-rich limit. The calculations also show that the energy of this surface structure is very insensitive to the lateral position of the contracted layer with respect to the underlying Ga layer. The flatness of the energy surface suggests the presence of rapidly moving domain boundaries separating regions of the surface having different registries. Such motion may lead to the 1\u00d7 1 corrugation pattern seen in scanning tunneling microscopy images.",

Not only do these two categories of reconstructions have completely different symmetries, but they also have different temperature dependence. It is thus demonstrated that surface reconstructions can be used to identify lattice polarity. Confirmation of the polarity assignment is provided by polarity-selective wet chemical etching of these surfaces.",
