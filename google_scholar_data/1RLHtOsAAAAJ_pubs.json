The recorded genera, viz., Alpinia, Pachira, Cupania, Holarrena, Derris and Sarcosperma in the present assemblage are new to the Tertiary flora of the Indian subcontinent. With the addition of presently recovered species, the megafloral assemblage of the Kathgodam area now comprises 67 species belonging mostly to angiospermous families. Most of the extant species resembling the fossil taxa are distributed in the tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests of north-east India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaya and adjoining areas, which suggest that warm humid climate with higher rainfall prevailed in the area during middle Miocene time. The analysis of present day distribution of modern comparable taxa of the fossils shows that about 90% of the taxa disappeared from the area and has migrated to other suitable regions where they have found favourble conditions for their survival. It indicates positive change in climate after middle Miocene. In relation to climate, the physiognomic characters of the leaf impressions have also been analysed.",

Grass short cell phytolith assemblages from modern grasses show significant variability with rising elevation.
