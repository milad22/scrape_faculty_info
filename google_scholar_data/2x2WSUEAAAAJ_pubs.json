            "The optical response of semiconducting monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is dominated by strongly bound excitons that are stable even at room temperature. However, substrate-related effects such as screening and disorder in currently available specimens mask many anticipated physical phenomena and limit device applications of TMDCs. Here, we demonstrate that that these undesirable effects are strongly suppressed in suspended devices. Extremely robust (photogain> 1,000) and fast (response time< 1 ms) photoresponse allow us to study, for the first time, the formation, binding energies and dissociation mechanisms of excitons in TMDCs through photocurrent spectroscopy. By analyzing the spectral positions of peaks in the photocurrent and by comparing them with first-principles calculations, we obtain binding energies, band gaps and spin-orbit splitting in monolayer TMDCs.

These conditions are satisfied by a universe of form (1) with K= 0 or-1 and filled with nor-mal matter. However, at S, p is positive by a finite amount. Therefore any perturbation of (1) which is not too large will leave p positive, and so there will still be a closed trapped surface and hence a physical singularity. Thus a universe that is similar on a large scale to the form (1) but has no exact local symmetries will have a singularity. Local irregularities cannot prevent it.The presence of matter gives a unique time-like congruence (the flow lines) which may be defined \u2026",

Here, a fast, general method to assemble multilayer films composed of one such photocatalytic protein complex, Photosystem I (PSI), onto a variety of substrates is reported. The resulting films, akin to the stacked thylakoid structures of leaves, consist of a protein matrix that is permeable to electrochemical mediators and contain a high concentration of photoelectrochemically active redox centers. These multilayer assemblies vastly outperform previously reported monolayer films of PSI in terms of photocurrent production when incorporated into an electrochemical system, and it is shown that these photocatalytic properties increase with the film thickness.

Emission functions have been obtained showing structure and energy thresholds which provide detailed information important in the understanding of this newly observed low-energy phenomenon. These data can be understood in terms of excited-state sputtering efficiencies and radiationless de-excitation processes which compete with radiative de-excitation of the excited states of the sputtered atoms.",

Wide variation is exhibited in the behavior of oscillation maxima as a function of scattering angle depending on the target species studied. A semiquantitative model is presented which treats the phenomenon in terms of quantum mechanical phase interference between pairs of near-resonant quasimolecular levels.",
