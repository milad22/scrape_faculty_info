            "Ferroelectric ferromagnets are exceedingly rare, fundamentally interesting multiferroic materials that could give rise to new technologies in which the low power and high speed of field-effect electronics are combined with the permanence and routability of voltage-controlled ferromagnetism 1, 2. Furthermore, the properties of the few compounds that simultaneously exhibit these phenomena 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are insignificant in comparison with those of useful ferroelectrics or ferromagnets: their spontaneous polarizations or magnetizations are smaller by a factor of 1,000 or more. The same holds for magnetic-or electric-field-induced multiferroics 6, 7, 8. Owing to the weak properties of single-phase multiferroics, composite and multilayer approaches involving strain-coupled piezoelectric and magnetostrictive components are the closest to application today 1, 2. Recently, however, a new route to ferroelectric ferromagnets \u2026",

Four-circle x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy show that the BiFeO3 thin films have rhombohedral symmetry although small monoclinic distortions have not been ruled out. Stripe ferroelectric domains oriented perpendicular to the substrate miscut direction and free of impurity phase are observed in BiFeO3 on high miscut (4\u00b0) (001) SrTiO3, which attributes to a relatively high value of remanent polarization (\u223c71\u03bcC\u2215cm2). Films grown on low miscut (0.8\u00b0) SrTiO3 have a small amount of impure phase \u03b1-Fe2O3 which contributes to lower the polarization values (\u223c63\u03bcC\u2215cm2). The BiFeO3 films grown on (101) and (111) SrTiO3 exhibited remanent polarizations of 86 and 98\u03bcC\u2215cm2, respectively.",

We find that the excess Fe at interstitial sites of the (Te, Se) layers not only suppresses superconductivity but also results in a weakly localized electronic state. We argue that these effects originate from the magnetic coupling between the excess Fe and the adjacent Fe square-planar sheets, which favors a short-range magnetic order.",

The most effective demagnetization is achieved by not only stepping the field strength down while the sample is rotating, but also by combining each field step with alternation in the field direction. By contrast, linearly decreasing the field strength or stepping the field down without alternating the field direction leaves the arrays with a larger remanent magnetic moment. These results suggest that nonmonotonic variations in field magnitude around and below the coercive field are important for the demagnetization process.",
