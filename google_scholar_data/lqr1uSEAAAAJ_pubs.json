            "The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment has measured a nonzero value for the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations. Antineutrinos from six 2.9 G W th reactors were detected in six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (flux-weighted baseline 470 m and 576 m) and one far (1648 m) underground experimental halls. With a 43 000 ton\u2013G W th\u2013day live-time exposure in 55 days, 10 416 (80 376) electron-antineutrino candidates were detected at the far hall (near halls). The ratio of the observed to expected number of antineutrinos at the far hall is R= 0.940\u00b10.011 (stat.)\u00b10.004 (syst.). A rate-only analysis finds sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.092\u00b10.016 (stat.)\u00b10.005 (syst.) in a three-neutrino framework.",

            "A high-statistics sample of charged-current muon neutrino scattering events collected with the MiniBooNE experiment is analyzed to extract the first measurement of the double differential cross section (d 2 \u03c3 d T \u03bc d cos\ufeff \u03b8 \u03bc) for charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) scattering on carbon. This result features minimal model dependence and provides the most complete information on this process to date. With the assumption of CCQE scattering, the absolute cross section as a function of neutrino energy (\u03c3 [E \u03bd]) and the single differential cross section (d \u03c3 d Q 2) are extracted to facilitate comparison with previous measurements. These quantities may be used to characterize an effective axial-vector form factor of the nucleon and to improve the modeling of low-energy neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. The results are relevant for experiments searching for neutrino oscillations.",
