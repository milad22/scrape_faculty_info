            "Chemical forces on surfaces have a central role in numerous scientific and technological fields, including catalysis 1, 2, thin film growth 3 and tribology 4, 5. Many applications require knowledge of the strength of these forces as a function of position in three dimensions, but until now such information has only been available from theory 2. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on atomic force microscopy that can obtain this data, and we use this approach to image the three-dimensional surface force field of graphite. We show force maps with picometre and piconewton resolution that allow a detailed characterization of the interaction between the surface and the tip of the microscope in three dimensions. In these maps, the positions of all atoms are identified, and differences between atoms at inequivalent sites are quantified. The results suggest that the excellent lubrication properties of graphite may be due to a \u2026",

A tuning-fork-based sensor provides flexibility in selecting probe tip materials, which can be either metallic or nonmetallic. When choosing a conducting tip and sample, simultaneous STM\/NC-AFM data acquisition is possible. Noticeable characteristics that distinguish this setup from similar systems providing simultaneous STM\/NC-AFM capabilities are its combination of relative compactness (on-top bath cryostat needs no pit), in situ exchange of tip and sample at low temperatures, short turnaround times, modest helium consumption, and unrestricted access from dedicated flanges. The latter permits not only the optical surveillance of the tip during approach but also the \u2026",

This article reviews recent progress in the development of a measurement mode called three\u2010dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D\u2010AFM) that allows the dense, three\u2010dimensional mapping of these surface fields with atomic resolution. Based on noncontact atomic force microscopy, 3D\u2010AFM is able to provide more detailed information on surface properties than ever before, thanks to the simultaneous multi\u2010channel acquisition of complementary spatial data such as local energy dissipation and tunneling currents. By illustrating the results of experiments performed on graphite and pentacene, we explain how 3D\u2010AFM data acquisition works, what challenges have to be addressed \u2026",

            "Despite its fundamental importance, physical mechanisms that govern friction are poorly understood. While a state of ultra-low friction, termed structural lubricity, is expected for any clean, atomically flat interface consisting of two different materials with incommensurate structures, some associated predictions could only be quantitatively confirmed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions so far. Here, we report structurally lubric sliding under ambient conditions at mesoscopic (\u223c 4,000\u2013130,000 nm 2) interfaces formed by gold islands on graphite. Ab initio calculations reveal that the gold\u2013graphite interface is expected to remain largely free from contaminant molecules, leading to structurally lubric sliding. The experiments reported here demonstrate the potential for practical lubrication schemes for micro-and nano-electromechanical systems, which would mainly rely on an atomic-scale structural mismatch between \u2026",

An overview of the physical fundamentals associated with each approach is presented, with particular emphasis on recent theoretical and experimental developments that constitute milestones in our scientific understanding.

Thus, scanning tunneling microscopy has been the principal tool for atomic scale catalysis research. In this Account, recent developments in NC-AFM will be presented that offer significant advantages for gaining a complete atomic level view of catalysis.The main advantage of NC-AFM is that the image contrast is due to the very short-range chemical forces that are of interest in catalysis.
