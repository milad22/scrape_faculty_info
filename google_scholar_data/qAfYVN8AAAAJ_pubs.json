            "Papers by Jensen and Meckling (1976), Jensen (1986), and Stulz (1988) suggest that a firm's leverage ratio and its level of inside ownership share common determinants. This paper examines whether inside equity and leverage are explained by a common set of variables that proxy for a firm's exposure to various market imperfections. These imperfections include the agency costs of equity, leverage-related costs, the tax advantage of debt, the costs of issuing securities, and the demand for risk-sharing by insiders. In contrast to Crutchley and Hansen (1989), but consistent with Jensen, Solberg, and Zorn (1992) and Holthausen and Larcker (1991), little evidence is found that leverage and inside equity are explained by the same variables. These results hold even after controlling for industry effects, an issue not examined by previous literature. In addition, leverage is related strongly and negatively to free cashflow, a \u2026",

Although we do not find that defensive ESOPs significantly reduce shareholder wealth on average, we identify two factors\u2014the change in managerial and employee ownership due to the ESOP and the simultaneous announcement of other defensive tactics\u2014that are associated with negative stock price reactions. We find that ESOPs are strong deterrents to takeover. ESOP targets that are acquired earn higher returns than targets without ESOPs, but the difference is not statistically significant.",

However, a poorly designed system could create incentives for excessive risk-taking by insurers, impose unnecessary costs on policyholders and financially sound insurers, and reduce market capacity.

            "This study provides evidence of the potential hedging effectiveness of insurance derivatives based on regional estimates of catastrophe losses. We estimate the percentage of insurers' by line and state underwriting risk that could have been eliminated over the 1974 through 1994 period if they had hedged using state-specific catastrophe derivatives based on Property Claims Service (PCS) reported losses. The results indicate that state-specific PCS catastrophe derivatives would have provided effective hedges for many insurers, especially those selling homeowners insurance. These findings suggest that basis risk is not likely to be a significant problem with state-specific catastrophe derivative contracts. We also compare the hedging effectiveness of state-specific catastrophe contracts to regional catastrophe contracts and to state-specific contracts based on by-line loss ratios.",

            "We provide estimates of the equity capital needed and the resulting tax costs incurred when supplying catastrophe insurance\/reinsurance using a partial equilibrium model that incorporates a specific loss distribution for US catastrophe losses. After consideration of insurer investment in tax-exempt securities, tax loss carry-back\/forward provisions, and personal taxes, our results imply that the tax costs of equity finance alone have a substantial effect on the cost of supplying catastrophe reinsurance. These results help explain a variety of industry developments that reduce tax costs. Also, when coupled with non-tax costs of capital, these results help explain the limited scope of catastrophe insurance\/reinsurance.",
