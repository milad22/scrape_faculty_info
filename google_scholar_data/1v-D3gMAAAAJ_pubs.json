We suggest that these dense cores are\" coherent\" in that the nonthermal, turbulent, contributions to the line width are so small that observed velocity dispersion is nearly independent of scale within the cores. In the second paper of this series (Goodman et al.), by analyzing maps of the cores' environments, we find an apparent transition to this coherent regime from a more turbulent one, at about the size scale of a FWHM NH 3 contour, or~ 0.1 pc.",

This Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) is observed in both codes and is triggered by Kolmogorov turbulence with Mach numbers less than~ 0.01. It is a common view that if a given constant density flow is stable, then stable vertical stratification should make the flow even more stable. Yet, we show that sufficient vertical stratification can be unstable to ZVI. ZVI is robust \u2026",

There is a group of four stars with P> 15 days that fall well above this relation, which, if real, would present a significant challenge to theories of stellar angular momentum evolution.

Self-gravity competes against the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI): gradients in dust content drive a vertical shear which risks overturning the dusty subdisk and forestalling GI. To understand the conditions under which the disk can resist the KHI, we perform three-dimensional simulations of stratified subdisks in the limit that dust particles are small and aerodynamically well coupled to gas, thereby screening out the streaming instability and isolating the KHI. Each subdisk is assumed to have a vertical density profile given by a spatially constant Richardson number Ri. We vary Ri and the midplane dust-to-gas ratio \u03bc 0 and find that the critical Richardson number dividing KH-unstable from KH-stable flows is not unique \u2026",

            "As dust settles in a protoplanetary disk, a vertical shear develops because the dust-rich gas in the midplane orbits at a rate closer to true Keplerian than the slower-moving dust-depleted gas above and below. A classical analysis (neglecting the Coriolis force and differential rotation) predicts that Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs when the Richardson number of the stratified shear flow is below roughly one-quarter. However, earlier numerical studies showed that the Coriolis force makes layers more unstable, whereas horizontal shear may stabilize the layers. Simulations with a three-dimensional spectral code were used to investigate these opposing influences on the instability in order to resolve whether such layers can ever reach the dense enough conditions for the onset of gravitational instability. I confirm that the Coriolis force, in the absence of radial shear, does indeed make dust layers more unstable \u2026",
