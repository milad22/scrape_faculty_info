This eliminates a sign problem that prevents utilization of the valence bond basis in Monte Carlo studies for nonbipartite lattices. Studying lattice sizes of up to 600 sites, we calculate singlet-singlet and spin-spin correlations and demonstrate how the lattice symmetry is restored within each topological sector as the system size is increased. Our findings are consistent with the expectation that the nearest-neighbor RVB states describe a topological spin liquid on these nonbipartite lattices.",

To do so, we utilize and generalize a method that was recently introduced and applied to the kagome lattice by one of the authors. This method relies on the choice of an appropriate cell for the respective lattice, for which a certain local linear independence property can be demonstrated. Whenever this is achieved, linear independence follows for arbitrarily large lattices that can be covered by such cells, for both open and periodic boundary conditions. We report that this method is applicable to the kagome, honeycomb, square, squagome, two types of pentagonal, square-octagonal, star, two types of Archimedean, three types of \u201cmartini\u201d, and fullerene-type lattices, eg, the well known \u2018buckyball.\u201d Applications of the linear independence property, such as the derivation of effective quantum dimer \u2026",

One such perturbation, the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, is an important perturbation for the S= 1\/2 kagome antiferromagnet, one of the current candidates for a quantum-disordered ground state. We study the influence of the DM term in a related one-dimensional system, the sawtooth chain, which has valence-bond order in its ground state. Through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that a relatively weak DM coupling, 0.115 J, is sufficient to destroy the valence-bond order, close the spin gap, and turn the system into a Luttinger liquid with algebraic spin correlations. A similar mechanism may be at work in the kagome antiferromagnet.",

Since then, a wealth of exactly solvable lattice models have been constructed that have topologically ordered ground states. For a long time, however, it has been difficult to realize Anderson's original vision in such solvable models, according to which the ground state has an unbroken SU (2) spin rotational symmetry and is dominated by fluctuation of singlet bonds. The kagome lattice is the simplest lattice geometry for which parent Hamiltonians stabilizing a prototypical spin-1\/2 short-ranged RVB wave function has been constructed and strong evidence has been given that this state belongs to a topological phase. The uniqueness of the desired RVB-type ground states has, however, not been rigorously proven for the simplest possible such Hamiltonian \u2026",

In this state the bosonic \u03bd= 1 Moore-Read Pfaffian wave function is used to describe a gas of bosonic spin flips on a square lattice with one flux quantum per plaquette. For toroidal geometries there is a three-dimensional space of these states corresponding to the topological degeneracy of the bosonic Moore-Read state on the torus. We show that spin correlations for different states in this space become indistinguishable for large system size.

The braiding properties, which turn out to be the same as in the continuum Moore-Read state, demonstrate the topological attributes of the Moore-Read lattice states in a direct way. We also derive parent Hamiltonians for which the states with quasiholes included are ground states. One advantage of these Hamiltonians lies therein that we can now braid the quasiholes just by changing the coupling strengths in the Hamiltonian since the Hamiltonian is a function of the positions of the quasiholes.

They apply under different conditions, but do not cover the full range of many-body models. It is hence desirable to further expand the toolbox. Here, we propose to use quasiparticle properties to detect quantum phase transitions. The approach is independent from the choice of boundary conditions, and it does not assume a particular lattice structure. The probe is hence suitable for, eg, fractals and quasicrystals. The method requires that one can reliably create quasiparticles in the considered systems. In the simplest cases, this can be done by a pinning potential, while it is less straightforward in more complicated systems. We apply the method to several rather different examples, including one that cannot be handled by the commonly used probes, and in all the cases we find that the numerical \u2026",
