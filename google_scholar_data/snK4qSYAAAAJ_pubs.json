We show that in a thin-film geometry and under external bias, electron-hole pairs that reside in these surface states can condense to form a novel exotic quantum state which we propose to call \u201ctopological exciton condensate\u201d(TEC). This TEC is similar in general terms to the exciton condensate recently argued to exist in a biased graphene bilayer, but with different topological properties. It exhibits a host of unusual properties including a stable zero mode and a fractional charge\u00b1e\/2 carried by a singly quantized vortex in the TEC order parameter.",

We study the experimental signatures of Floquet Majorana fermions in transport measurements and show, both analytically and numerically, that their presence is signaled by a quantized conductance sum rule over discrete values of lead bias differing by multiple absorption or emission energies at drive frequency. We also study the effects of static disorder and find that the quantized sum rule is robust against weak disorder.

In this work, we report a systematic study of the magnetic properties of pyrochlore Y 2 Ir 2 O 7 and its hole-doped compounds by performing magnetic, electron spin resonance, electrical transport, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We demonstrate the existence of weak ferromagnetism on top of a large antiferromagnetic background in the undoped compound.

On interchange, their wavefunction maps either to itself if the particles are bosons, or to minus itself if they are fermions. In two dimensions, a more exotic possibility arises: on exchange of two particles known as anyons, the wavefunction acquires the phase. Such fractional exchange statistics are normally regarded as the hallmark of strong correlations. Here, we describe a theoretical proposal for a system whose excitations are anyons with the exchange phase \u03b8= \u03c0\/4 and charge\u00b1e\/2, but at the same time can be built by filling a set of single-particle states of essentially non-interacting electrons.

This physics can be utilized to realize a valley valve whose behavior is determined optically.
