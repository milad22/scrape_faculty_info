            "Condensed-matter systems have recently become a fertile ground for the discovery of fermionic particles and phenomena predicted in high-energy physics; examples include Majorana fermions, as well as Dirac and Weyl semimetals. However, fermions in condensed-matter systems are not constrained by Poincare symmetry. Instead, they must only respect the crystal symmetry of one of the 230 space groups. Hence, there is the potential to find and classify free fermionic excitations in solid-state systems that have no high-energy counterparts.The guiding principle of our classification is to find irreducible representations of the little group of lattice symmetries at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) for each of the 230 space groups (SGs), the dimension of which corresponds to the number of bands that meet at the high-symmetry point.

            "Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across \u2026",

The formulas in the existing literature are frequently incomplete, incorrect, or lack a derivation; in particular, Hall viscosity is overlooked. Our approach begins from the response to a uniform external strain field, which is an active time-dependent coordinate transformation in d space dimensions. These transformations form the group GL (d, R) of invertible matrices, and the infinitesimal generators are called strain generators. These enable us to express the Kubo formula in different ways, related by Ward identities; some of these make contact with the adiabatic transport approach.

The double crystallographic groups are required in the study of physical systems whose Hamiltonian includes spin-dependent terms. In the symmetry analysis of such systems, instead of the irreducible representations of the space groups, it is necessary to consider the single- and double-valued irreducible representations of the double space groups. The new section includes databases of symmetry operations (DGENPOS) and of irreducible representations of the double (point and space) groups (REPRESENTATIONS DPG and REPRESENTATIONS DSG).

It can be used to drive a quantum system to a desired (unique) steady state, which can be an exotic phase of matter difficult to stabilize in nature. It can also be used to drive a system to a unitarily evolving subspace, which can be used to store, protect, and process quantum information. In this paper, we derive a formula for the map corresponding to asymptotic (infinite-time) Lindbladian evolution and use it to study several important features of the unique state and subspace cases. We quantify how subspaces retain information about initial states and show how to use Lindbladians to simulate any quantum channels. We show that the quantum information in all subspaces can be successfully manipulated by \u2026",

We prove that elementary band representations are either connected as bands in the Brillouin zone and are described by localized Wannier orbitals respecting the symmetries of the lattice (including time reversal when applicable), or, if disconnected, describe topological insulators.
