            "The p\u2013n junction is the functional element of many electronic and optoelectronic devices, including diodes, bipolar transistors, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and solar cells. In conventional p\u2013n junctions, the adjacent p-and n-type regions of a semiconductor are formed by chemical doping. Ambipolar semiconductors, such as carbon nanotubes 1, nanowires 2 and organic molecules 3, allow for p\u2013n junctions to be configured and modified by electrostatic gating. This electrical control enables a single device to have multiple functionalities. Here, we report ambipolar monolayer WSe 2 devices in which two local gates are used to define ap\u2013n junction within the WSe 2 sheet. With these electrically tunable p\u2013n junctions, we demonstrate both p\u2013n and n\u2013p diodes with ideality factors better than 2. Under optical excitation, the diodes demonstrate a photodetection responsivity of 210 mA W\u20131 and photovoltaic power \u2026",

Through a combination of in situ vacuum annealing and electrostatic gating we obtained ohmic contact to the MoS2 down to 4 K at high carrier densities. At lower carrier densities, low-temperature four probe transport measurements show a metal\u2013insulator transition in both monolayer and bilayer samples. In the metallic regime, the high-temperature behavior of the mobility showed strong temperature dependence consistent with phonon-dominated transport. At low temperature, intrinsic field-effect mobilities approaching 1000 cm2\/(V\u00b7s) were observed for both monolayer and bilayer devices. Mobilities extracted from Hall effect measurements were several times lower and showed a strong dependence on density, likely caused by screening of charged impurity scattering at higher \u2026",

Most experiments have focused on quantum dots made from III\u2013V semiconductors; however, the coherence of electron spins in these materials is limited by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins 3, 4, 5, 6. Ge\/Si core\/shell nanowires seem ideally suited to overcome this limitation, because the most abundant nuclei in Ge and Si have spin zero and the nanowires can be chemically synthesized defect-free with tunable properties 7. Here, we present a double quantum dot based on Ge\/Si nanowires in which we can completely control the coupling between the dots and to the leads. We also demonstrate that charge on the double dot can be detected by coupling it capacitively to an adjacent nanowire quantum dot.

We observe strong isotope effects in spin-blockaded transport, and from the magnetic field dependence estimate the hyperfine coupling in 13 C nanotubes to be of the order of 100 \u03bceV, two orders of magnitude larger than anticipated 8, 9. 13 C-enhanced nanotubes are an interesting system for spin-based \u2026",

In order to correlate mineral surface charges with ionic characteristics and corresponding isoelectric points (pI) of amino acids, we immersed quartz and calcite in solutions of six amino acids. Quartz (pHpzc \u2248 2.8) tends to adsorb amino acids most strongly when pHpzc and pI differ significantly. Thus quartz adsorbs lysine (pI = 9.74) more strongly than amino acids with lower pI.
