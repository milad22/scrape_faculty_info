            "Long QT syndromes (LQTS) are heritable diseases characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which often leads to syncope and sudden cardiac death. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stems (iPS) cells from two patients with LQTS type 3 carrying a different point mutation in a sodium channel Nav1.5 (p.V240M and p.R535Q) and functional characterization of cardiomyocytes (CM) derived from them. The iPS cells exhibited all characteristic properties of pluripotent stem cells, maintained the disease-specific mutation and readily differentiated to CM. The duration of action potentials at 50% and 90% repolarization was longer in LQTS-3 CM as compared to control CM but this difference did not reach statistical significance due to high variations among cells. Sodium current recordings demonstrated longer time to peak and longer time to 90% of inactivation of the Na+ channel in the LQTS-3 CM. This hints at a defective Na+ channel caused by deficiency in open-state inactivation of the Na+ channel that is characteristic of LQTS-3. These analyses suggest that the effect of channel mutation in the diseased CM is demonstrated in vitro and that the iPS cell-derived CM can serve as a model system for studying the pathophysiology of LQTS-3, toxicity testing and design of novel therapeutics. However, further improvements in the model are still required to reduce cell-to-cell and cell line-to-cell line variability.",

Bisulfite treatment degrades DNA and reduces its complexity, rendering methylation analysis from small amounts of DNA extremely challenging. Here we describe a simple approach that allows determining the parent-specific methylation patterns of multiple genes in individual early embryos. Limiting dilution (LD) of bisulfite-treated DNA is combined with independent multiplex PCRs of single DNA target molecules to avoid amplification bias. Using this approach, we compared the methylation status of three imprinted (H19, Snrpn and Igf2r) and one pluripotency-related gene (Oct4) in three different groups of single mouse two-cell embryos.

It has been suggested that iPSC retain some tissue-specific memory whereas little is known about interindividual epigenetic variation. We have reprogrammed mesenchymal stromal cells from human bone marrow (iP-MSC) and compared their DNA methylation profiles with initial MSC and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using high-density DNA methylation arrays covering more than 450,000 CpG sites. Overall, DNA methylation patterns of iP-MSC and ESC were similar whereas some CpG sites revealed highly significant differences, which were not related to parental MSC. Furthermore, hypermethylation in iP-MSC versus ESC occurred preferentially outside of CpG islands and was enriched in genes involved in epidermal differentiation indicating that these differences are not due to random de novo \u2026",

The underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, 3 months old male C57BL\/6 mice were socially isolated by individual housing for another 3 months. At the age of 6 months, epigenetic changes were analyzed in midbrain. Social isolation of male adult mice led to an increased global DNA methylation, which was associated with enhanced activity of DNA methyltransferase. Di-and trimethylation of global histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) were increased in midbrain of socially isolated mice, accompanied by enhanced H3K4 histone methyltransferase activity. In addition, social isolation of adult mice led to activation of histone acetyltransferases as well as of histone deacetylases (HDAC) resulting in a net enhancement of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation. Gene-specific effects were observed for Hdac1, Hdac3 and the serotonin transporter Slc6a4. Social isolation led to an up-regulation of Hdac1 and Hdac3, associated with decreased DNA methylation in the CpG island of the respective genes. On the contrary, the Slc6a4 gene was down-regulated, which was associated with enhanced DNA methylation. Collectively, the results from the present study demonstrate for the first time that social isolation of adult mice leads to a wide range of global epigenetic changes and these effects may have profound impact on gene expression pattern and phenotype of the socially isolated animals.",

            "Genomic imprinting is a process that causes genes to be expressed from one allele only according to parental origin, the other allele being silent. Diseases can arise when the normally active alleles are not expressed. In this context, low level of expression of the normally silent alleles has been considered as genetic noise although such expression has never been further studied. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disease involving imprinted genes, including NDN, which are only expressed from the paternally inherited allele, with the maternally inherited allele silent. We present the first in-depth study of the low expression of a normally silent imprinted allele, in pathological context. Using a variety of qualitative and quantitative approaches and comparing wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mice deleted for Ndn, we show that, in absence of the paternal Ndn allele, the maternal Ndn allele is expressed at an extremely low level with a high degree of non-genetic heterogeneity. The level of this expression is sex-dependent and shows transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In about 50% of mutant mice, this expression reduces birth lethality and severity of the breathing deficiency, correlated with a reduction in the loss of serotonergic neurons. In wild-type brains, the maternal Ndn allele is never expressed. However, using several mouse models, we reveal a competition between non-imprinted Ndn promoters which results in monoallelic (paternal or maternal) Ndn expression, suggesting that Ndn allelic exclusion occurs in the absence of imprinting regulation. Importantly, specific expression of the maternal NDN allele is \u2026",
