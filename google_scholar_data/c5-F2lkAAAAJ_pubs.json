With this addition, the ACT collaboration has reported a total of 91 optically confirmed, SZ detected clusters. The 504 square degree survey region includes 270 square degrees of overlap with SDSS Stripe 82, permitting the confirmation of SZ cluster candidates in deep archival optical data.

One newly discovered cluster, ACT-CL J0102\u20134915, with a redshift of 0.75 (photometric), has an SZ decrement comparable to the most massive systems at lower redshifts. Simulations of the cluster recovery method reproduce the sample purity measured by optical follow-up. In particular, for clusters detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than six, simulations are consistent with optical follow-up that demonstrated this subsample is 100% pure.

We verify our detection by calculating the levels of potential contaminants and performing a number of null tests. The resulting convergence power spectrum at 2 angular scales measures the amplitude of matter density fluctuations on comoving length scales of around 100 Mpc at redshifts around 0.5 to 3. The measured amplitude of the signal agrees with Lambda cold dark matter cosmology predictions. Since the amplitude of the convergence power spectrum scales as the square of the amplitude of the density fluctuations, the 4 \u03c3 detection of the lensing signal measures the amplitude of density fluctuations to 12%.",

            "We present the temperature power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) derived from the three seasons of data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 148 GHz and 218 GHz, as well as the cross-frequency spectrum between the two channels. We detect and correct for contamination due to the Galactic cirrus in our equatorial maps. We present the results of a number of tests for possible systematic error and conclude that any effects are not significant compared to the statistical errors we quote. Where they overlap, we cross-correlate the ACT and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) maps and show they are consistent. The measurements of higher-order peaks in the CMB power spectrum provide an additional test of the \u039bCDM cosmological model, and help constrain extensions beyond the standard model. The small angular scale power spectrum also provides constraining power on the \u2026",

            "We report on a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The anisotropy is measured in 23 different multipole bands from l= 54 (\u2248 3) to l= 404 (\u2248 0 fdg 45) and in six frequency bands from 26 to 46 GHz over three observing seasons. The measurements are consistent from year to year. The frequency spectral index of the fluctuations (measured at low l) is consistent with that of the CMB and inconsistent with either dust or Galactic free-free emission. Furthermore, the observations of the MSAM1-92 experiment (Cheng et al. 1994) are repeated and confirmed. The angular spectrum shows a distinct rise from \u03b4T l\u2261[l (2l+ 1) lang| a m l| 2 rang\/4\u03c0] 1\/2= 49+ 8\u2212 5 \u03bcK at l= 87 to \u03b4T l= 85+ 10\u2212 8 \u03bcK at l= 237.

Four regions of sky covering a total of 270 square degrees were mapped with an angular resolution of 1.3'. The map noise levels in the four regions are between 11 and 17 \u03bcK-arcmin. We present TT, TE, EE, TB, EB, and BB power spectra from three of these regions. The observed E-mode polarization power spectrum, displaying six acoustic peaks in the range 200< \u2113< 3000, is an excellent fit to the prediction of the best-fit cosmological models from WMAP9+ ACT and Planck data. The polarization power spectrum, which mainly reflects primordial plasma velocity perturbations, provides an independent determination of cosmological parameters consistent with those based on the temperature power \u2026",
