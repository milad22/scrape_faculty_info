            "The paper describes the engineering and design of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), using back-to-back PWM voltage-source converters in the rotor circuit. A vector-control scheme for the supply-side PWM converter results in independent control of active and reactive power drawn from the supply, while ensuring sinusoidal supply currents. Vector control of the rotor-connected converter provides for wide speed-range operation; the vector scheme is embedded in control loops which enable optimal speed tracking for maximum energy capture from the wind. An experimental rig, which represents a 7.5 kW variable speed wind-energy generation system is described, and experimental results are given that illustrate the excellent performance characteristics of the system. The paper considers a grid-connected system; a further paper will describe a stand-alone system.",

Two back-to-back PWM voltage-fed inverters connected between the stator and the rotor allow sub- and super-synchronous operation with low distortion currents. The load voltage is maintained at constant frequency and its magnitude is regulated through control of the stator flux of the generator. An auxiliary load is connected in parallel with the main load, and the auxiliary power is controlled to allow the DFIG to track the optimal wind turbine speed for maximum energy capture from the wind. An indirect stator-orientated vector control scheme is used to control the DFIG and this results in constant load voltage and frequency for variations in both load and wind speed. The techniques have been implemented and validated on a 7.5 kW experimental rig.",

The SRG is controlled to drive a wind energy conversion system (WECS) to the point of maximum aerodynamic efficiency using closed loop control of the power output. In the medium and low speed range, the SRG phase current is regulated using pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control of the magnetizing voltage. For high speeds the generator is controlled using a single pulse mode. In order to interface the SRG to the grid (or ac load) a voltage-source PWM inverter is used. A 2.5-kW experimental prototype has been constructed. Wind turbine characteristics are emulated using a cage induction machine drive. The performance of the system has been tested over the whole speed range using wind profiles and power impacts. Experimental results are presented confirming the \u2026",

The dynamic response of such circuits is complex. It is essential to identify the dominant oscillation modes in the system so that electromagnetic interference (EMI) reduction techniques can be effectively implemented. This paper (Part I) investigates the mechanisms of conducted EMI emissions associated with a typical PWM inverter induction motor drive system. A numerical model, which includes the high-frequency effects within the machine, is established to evaluate the emissions in the time domain. The dominant high-frequency current paths are identified, and this allows the oscillation frequencies to be predicted from knowledge of the component values. The analysis is confirmed using \u2026",

            "This letter presents a fault detection method for modular multilevel converters which is capable of locating a faulty semiconductor switching device in the circuit. The proposed fault detection method is based on a sliding mode observer (SMO) and a switching model of a half-bridge, the approach taken is to conjecture the location of fault, modify the SMO accordingly and then compare the observed and measured states to verify, or otherwise, the assumption. This technique requires no additional measurement elements and can easily be implemented in a DSP or microcontroller. The operation and robustness of the fault detection technique are confirmed by simulation results for the fault condition of a semiconductor switching device appearing as an open circuit.",
