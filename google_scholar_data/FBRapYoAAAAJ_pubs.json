The spectrum and radiative widths are evaluated using two models, the relativized Godfrey-Isgur model and a nonrelativistic potential model. The electromagnetic transitions are evaluated using Coulomb plus linear plus smeared hyperfine wave functions, both in a nonrelativistic potential model and in the Godfrey-Isgur model. The open-flavor strong decay amplitudes are determined assuming harmonic oscillator wave functions and the P 3 0 decay model.

The spin-1\/2 ladder may be realized in nature by vanadyl pyrophosphate,(VO) 2 P 2 O 7. In this paper we apply strong-coupling perturbation theory, spin-wave theory, Lanczos techniques, and a Monte Carlo method to determine the ground-state energy and the low-lying excitation spectrum of the ladder. We find evidence of a nonzero spin gap for all interchain couplings J\u22a5> 0. A band of spin-triplet excitations above the gap is also analyzed.

During his term as spokesperson for B \u516b B \u516b R he laid down a vision for the two B Factory detector collaborations, B \u516b B \u516b R and Belle, to work together on a book that would describe the methodologies used and physics results obtained by those experiments. A key ideal emphasized from the outset was that this book should be written from a pedagogical perspective; it should be of interest to the student and expert alike. This vision was presented during a B \u516b B \u516b R collaboration meeting on the island of Elba in May 2008 and a follow up Belle collaboration meeting at KEK, with visiting colleagues from the B \u516b B \u516b R collaboration, and was embraced by the community. A number of workshops involving people from the theoretical community as well as the two collaborations were held on four continents over the following years. The resulting book,\u201cThe Physics of the B Factories\u201d, is a testament to the way that this concept captured the zeitgeist on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.This book is divided into three parts, the first of which provides a brief description of the B Factories, including a short (though not exhaustive) historical perspective, as well as descriptions of the detectors, ancillary data acquisition systems and data (re) processing systems that were built by the two detector collaborations in the late 1990\u2019s. The second part of the book discusses tools and methods that are frequently used when analyzing the data collected. These range from details of low level reconstruction algorithms and abstract summaries of statistical methods to high level prescriptions used when \u2026",

            "Quark confinement and the genesis of the constituent quark model are examined in nonperturbative QCD in Coulomb gauge. We employ a self-consistent method to construct a quasiparticle basis and to determine the quasiparticle interaction. The results agree remarkably well with lattice computations. They also illustrate the mechanism by which confinement and constituent quarks emerge, provide support for the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario, clarify several perplexing issues in the constituent quark model, and permit the construction of an improved model of low energy QCD.",
