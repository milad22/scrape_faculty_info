            "High-transition-temperature superconductivity arises in copper oxides when holes or electrons are doped into the CuO 2 planes of their insulating parent compounds. Whereas hole doping quickly induces metallic behaviour and superconductivity in many cuprates, electron doping alone is insufficient in materials such as R 2 CuO 4 (R is Nd, Pr, La, Ce and so on), where it is necessary to anneal an as-grown sample in a low-oxygen environment to remove a tiny amount of oxygen in order to induce superconductivity. Here we show that the microscopic process of oxygen reduction repairs Cu deficiencies in the as-grown materials and creates oxygen vacancies in the stoichiometric CuO 2 planes, effectively reducing disorder and providing itinerant carriers for superconductivity. The resolution of this long-standing materials issue suggests that the fundamental mechanism for superconductivity is the same for electron \u2026",

            "Charge-lattice fluctuations are observed in the layered perovskite manganite LaSr 2 Mn 2 O 7 by Raman spectroscopy at temperatures as high as 340 K, and with decreasing temperature they become static, forming a charge-ordered (CO) phase below T CO= 210 K. In the static regime, superlattice reflections are observed by neutron and x-ray diffraction with a propagation vector (1\/4,-1\/4, 0). Crystallographic analysis of the CO state demonstrates that the degree of charge and orbital ordering in this manganite is weaker than that in the three-dimensional perovskite manganites. Below T N= 170 K, type-A antiferromagnetism (AF) develops and competes with the charge ordering, causing it to eventually melt below T*= 100 K. High-resolution diffraction measurements suggest that the CO and AF states do not coincide within the same region of material, but rather coexist as separate phases. The transition to type-A \u2026",

This glass transition suggests that the paramagnetic\/insulating state arises from an inherent orbital frustration that inhibits the formation of a long-range orbital-and charge-ordered state. Upon further cooling into the ferromagnetic-metallic state (T C= 114 K), where the polarons melt, the diffuse scattering quickly develops into a propagating, transverse optic phonon.",
