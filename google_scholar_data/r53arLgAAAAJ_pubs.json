            "We present a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the effect of electron-phonon interactions on molecular transistors, including both quantal and classical limits. We study both equilibrated and out of equilibrium phonons. We present detailed results for conductance, noise, and phonon distribution in two regimes. One involves temperatures large as compared to the rate of electronic transitions on and off the dot; in this limit our approach yields classical rate equations, which are solved numerically for a wide range of parameters. The other regime is that of low temperatures and weak electron-phonon coupling where a perturbative approximation in the Keldysh formulation can be applied. The interplay between the phonon-induced renormalization of the density of states on the quantum dot and the phonon-induced renormalization of the dot-lead coupling is found to be important. Whether or not the phonons are \u2026",

A circularly polarized laser also drives the system out of equilibrium, resulting in nonthermal electron distribution functions that strongly affect transport properties. Results are presented for the Hall conductance for two different cases. One is for a closed system, such as a cold-atomic gas, where transverse drift due to nonzero Berry curvature can be measured in time-of-flight measurements. For this case the effect of a circularly polarized laser that has been suddenly switched on is studied. The second is for an open system coupled to an external reservoir of phonons. While for the former the Hall conductance is far from the quantized limit, for the latter, coupling to a sufficiently low temperature reservoir of phonons is found to produce effective cooling, and thus an \u2026",

To this end, we apply a Floquet kinetic equation approach to study two-dimensional Dirac fermions irradiated by a circularly polarized laser, a system which is predicted to be in a laser-induced quantum Hall state. We find that the initial electron distribution shows an anisotropy with momentum-dependent spin textures whose properties are controlled by the switching-on protocol of the laser. The phonons then smoothen this out, leading to a nontrivial isotropic nonequilibrium distribution which has no memory of the initial state and initial switch-on protocol, and yet is distinct from a thermal state. An analytical expression for the distribution at the Dirac point is obtained that is relevant for observing quantized transport.",

The time evolution of the domain wall profile as well as various two-point spin correlation functions are studied by the exact solution of the fermionic problem for the X X chain and via a bosonization approach and a mean-field approach for the X X Z chain. At long times the magnetization is found to equilibrate (reach the ground state value), while the two-point correlation functions in general do not.

In these three regimes, the correlation function is found to decay with power laws with nonequilibrium exponents that differ from those in equilibrium, as well as from those obtained from quenches in a quadratic Luttinger liquid theory.
