However, the traffic load can have significant spatial and temporal fluctuations, which bring both challenges and opportunities to the planning and operating of cellular networks. This article introduces a concept of cell zooming, which adaptively adjusts the cell size according to traffic load, user requirements and channel conditions. The implementation issues of cell zooming are then presented. Finally a usage case of cell zooming for energy saving is investigated. Centralized and distributed cell zooming algorithms are developed, and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can greatly reduce the energy consumption, which leads to green cellular networks.",

To support the huge power demand of HCNs, renewable energy harvesting technologies can be leveraged. In this paper, we aim to make efficient use of the harvested energy for on-grid power saving while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirement. To this end, energy-aware traffic offloading schemes are proposed, whereby user associations, ON-OFF states of SBSs, and power control are jointly optimized according to the statistical information of energy arrival and traffic load.

An energy saving algorithm is proposed by dynamically adjusting the working modes (active or sleeping) of BSs according to the traffic variation with respect to certain blocking probability requirement. In addition, to prevent frequent mode switching, BSs are set to hold their current working modes for at least a given interval. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy can greatly reduce energy consumption with blocking probability guarantee, and the performance is insensitive to the mode holding time within certain range.",

Specifically, the control coverage is guaranteed by macro base stations (MBSs), whereas small cells (SCs) are only utilized for data transmission. Under HCN, SCs can be dynamically turned off when traffic load decreases for energy saving. A fundamental problem then arises: how many SCs can be turned off as traffic varies? In this paper, we address this problem in a theoretical way, where two sleeping schemes (i.e., random and repulsive schemes) with vertical inter-layer offloading are considered. Analytical results indicate the following facts: 1) under the random scheme where SCs are turned off with certain probability, the expected ratio of sleeping SCs is inversely proportional to the traffic \u2026",
