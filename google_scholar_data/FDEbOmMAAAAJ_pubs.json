            "In this paper we find that the stretched-exponential relaxation commonly observed in disordered systems is explained by time-dependent atomic diffusion. The relaxation is observed in the electronic properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H), a \u2018\u2018hydrogen glass\u2019\u2019material, and reflects the equlibration of localized electronic states. The relaxation is attributed to the motion of bonded hydrogen which exhibits dispersive diffusion with a characteristic power-law time dependence. A quantitative relation between the relaxation and the diffusion is established.",

Measurements of electronic transport are reported, with particular emphasis on the effects of annealing and cooling the samples. Two regimes of behavior are observed. When samples are cooled below a temperature T E, the electronic and atomic structures slowly relax with a temperature-dependent time constant. In n-type samples the relaxation time is several weeks at room temperature, and T E is\u223c 130 C. In p-type samples the time constant is a few hours and T E is\u223c 80 C. The second regime above T E corresponds to a relaxation time short compared to experimental times, and the structure attains a metastable thermal equilibrium. We show that the defect-compensation model of doping provides an accurate phenomenological \u2026",

The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study concentration variations within a mixture of different sized spheres segregated in this manner indicates a more complicated structure within the bulk than can be observed or even inferred from surface measurements. Moreover, when the rotation speed is reduced and the homogeneous mixed state appears to be restored on the surface, the MRI data reveals that the radially segregated state persists.",

Decreasing the rotation speed to\u223c 5 rpm causes the bands to disappear, restoring the mixed state.

            "Experimental measurements of axial segregation of binary mixtures of granular media combined in a horizontal cylinder and rotated like a drum mixer are reported. While in the traditional axial segregation effect the mixture of two different sizes of granular media will separate into bands of relatively pure single concentrations along the axis of rotation, in special cases the homogeneous mixed state can be restored simply by decreasing the speed of rotation. Systematic variation of the relative diameters of the components reveal three classes of behavior: no segregation at any rotation speed, a nonreversible axial segregation, and an axial segregation at high speeds that reverses back into the mixed state at low speeds. Measurements of the dynamic angle of repose of the mixed and segregated phases as a function of rotation speed support a model for the axial segregation effect that involves a diffusion equation \u2026",

The decay kinetics for these light-induced defects is related to the dispersive diffusion of hydrogen in \u03b1\u2212 Si: H providing strong support for the hypothesis that hydrogen motion is involved in the defect formation process. Mechanisms involving the motion of other defects motions, such as three-or fivefold coordinated silicon atoms, are found to be unlikely.",
