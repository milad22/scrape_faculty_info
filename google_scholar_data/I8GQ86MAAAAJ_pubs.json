The stochastically cooled proton beam and the used detection system allowed to determine the momenta of the outgoing protons with a precision of 4 MeV\u2215 c (\u03c3) in the center-of-mass frame. The determination of the four-momentum vectors of both outgoing protons allowed to derive the complete kinematical information of the \u03b7 p p system.

A description taking the proton-proton and the \u03b7-proton interaction into account and assuming an on-shell incoherent pairwise interaction among the produced particles fails to explain this strong effect.

Some of the approximations involved in the construction of the effective interaction are discussed and several of its dynamical properties are examined. Selected properties of the present interaction are also compared with those of a similar G-matrix interaction based on the Paris potential as well as with those of a recent t-matrix interaction based directly on nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. The role of medium corrections as well as the utility of the present interaction are studied by applying it to a variety of transitions in nucleon-nucleus scattering where important constraints on the transition densities are available from electron scattering.",

A comparison with preliminary data from SATURNE calls for the inclusion of off-shell form factors at the NN \u03c9 and \u03c0 \u03c1 \u03c9 production vertices. Due to the present lack of knowledge of these form factors, together with the destructive interference mentioned above, the relative magnitude of the nucleonic and meson-exchange current contributions cannot be determined from existing total cross section data. However, it is shown that the angular distribution of the produced \u03c9 mesons provides a unique and clear signature of the magnitude of these currents, thus allowing one to disentangle these two basic reaction mechanisms.",
