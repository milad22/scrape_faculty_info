            "Dynein and kinesin motor proteins transport cellular cargoes toward opposite ends of microtubule tracks. In neurons, microtubules are abundantly decorated with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as tau. Motor proteins thus encounter MAPs frequently along their path. To determine the effects of tau on dynein and kinesin motility, we conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau. Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was sufficient to inhibit motor activity. The differential modulation of dynein and kinesin motility suggests that MAPs can spatially regulate the balance of microtubule-dependent axonal transport.",

            "The microtubule motors kinesin and dynein function collectively to drive vesicular transport. High-resolution tracking of vesicle motility in the cell indicates that transport is often bidirectional, characterized by frequent directional changes. However, the mechanisms coordinating the collective activities of oppositely oriented motors bound to the same cargo are not well understood. To examine motor coordination, we purified neuronal transport vesicles and analyzed their motility via automated particle tracking with nanometer resolution. The motility of purified vesicles reconstituted in vitro closely models the movement of LysoTracker-positive vesicles in primary neurons, where processive bidirectional motility is interrupted with frequent directional switches, diffusional movement, and pauses. Quantitative analysis indicates that vesicles copurify with a low number of stably bound motors: one to five dynein and one to four \u2026",

Dynactin, a large multi-subunit activator of dynein, docks cargo to the motor and may enhance dynein processivity. Here, we show that individual fluorescently labelled dynein\u2013dynactin complexes exhibit bidirectional and processive motility towards both the plus and minus ends of microtubules. The dependence of this activity on substrate ATP concentration, nucleotide analogues and inhibitors suggests that bidirectional motility is an active energy-transduction property of dynein\u2013dynactin motor mechano-chemistry.

In this study, we demonstrate through yeast two-hybrid and affinity chromatography assays that Htt and dynein intermediate chain interact directly; endogenous Htt and dynein coimmunoprecipitate from mouse brain cytosol. Htt RNAi in HeLa cells results in Golgi disruption, similar to the effects of compromising dynein\/dynactin function. In vitro studies reveal that Htt and dynein are both present on vesicles purified from mouse brain.

Unlike other cytoskeletal filaments (e.g., actin) that work as large networks, microtubules work individually or in small groups, so their individual mechanical properties are quite important to their cellular function.

To test motor function at microtubule intersections, crossovers were arranged in vitro using flow to orient successive layers of filaments. Single kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin molecules fused with green-fluorescent protein, and artificial bead cargos decorated with multiple motors, were observed while they encountered intersections. Single kinesins tend to cross intersecting microtubules, whereas single dynein-dynactins have a more varied response. For bead cargos, kinesin motion is independent of motor number.
