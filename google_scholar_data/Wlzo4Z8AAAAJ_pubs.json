            "Today\u2019s dominant photovoltaic technologies rely on single-junction devices, which are approaching their practical efficiency limit of 25\u201327%. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to multi-junction devices, which consist of two or more stacked subcells, each absorbing a different part of the solar spectrum. Here, we show that dual-junction III\u2013V\/\/Sidevices with mechanically stacked, independently operated III\u2013V and Si cells reach cumulative one-sun efficiencies up to 32.8%. Efficiencies up to 35.9% were achieved when combining a GaInP\/GaAs dual-junction cell with a Si single-junction cell. These efficiencies exceed both the theoretical 29.4% efficiency limit of conventional Si technology and the efficiency of the record III\u2013V dual-junction device (32.6%), highlighting the potential of Si-based multi-junction solar cells. However, techno-economic analysis reveals an order-of-magnitude disparity between the \u2026",

In one tuning step, a few monolayers of material are removed from the cavity surface by etching a self-formed native oxide in 1mol citric acid. Due to the self-limiting oxide thickness, total tuning range is based only on the number of etch steps, resulting in a highly controlled, digital tuning ability. We have characterized the tuning behavior of GaAs PC defect cavities of both square and triangular lattice symmetry and proven the effectiveness of this method by tuning a mode into resonance with the charged exciton, and then later the biexciton, transition of a single InAs\u2215GaAs self-assembled quantum dot.",

A promising approach to tackle this challenge is through thin film photovoltaics made of elements that are abundant in the Earth\u2019s crust. In this work, we focus on Cu2SnS3, a promising earth abundant absorber material. Recent publications have presented 3% and 6% device efficiencies using Cu2SnS3-based absorber materials and alloys, respectively. However, little is understood about the fundamental defect and doping physics of this material, which is needed for further improvements in device performance. Here, we identify the origins of the changes in doping in sputtered cubic Cu2SnS3 thin films using combinatorial experiments and first-principles theory.

As ternary analogs to the III\u2013V materials, these compounds share many of the attractive features that have made the III\u2013Vs the basis of modern optoelectronic devices (e.g. high mobility, strong optical absorption). Control of cation order parameter in the II\u2013IV\u2013V2 materials can produce significant changes in optoelectronic properties at fixed chemical composition, including decoupling band gap from lattice parameter.

ZnSn N 2 is a ternary nitride of interest for photovoltaics, which forms in a wurtzite-derived crystal structure. In the ground state, every N anion is coordinated by two Zn and two Sn cations, thereby observing the octet rule locally. Using a motif-based model Hamiltonian, we performed Monte Carlo simulations that provide atomistic representations of ZnSn N 2 with varying degrees of cation disorder. Subsequent electronic structure calculations describe the evolution of band gaps, optical properties, and carrier localization effects as a function of the disorder. We find that octet-rule conserving disorder is practically impossible to avoid but perfectly benign, with hardly any effects on the electronic structure. In contrast, a fully random cation distribution would be very detrimental, but \u2026",

The dependence of membrane elasticity on bilayer thickness is obtained by adjusting lipid length at constant temperature and surface tension. Additionally, bilayer fluidity at various lipid lengths is quantified by analysis of a length versus temperature phase diagram at vanishing tension. Regions of solid, gel-like (hexatic) and fluid bilayer behavior are established by identification of phase boundaries. The main melting transition is found to be density driven; the melting temperature scales inversely with lipid length since thermal expansion increases with lipid aspect ratio.",
