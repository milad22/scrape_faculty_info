Here, we report a breakthrough toward scalability: the simultaneous generation of a record 15 quadripartite entangled cluster states over 60 consecutive cavity modes (Q modes), in the optical frequency comb of a single optical parametric oscillator. The amount of observed entanglement was constant over the 60 Q modes, thereby proving the intrinsic scalability of this system. The number of observable Q modes was restricted by technical limitations, and we conservatively estimate the actual number of similar clusters to be at least 3 times larger. This result paves the way to the realization of large entangled states for scalable quantum information and quantum computing.",

To take advantage of the Heisenberg limit, 1\/N, for the phase sensitivity, one wants the number of correlated photons, N, to be high. This favors the use of parametric oscillation rather than the weaker but better correlated source given by parametric down-conversion. In real systems, decorrelation arising from photon absorption, mode mismatch, and nonideal detectors must be considered. In this paper we address the problem of detection when correlated photons are used as the input. We study the influence of photon statistics and of imperfect quantum correlation of the input light, and show that it is still possible to break the classical 1\/N phase sensitivity limit in nonideal experimental conditions. All the results are valid in the general case of quantum \u2026",
