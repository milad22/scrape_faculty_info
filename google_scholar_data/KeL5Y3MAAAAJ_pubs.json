            "Extensive experimental data from high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions were recorded using the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The comprehensive set of measurements from the first three years of RHIC operation includes charged particle multiplicities, transverse energy, yield ratios and spectra of identified hadrons in a wide range of transverse momenta (p T), elliptic flow, two-particle correlations, nonstatistical fluctuations, and suppression of particle production at high p T. The results are examined with an emphasis on implications for the formation of a new state of dense matter. We find that the state of matter created at RHIC cannot be described in terms of ordinary color neutral hadrons.",

The details of the experimental method, apparatus, data taking, and analysis are summarized. Data obtained at Brookhaven National Laboratory, using nearly equal samples of positive and negative muons, were used to deduce a \u03bc (Expt)= 11659208.0 (5.4)(3.3)\u00d7 10\u2212 10, where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given, respectively. The combined uncertainty of 0.54 ppm represents a 14-fold improvement compared to previous measurements at CERN. The standard model value for a \u03bc includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes. While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest theoretical uncertainty,\u2248 0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic vacuum polarization.

The nuclear modification factor R AA relative to p+ p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+ Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC energies. A large azimuthal anisotropy v 2 with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5< p T< 5 GeV\/c indicating substantial heavy-flavor elliptic flow. Both R AA and v 2 show a p T dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe R AA (p T) and v 2 (p T) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, ie, near a perfect fluid.",

            "The muon-proton and muon-deuteron inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross sections were measured in the kinematic range 0.002<\u00d7< 0.60 and 0.5< Q 2< 75 GeV 2 at incident muon energies of 90, 120, 200 and 280 GeV. These results are based on the full data set collected by the New Muon Collaboration, including the data taken with a small angle trigger. The extracted values of the structure functions F 2 p and F 2 d are in good agreement with those from other experiments. The data cover a sufficient range of y to allow the determination of the ratio of the longitudinally to transversely polarised virtual photon absorption cross sections, R= \u03c3 L \u03c3 T, for 0.002<\u00d7< 0.12. The values of R are compatible with a perturbative QCD prediction; they agree with earlier measurements and extend to smaller x.",
