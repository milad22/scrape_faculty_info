            "Organic semiconductor-based photovoltaic devices offer the promise of a low-cost photovoltaic technology that could be manufactured via large-scale, roll-to-roll printing techniques. Existing organic photovoltaic devices have currently achieved solar power conversion efficiencies greater than 3%. Although encouraging, the reasons higher efficiencies have not been achieved are poor overlap between the absorption spectrum of the organic chromophores and the solar spectrum, non-ideal band alignment between the donor and acceptor species, and low charge carrier mobilities resulting from the disordered nature of organic semiconductors. To address the latter issues, we are investigating the development of nanostructured oxide\/conjugated polymer composite photovoltaic (PV) devices. These composites can take advantage of the high electron mobilities attainable in oxide semiconductors and can be \u2026",

            "We have studied the stability of the luminescence from porous Si in the presence of a variety of ambient gases (e.g., N2, H2, forming gas, and O2). Although the optical properties are fairly stable under most conditions, illumination in the presence of O2 causes a substantial decrease in luminescence efficiency. Infrared measurements show that the surfaces of degraded samples are oxidized. The luminescence lifetime of the degraded material is found to be substantially reduced, and the density of Si dangling bonds increases by more than two orders of magnitude, which suggests that oxidation of the surface introduces nonradiative recombination channels. These observations indicate that the electronic properties at the surface of the porous Si play a key role in obtaining efficient luminescence from this material.",

For the intrinsic conductivity of the CuO 2 planes a superconducting energy gap of 500 cm\u2212 1 (2\u0394\/kT c\u2243 8) is evident in the infrared data, while the normal-state conductivity drops much more slowly with \u03c9 than the ordinary Drude form, and can be described in terms of a scattering rate \u0127\/\u03c4*\u223c kT+ \u0127\u03c9 at low frequency.

The photovoltaics (PV) area is rapidly evolving based on new materials and deposition approaches. At present, PV is predominately based on crystalline and polycrystalline Si and is growing at >40% per year with production rapidly approaching 3 gigawatts\/year with PV installations supplying <1% of energy used in the world. Increased cell efficiency and reduced manufacturing expenses are critical in achieving reasonable costs for PV and solarthermal. CdTe thin-film solar cells have reported a manufactured cost of $1.25\/watt. There is also the promise of increased efficiency by use of multijunction cells or hybrid devices organized at the nanoscale. This could lead to conversion efficiencies of greater than 50 \u2026",
