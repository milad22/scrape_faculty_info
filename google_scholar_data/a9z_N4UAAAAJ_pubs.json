            "We present an impedance engineered Josephson parametric amplifier capable of providing bandwidth beyond the traditional gain-bandwidth product. We achieve this by introducing a positive linear slope in the imaginary component of the input impedance seen by the Josephson oscillator using a \u03bb\/2 transformer. Our theoretical model predicts an extremely flat gain profile with a bandwidth enhancement proportional to the square root of amplitude gain. We experimentally demonstrate a nearly flat 20\u2009dB gain over a 640\u2009MHz band, along with a mean 1-dB compression point of \u2212110 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. The results are in a good agreement with our theoretical model.",

            "Wave-particle complementarity lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. To illustrate this mysterious feature, Wheeler proposed the delayed-choice experiment, where a quantum system manifests the wave- or particle-like attribute, depending on the experimental arrangement, which is made after the system has entered the interferometer. In recent quantum delayed-choice experiments, these two complementary behaviors were simultaneously observed with a quantum interferometer in a superposition of being closed and open. We suggest and implement a conceptually different quantum delayed-choice experiment by introducing a which-path detector (WPD) that can simultaneously record and neglect the system\u2019s path information, but where the interferometer itself is classical. Our experiment is realized with a superconducting circuit, where a cavity acts as the WPD for an interfering qubit. Using this setup, we \u2026",

We use four transmon qubits coupled to individual rectangular cavities which are aperture-coupled to a common rectangular waveguide feedline. A coaxial to waveguide transformer at the other end of the feedline allows one to launch and collect the multiplexed signal. The reflected readout signal is amplified by an impedance-engineered broadband parametric amplifier with 380\u2009MHz bandwidth. This provides us high fidelity single-shot readout of multiple qubits using compact microwave circuitry, an efficient way for scaling up to more qubits in 3D cQED.",

The agreement with the numerically obtained result is excellent. We also find a different extreme, where the limit cycle is of the relaxation oscillator variety, has a large time period and it is seen that, as a particular parameter in the model is varied, the time period increases indefinitely.

Though the classical formulas produce all primitive triples they do not generate all possible triples, especially non-primitive triples. This paper presents a direct method to generate all possible triples both primitive and non-primitive for any given number. Then the technique is generalized to produce Pythagorean Quadruples and n-tuples. Our method utilizes the fact that the difference between lengths of the hypotenuse and one leg of a Pythagorean triangle can have only certain distinct values depending on the length of the other which remains true for higher tuples also.",

The majority of experiments demonstrating small quantum algorithms in the superconducting architecture have used transmon qubits and transverse qubit-qubit coupling. However, efficient universal digital computing has remained a challenge due to the fact that majority of the state-of-art architectures rely on nearest-neighbor coupling in one or two dimensions. The limited connectivity and the availability of only two-qubit entangling gates result in inefficient implementation of algorithms with reduced fidelity. In this work, we present a programmable three-qubit processor, nicknamed\" trimon\", with strong all-to-all coupling and access to native three-qubit gates. We implement three-qubit version of various algorithms, namely Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Grover's search and the quantum Fourier transform, to demonstrate the performance of our processor. Our results show the potential of the trimon as a building block for larger systems with enhanced qubit-qubit connectivity.",

We report on new protocols for reset, fast coherent control, and readout that allow high-quality operation of the qubit with a 14 MHz transition frequency, an order of magnitude lower in energy than the ambient thermal energy scale. We utilize higher levels of the fluxonium to read out the qubit state and to initialize the qubit with 97% fidelity corresponding to cooling it to 190 \u03bc K. Instead of using standard microwave pulses, we control the qubit only with fast-flux pulses, generating control fields much larger than the qubit frequency.
