            "van der Waals heterostructures constitute a new class of artificial materials formed by stacking atomically thin planar crystals. We demonstrated band structure engineering in a van der Waals heterostructure composed of a monolayer graphene flake coupled to a rotationally aligned hexagonal boron nitride substrate. The spatially varying interlayer atomic registry results in both a local breaking of the carbon sublattice symmetry and a long-range moir\u00e9 superlattice potential in the graphene. In our samples, this interplay between short- and long-wavelength effects resulted in a band structure described by isolated superlattice minibands and an unexpectedly large band gap at charge neutrality. This picture is confirmed by our observation of fractional quantum Hall states at \u00b153 filling and features associated with the Hofstadter butterfly at ultrahigh magnetic fields.",

            "Graphene has demonstrated great promise for future electronics technology as well as fundamental physics applications because of its linear energy\u2013momentum dispersion relations which cross at the Dirac point 1, 2. However, accessing the physics of the low-density region at the Dirac point has been difficult because of disorder that leaves the graphene with local microscopic electron and hole puddles 3, 4, 5. Efforts have been made to reduce the disorder by suspending graphene, leading to fabrication challenges and delicate devices which make local spectroscopic measurements difficult 6, 7. Recently, it has been shown that placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) yields improved device performance 8. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to show that graphene conforms to hBN, as evidenced by the presence of Moir\u00e9 patterns.

As the width of the quantum point contact is increased, its electrical conductance increases in quantized steps of 2e2\/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck9s constant. The angular dependence of the electron flow on each step agrees with theory, and fringes separated by half the electron wavelength are observed. Placing the tip so that it interrupts the flow from particular modes of the quantum point contact causes a reduction in the conductance of those particular conduction channels below 2e2\/h without affecting other channels.",
