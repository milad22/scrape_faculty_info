            "Scenarios of changes in biodiversity for the year 2100 can now be developed based on scenarios of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate, vegetation, and land use and the known sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the \u2026",

Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year\u20131) globally for 1990 to 2007. We also estimate a source of 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 Pg C year\u20131 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 Pg C year\u20131 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 \u00b1 0.5 Pg C year\u20131. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 \u00b1 0.8 Pg C year\u20131, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties.

Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage.

Until recently, similar studies were impossible for microorganisms, arguably the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth. Here, we present a continental-scale description of soil bacterial communities and the environmental factors influencing their biodiversity. We collected 98 soil samples from across North and South America and used a ribosomal DNA-fingerprinting method to compare bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites. Bacterial diversity was unrelated to site temperature, latitude, and other variables that typically predict plant and animal diversity, and community composition was largely independent of geographic distance. The diversity and richness of soil bacterial communities differed by ecosystem type, and these differences could largely be explained by soil \u2026",

We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient \u03b2 to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). \u03b2 is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-\u03b2d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of \u03b2 correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (\u03b2=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80\u201390% of roots in the \u2026",

            "Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH4 L-1 (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L-1 (P < 0.05; n = 34). Average \u03b413C-CH4 values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for \u2026",

            "Programmes that aim to reduce the emissions from deforestation and forest degradation are being considered as a cost-effective way to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions1. Deforestation and forest degradation contribute to atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions through combustion of forest biomass and decomposition of remaining plant material and soil carbon. Within the science and policy communities, carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation have been estimated to account for about 20% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions2\u20135. A recalculation of this fraction using the same methods, but updated estimates on carbon emissions from both deforestation and fossil fuel combustion suggests that in 2008, the relative contribution of CO 2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation was substantially smaller, around 12%. As a consequence, the maximum carbon \u2026",
