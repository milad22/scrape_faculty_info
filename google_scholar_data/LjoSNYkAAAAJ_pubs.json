            "Advanced materials characterization techniques with ever-growing data acquisition speed and storage capabilities represent a challenge in modern materials science and new procedures to quickly assess and analyze the data are needed. Machine learning approaches are effective in reducing the complexity of data and rapidly homing in on the underlying trend in multi-dimensional data. Here, we show that by employing an algorithm called the mean shift theory to a large amount of diffraction data in high-throughput experimentation, one can streamline the process of delineating the structural evolution across compositional variations mapped on combinatorial libraries with minimal computational cost. Data collected at a synchrotron beamline are analyzed on the fly and by integrating experimental data with the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), we can substantially enhance the accuracy in classifying \u2026",

This strategy increases the efficiency of the DFT-based GA by several orders of magnitude. This gain allows a considerable increase in the size and complexity of systems that can be studied by first principles. The performance of the method is illustrated by successful structure identifications of complex binary and ternary intermetallic compounds with 36 and 54 atoms per cell, respectively. The discovery of a multi-TPa Mg-silicate phase with unit cell containing up to 56 atoms is also reported. Such a phase is likely to be an essential component of terrestrial exoplanetary mantles.",

The newly discovered structures are further shown to be dynamically and mechanically stable, and possess electronic properties consistent with existing experimental observations. In particular, their layered nature is expected to prevail over other structural forms at the interfaces of thin-film solar cells, and knowledge about the precise atomic structures of the interfaces is a prerequisite for achieving long-term stability and high efficiency of CdTe and Cu (In, Ga) Se 2 solar cells.",

Second, using a statistical model parametrized by the results of ab initio calculations and experimental data, the adsorption and desorption of molecular hydrogens are calculated at ambient temperature and pressure. We find that the usable capacity at ambient conditions is dramatically reduced from the maximum capacity, the zero-point energy affects the storage capacity significantly, and the optimal binding energy of H 2 molecules under practical conditions is\u223c 0.3 eV\u2215 H 2 \u2026",

Advances in computer speed and algorithm sophistication have now made it feasible to predict the crystal structure of an unknown phase without any assumptions on the Bravais lattice type, atom basis, or unit cell dimensions, providing a novel approach to aid experiments in exploring complex materials with nanoscale grains. This approach is demonstrated by solving a long-standing puzzle in the complex crystal structures of the orthorhombic, rhombohedral, and hexagonal polymorphs close to the Zr 2 Co 11 intermetallic compound. From our calculations, we identified the hard magnetic phase and the origin of high coercivity in this compound, thus guiding further development of these materials for use as high performance permanent magnets \u2026",
