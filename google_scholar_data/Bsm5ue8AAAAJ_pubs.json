            "Cancer is a complex disease with a range of genetic and biochemical markers within and among tumors, but a general tumor characteristic is extracellular acidity, which is associated with tumor growth and development. Acidosis could be a universal marker for cancer imaging and the delivery of therapeutic molecules, but its promise as a cancer biomarker has not been fully realized in the clinic. We have discovered a unique approach for the targeting of acidic tissue using the pH-sensitive folding and transmembrane insertion of pH (low) insertion peptide (pHLIP). The essence of the molecular mechanism has been elucidated, but the principles of design need to be understood for optimal clinical applications. Here, we report on a library of 16 rationally designed pHLIP variants. We show how the tuning of the biophysical properties of peptide\u2013lipid bilayer interactions alters tumor targeting, distribution in organs, and \u2026",

            "What are the molecular events that occur when a peptide inserts across a membrane or exits from it? Using the pH-triggered insertion of the pH low insertion peptide to enable kinetic analysis, we show that insertion occurs in several steps, with rapid (0.1 sec) interfacial helix formation, followed by a much slower (100 sec) insertion pathway to give a transmembrane helix. The reverse process of unfolding and peptide exit from the bilayer core, which can be induced by a rapid rise of the pH from acidic to basic, proceeds approximately 400 times faster than folding\/insertion and through different intermediate states. In the exit pathway, the helix\u2013coil transition is initiated while the polypeptide is still inside the membrane. The peptide starts to exit when about 30% of the helix is unfolded, and continues a rapid exit as it unfolds inside the membrane. These insights may guide understanding of membrane protein folding \u2026",

Here, we present the results of steady-state and kinetics investigations of several pHLIP variants with different numbers of charged residues, with attached polar cargoes at the peptide's membrane-inserting end, and with three single-Trp variants placed at the beginning, middle, and end of the transmembrane helix. Each pHLIP variant exhibits a pH-dependent interaction with a lipid bilayer. Although the number of protonatable residues at the inserting end does not affect the ultimate formation of helical structure across a membrane, it correlates with the time for peptide insertion, the number of intermediate states on the folding pathway, and the rates of unfolding and exit.

            "We have used pHLIP\u00ae [pH (low) insertion peptide] to study the roles of carboxyl groups in transmembrane (TM) peptide insertion. pHLIP binds to the surface of a lipid bilayer as a disordered peptide at neutral pH; when the pH is lowered, it inserts across the membrane to form a TM helix. Peptide insertion is reversed when the pH is raised above the characteristic pKa (6.0). A key event that facilitates membrane insertion is the protonation of aspartic acid (Asp) and\/or glutamic acid (Glu) residues, since their negatively charged side chains hinder membrane insertion at neutral pH. In order to gain mechanistic understanding, we studied the membrane insertion and exit of a series of pHLIP variants where the four Asp residues were sequentially mutated to nonacidic residues, including histidine (His). Our results show that the presence of His residues does not prevent the pH-dependent peptide membrane insertion at \u223c \u2026",

Here, we employed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate a wild-type (WT) pHLIP peptide oligomeric state in solution at high concentrations and monitor changes in the liposome structure upon peptide insertion into the bilayer. We established that even at high concentrations (up to 300 \u03bcM) the WT pHLIP peptide at pH 8.0 does not form oligomers larger than tetramers (which exhibit concentration-dependent transfer to the monomeric state, as was shown previously). This finding has significance for medical applications when high concentration of the peptide is injected into blood and diluted in blood circulation.
