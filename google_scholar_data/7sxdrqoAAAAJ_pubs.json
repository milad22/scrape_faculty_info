            "This paper presents a study of adsorption and vibrational features of folic acid, using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). A gold-capped silicon nanopillar (Au NP) with a height of 600 nm and a width of 120 nm was utilized to study the vibrational features of FA molecules adsorbed on the nanopillars within the high electromagnetic field areas. The adsorption behaviour of folic acid and the band assignment of the main vibrations together with the optimized geometry of folic acid and folic acid in the presence of a cluster of 10 gold atoms were assessed using the density functional theory (B3LYP(6\u201331G(d))) and the scalar relativistic effective core potential with a double-zeta basis set (LANL2DZ). The vibrations obtained from the solid-state folic acid and the folic acid on a gold cluster were in accordance with those observed experimentally. The analysis of the main vibrations indicated that the interaction of \u2026",

This paper presents a study of the adsorption of FA on silver\u2010capped silicon nanopillar substrates employing surface enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The experimentally observed vibrations from free FA and FA bound to the Ag surface display different vibrational spectra indicating chemical interaction of the molecule with the metal surface. Density functional theory calculations show that the Ag\u2013FA interaction is primarily through the nitrogen from the pteridine ring anchoring to the Ag metal surface. To investigate the Ag\u2013FA binding behavior further, the adsorption isotherm of FA on the silver\u2010capped silicon \u2026",

Subsequently, the conjugate was investigated by a computational hybrid method: our own N-layered Integrated Molecular Orbital and Molecular Mechanics (B3LYP(6\u201331G(d):UFF)). The results confirmed that the interaction occurred via hydrogen bonding between protons of the glutamic moiety from folic acid and \u03c0 electrons from the carbon nanotubes. The single-walled carbon nanotube-folic acid conjugate presented herein is believed to lead the way to new potential applications as carbon nanotube-based drug delivery systems.",

The Replacement Method (RM) variable subset selection technique based on Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR) proves to be successful for exploring 4885 molecular descriptors calculated with Dragon 6. The predictive capability of the obtained models is confirmed through an external test set of compounds, Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation and Y-Randomization.

With VEDA software vibrational frequencies were assigned in terms of the potential energy distribution. A detailed interpretation of the FT-IR, NMR and XRD, experimental and calculated, is reported. The HOMO and LUMO energy gap that reflects the chemical activity of the molecule were also studied by DFT and above basis set.
