On the other hand, the b quark mass generation is also a consequence of chiral U (3) Q\u00d7 U (3) d symmetry breaking. Therefore, in many models, there might be strong correlation between the b\u2192 s \u03b3 and b quark Yukawa coupling. In this Letter, we use non-decoupling MSSM model to illustrate this feature. In the scenario, the light Higgs boson may evade the direct search experiments at LEPII or Tevatron while the 125 GeV Higgs-like boson is identified as the heavy Higgs boson in the spectrum. A light charged Higgs is close to the heavy Higgs boson which is of 125 GeV and its contribution to b\u2192 s \u03b3 requires large supersymmetric correction with large PQ and R-symmetry breaking. The large supersymmetric contribution at the same time significantly modifies the b quark Yukawa coupling \u2026",

In this paper, we attempt to use the existing measurement of W-polarization in top quark decay to improve the distinction between stop and top quark states. We apply the ATLAS \u03c7 2 method of W-polarization measurement in semileptonic t t final state to semileptonic stop pair samples and study its prediction. We find that the faked top events from stop mostly contribute to the left-handed polarized W due to the reconstruction. The benchmark point with maximal contribution to top events only changes F L by 1%. After comparing with the current experiments, we conclude that the current measurement of W-polarization in t decay cannot exclude the light stop scenario.",

            "Recently, the Fermi-LAT Collaboration reported upper limits on the GeV gamma-ray flux from nearby clusters of galaxies. Motivated by these limits, we study corresponding constraints on gamma-ray emissions from two specific decaying dark matter models, one via grand unification scale suppressed operators and the other via R-parity violating operators. Both can account for the PAMELA and Fermi-LAT excesses of e\u00b1. For GUT decaying dark matter, the gamma-rays from the M49 and Fornax clusters, with energy in the range of 1 to 10 GeV, lead to the most stringent constraints to date. As a result, this dark matter is disfavored with conventional model of e\u00b1background. In addition, it is likely that some tension exists between the Fermi-LAT e\u00b1excess and the gamma-ray constraints for any decaying dark matter model, provided conventional model of e\u00b1background is adopted. Nevertheless, the GUT decaying \u2026",

We study the phenomenology of a supersymmetric scenario of light stau that predicts a 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson with enhanced di-photon decay through light stau loops. Since it is extremely challenging to search the Drell\u2013Yan stau pair at the LHC due to the small production rate, we focus on the parameter space with enhanced production of inclusive stau pairs, in particular, via b b\u00af fusion or gaugino pairs. We study its phenomenology in both pure leptonic tau \u03c4 \u2113\u00b1channels and hadronic tau tagged \u03c4 h channels.

An SU (5) singlet S is assumed to be the main component of dark matters, which decays into visible particles through dimension six operators suppressed by the grand unification scale. Under certain conditions, S decays dominantly into a pair of sleptons with universal coupling for all generations. Subsequently, electrons and positrons are produced from cascade decays of these sleptons. These cascade decay chains smooth the e++ e\u2212 spectrum, which permit naturally a good fit to the Fermi-LAT data. The observed positron fraction upturn by PAMELA can be reproduced simultaneously.
