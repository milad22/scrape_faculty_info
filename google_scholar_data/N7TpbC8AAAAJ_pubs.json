            "Common lore suggests that N-color QCD with massive quarks has no useful order parameters that can be nontrivial at zero baryon density. However, such order parameters do exist when there are n f quark flavors with a common mass and d\u2261 g c d (n f, N)> 1. These theories have a Z d color-flavor center symmetry arising from intertwined color center transformations and cyclic flavor permutations. The symmetry realization depends on the temperature, baryon chemical potential, and value of n f\/N, with implications for conformal window studies and dense quark matter.",

We show that a negative curvature at the origin of the potential, indicating instability of the plasma, is induced by a chiral asymmetry in electron Fermi energy, as opposed to number density, while the potential grows at large field value. It follows that the ground state for a plasma has zero magnetic helicity; a nonzero electron mass will allow an excited state of a plasma with nonzero helicity to relax to that ground state quickly. We conclude that a chiral plasma instability triggered by weak interactions is not a viable mechanism for explaining magnetic fields in stars except possibly when dynamics drives the system far from equilibrium.",

Such nonlocal topological features can distinguish phases whose realizations of global symmetries, as probed by local order parameters, are identical. If Z 3 braiding phases and angular momentum fractionalization are absent in lower density hadronic matter, as is widely expected, then the quark matter and hadronic matter regimes of dense QCD must be separated by at least one phase transition.",

At high isospin chemical potential and sufficiently low temperatures this theory becomes equivalent to a pure Yang\u2013Mills theory and accordingly has a first order deconfinement phase transition. Although this was conjectured in a seminal paper by Son and Stephanov in the year 2001, the critical temperature of this deconfinement phase transition was not computed. This paper computes the energy scale associated with this transition as a function of the chemical potential \u03bc I by relating the parameters of the equivalent Yang\u2013Mills theory to those of the underlying theory. We also relate the equation of state in one strongly interacting regime \u2026",

We construct a quasiparticle model of quarkyonic matter based on the constituent quark model, where the quark and nucleon masses are related by m Q= m N\/N c, and N c is the number of quark colors. The region of occupied states is for quarks k Q< k F\/N c and for nucleons k F< k N< k F+ \u0394. We first consider the general problem of quarkyonic matter with hard-core nucleon interactions. We then specialize to a quasiparticle model where the hard-core nucleon interactions are accounted for by an excluded volume. In this model, we show that the nucleonic shell forms past some critical density related to the hard-core size and for large densities becomes a thin shell. We explore the basic features of such a model and argue this model has the semiquantitative behavior needed \u2026",

With a particular choice of flavor-twisted boundary conditions, finite volume artifacts for flavor-singlet observables in a hypercubic spacetime volume are reduced to the size of finite volume artifacts in a spacetime volume with periodic boundary conditions that is four times larger.",
