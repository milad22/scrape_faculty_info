We account for the tight binding of Li+ ions to the PEO, the preferential solvation energy of anions in the PEO domain, the translational entropy of anions, and the ion-pair equilibrium between EO-complexed Li+ and anion. Our theory is able to predict many features observed in experiments, particularly the systematic dependence in the effective \u03c7 parameter on the size of the anions. Furthermore, comparison with the observed linear dependence in the effective \u03c7 on salt concentration yields an upper limit for the binding constant of the ion pair.",

With no adjustable parameters, we predict solvation energies in both single-component liquids and binary liquid mixtures that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Our study shows that the solvation energy of an ion is largely determined by the local response of the permanent and induced dipoles, as well as the local solvent composition in the case of mixtures, and does not simply correlate with the bulk dielectric constant. In particular, we show that, in a binary mixture, it is possible for the component with the lower bulk dielectric constant but larger molecular polarizability to be enriched near the ion.",

Taking poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene (PEO-b-PS) as an example, we show that in the presence of lithium salts the disordered-to-lamellar phase transition becomes first-order even at the level of mean-field theory, with a moderate range of temperature in which both the disordered and lamellar phases coexist, and different salt concentration in the coexisting phases. The coexistence arises from the different partitioning of the salt ions between the disordered phase and the lamellar phase, driven primarily by the solvation energy of anions. A striking consequence of the coexistence is that heating a lamellar phase into the coexistence region leads to increased order in the remaining lamellar phase.",

Structural changes that occur during the order-to-disorder transition (ODT) in a diblock copolymer\/salt mixture were characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In salt-free block copolymers, the ODT is sharp, and the domain size of the ordered phase decreases with increasing temperature. In contrast, the ODT of the diblock copolymer\/salt mixture examined here occurs gradually over an 11 \u00b0C temperature window, and the domain size of the ordered phase is a nonmonotonic function of temperature. We present an approach to estimate the fraction of the ordered phase in the 11 \u00b0C window where ordered and disordered phases coexist. The domain spacing of the ordered phase increases with increasing temperature in the coexistence window. Both findings are consistent with the selective partitioning of \u2026",

Combining the Flory\u2013Huggins theory with a statistical model accounting for the combinatorics in forming the cross-links and accounting for the charge neutrality due to the presence of anions, we find an entropic driving force that favors phase separation when the number of EO segments coordinating an Li+ ion exceeds 2. As a result of the asymmetric interaction between the ions and the two polymers, the phase diagram in the polymer composition becomes asymmetric upon addition of the lithium salts. In addition, we examine the effects of preferential solvation energy of the ions which has been shown previously to lead to an increase in the effective \u03c7 parameter between the two polymers.

We demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field near an ion reorganizes dipolar monomers, resulting in nonmonotonic changes in the volume fraction profile and the dielectric function of the polymers with respect to those of simple liquid mixtures.
