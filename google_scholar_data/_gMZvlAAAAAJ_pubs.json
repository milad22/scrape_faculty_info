            "Electron transport in conductors is usually well described by Fermi-liquid theory, which assumes that the energy states of the electrons near the Fermi level E F are not qualitatively altered by Coulomb interactions. In one-dimensional systems, however, even weak Coulomb interactions cause strong perturbations. The resulting system, known as a Luttinger liquid, is predicted to be distinctly different from its two-and three-dimensional counterparts 1. For example, tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid at energies near the Fermi level is predicted to be strongly suppressed, unlike in two-and three-dimensional metals. Experiments on one-dimensional semiconductor wires 2, 2, 3 have been interpreted by using Luttinger-liquid theory, but an unequivocal verification of the theoretical predictions has not yet been obtained. Similarly, the edge excitations seen in fractional quantum Hall conductors are consistent with Luttinger \u2026",

Recent additions include semiconductors with spin\u2013valley coupling 2, Ising superconductors 3, 4, 5 that can be tuned into a quantum metal 6, possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves 7, and topological semimetals with edge transport 8, 9.

In principle, this offers the possibility of switching on\/off and continuously tuning the magnetic moment and Berry curvature near the Dirac valleys by reversible electrical control 4, 5.

            "Controlling magnetism via electric fields addresses fundamental questions of magnetic phenomena and phase transitions 1, 2, 3, and enables the development of electrically coupled spintronic devices, such as voltage-controlled magnetic memories with low operation energy 4, 5, 6. Previous studies on dilute magnetic semiconductors such as (Ga, Mn) As and (In, Mn) Sb have demonstrated large modulations of the Curie temperatures and coercive fields by altering the magnetic anisotropy and exchange interaction 2, 4, 7, 8, 9. Owing to their unique magnetic properties 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, the recently reported two-dimensional magnets provide a new system for studying these features 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. For instance, a bilayer of chromium triiodide (CrI 3) behaves as a layered antiferromagnet with a magnetic field-driven metamagnetic transition 15, 16. Here, we demonstrate electrostatic gate control of magnetism in \u2026",
