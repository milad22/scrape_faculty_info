            "The first appearance of explicitly symbolic objects in the archaeological record marks a fundamental stage in the emergence of modern social behavior in Homo. Ornaments such as shell beads represent some of the earliest objects of this kind. We report on examples of perforated Nassarius gibbosulus shell beads from Grotte des Pigeons (Taforalt, Morocco), North Africa. These marine shells come from archaeological levels dated by luminescence and uranium-series techniques to \u224882,000 years ago. They confirm evidence of similar ornaments from other less well dated sites in North Africa and adjacent areas of southwest Asia. The shells are of the same genus as shell beads from slightly younger levels at Blombos Cave in South Africa. Wear patterns on the shells imply that some of them were suspended, and, as at Blombos, they were covered in red ochre. These findings imply an early distribution of bead \u2026",

Vanguard Cave provides evidence of marine food supply (mollusks, seal, dolphin, and fish). Further evidence of marine mammal remains was also found in the occupation levels at Gorham9s Cave associated with Upper Paleolithic and Mousterian technologies [Finlayson C, et al.

            "Optical dating of sediment using optically stimulated luminescence has become important for studying Earth surface processes, and this technique continues to develop rapidly. A group of closely linked luminescence methods can be used to estimate the time since grains of quartz and feldspar were last exposed to daylight by detecting their subsequent response to environmental ionizing radiation exposure. The technique is well suited to the dating of deposits as young as one year to several hundred thousand years. Recent technical developments have established a dating protocol with improved precision, a high degree of reliability, and an in-built means to detect incomplete signal removal during deposition. This approach has been extended to age estimation for single grains, opening up a wider range of potential environments and new possibilities for understanding postdepositional grain movement \u2026",

In this dating technique the age-dependent population of trapped electrons is measured by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) rather than by thermoluminescence (TL). Hence only light-sensitive traps are sampled. This is particularly advantageous for unburnt sediment because of the reliance for zero setting on exposure to sunlight prior to deposition. For OSL this is accomplished in a matter of minutes whereas for TL there is often a substantial residual, particularly in the case of quartz, even after twenty four hours or so. The difficulties which arise are discussed, and some promising results presented.",

The evidence suggests that optical stimulation evicts charge from traps in the crystal lattice associated with the 325\u00b0C thermoluminescence (TL) emission and elevates it to the conduction band. Part of the charge recombines with luminescence centres to produce the observed optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and a significant portion is re-trapped at the same or different localities in the lattice.

            "Optically stimulated luminescence dating of Late Quaternary glaciogenic sediments was undertaken in critical areas of the Himalayas of northern Pakistan in order to examine the timing of glaciation. The dates demonstrate that several glaciations occurred during the last glacial cycle. In Swat, the Grabral 2 Stade and the Kalam I Stade were dated at ca. 77 ka and ca. 38 ka, respectively. The error on the former date is large and it is conceivable that the moraines may have formed during the early part of Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 rather than during Oxygen Isotope Stage 4. The Kalam I Stade, however, clearly represents a glaciation during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3. The oldest moraines and those at the lowest altitude in the Indus valley at Shatial have an age of ca. 60 ka. These also relate to a major glacial advance during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3.

            "Moraines south of Mount Everest in the Khumbu Himal were dated using optically stimulated luminescence. Clustering of ages and morphostratigraphy allowed three advances to be dated: (1) the Periche Glacial Stage (ca. 18\u201325 ka), (2) the Chhukung Glacial Stage (ca. 10 ka), and (3) the Lobuche Stage (ca. 1\u20132 ka). The Periche Stage is coincident with Oxygen Isotope Stage 2; the Chhukung Stage represents a late glacial or early Holocene glacial advance; and the Lobuche Stage is a late Holocene glacial advance that predates the Little Ice Age.",
