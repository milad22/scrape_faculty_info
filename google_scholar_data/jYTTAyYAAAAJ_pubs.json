            "We have studied the magnetotransport properties of a new metallic granular Co-Ag system. The spin-dependent electron scattering is revealed in the forms of a giant magnetoresistance and an extraordinary Hall effect, both of which are found to be strongly dependent on the Co particle size and the electron mean free path. The experimental correlation \u03c1 x y\u221d \u03c1 x x 3.7 uncovered is unexpected from existing theories. Interfacial scatterings of intermediate range are required in order to account for the anomalous magnetotransport in this magnetic granular system.",
