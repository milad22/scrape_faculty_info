            "We discuss theoretical and phenomenological aspects of two-Higgs-doublet extensions of the Standard Model. In general, these extensions have scalar mediated flavour changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by experiment. Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing scalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In particular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated, including the so-called type I and type II models as well as lepton-specific and inert models. Type III models are then discussed, where scalar flavour changing neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by either a specific ansatz for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of family symmetries leading to a natural suppression mechanism. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in these models. Next we turn to the role of \u2026",

            "In electroweak models, radiative corrections to the scalar potential can have significant consequences. In the standard model, they can destabilize the standard model vacuum; the requirement of vacuum stability leads to severe bounds on Higgs and fermion masses. In supersymmetric models, they lead to the generation of the electroweak scale in terms of the unification scale. In this Report, the method of calculating radiative corrections to the scalar potentials is reviewed, with an emphasis on renormalization group improvement of the potential. Finite temperature corrections to the potential, calculation of tunneling rates and the nature of cosmological phase transitions are then discussed, and the results are then applied to the standard model to derive stringent bounds on Higgs and fermion passes. These results are then generalized to models with several Higgs fields. Finally, the scalar potential in \u2026",

It is shown that, if the basic Yukawa coupling matrices are of the Fritzsch form or some generalizations thereof (two such examples are presented), then the neutral flavor-changing couplings have a hierarchical structure given by \u0394 ij\u221a m i m j, where \u0394 ij is a combination of mixing angles and the m i\u2019s are the relevant fermion masses. These couplings give a lower bound of the order of \u0394 ds times 1 TeV on the mass of the exchanged scalar from the neutral-kaon mass difference. If the Higgs-boson mass is not significantly greater than this limit, one expects DD mixing comparable to the present experimental bound.",
