            "This White Paper presents the science case of an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), focused on the structure and interactions of gluon-dominated matter, with the intent to articulate it to the broader nuclear science community. It was commissioned by the managements of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) with the objective of presenting a summary of scientific opportunities and goals of the EIC as a follow-up to the 2007 NSAC Long Range plan. This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics over the past decades and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on \u201cGluons and quark sea at high energies\u201d at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required \u2026",

The asymmetry A 2 was measured and found to be significantly smaller than the positivity limit R for both proton and deuteron targets. A 2 p is found to be positive and inconsistent with zero.

The systematic decomposition of the transverse and longitudinal response functions has been obtained by means of a Rosenbluth-type analysis of the data in the momentum transfer interval 200 MeV\/c\/s| q|\/s 600 MeV\/c. A comparison with theoretical calculations which extend over the quasielastic and \u0394-peak regions is presented. A reduction of the differences between our data and theory seems obtainable through the introduction of meson-exchange currents, resonant and non-resonant meson production, and the use of the shell model. Our experimental Coulomb sum-rule estimates at higher| q| agree with independent particle model predictions. We compare our results in the vicinity of the \u0394-peak with the total absorption cross section for real photons.",

A variety of Cherenkov counters, scintillators and lead-glass calorimeters provide excellent particle identification.
