            "The Swift mission, scheduled for launch in 2004, is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma\u2010ray burst (GRB) astronomy. It is a first\u2010of\u2010its\u2010kind autonomous rapid\u2010slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid\u2010reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr\u22121 and performing detailed X\u2010ray and UV\/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to  . The mission is being developed by a NASA\u2010led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new\u2010generation wide\u2010field gamma\u2010ray (15\u2013150 keV \u2026",

The flux at optical, X-ray, and other long wavelengths decays as a power of time, and the initial value of the flux or magnitude, as well as the value of the time-decay exponent, should help to distinguish between possible types of dissipative fireball models.",

This is, however, long compared with the dynamical timescale of a compact stellar-mass object ( seconds). Energy is assumed to be released as an outflow with high mean lorentz factor . But a compact stellar-mass collapse or merger is, realistically, likely to generate a mass (or energy) flux that is unsteady on some timescales in the range -10 seconds. If  fluctuates by a factor of  around its mean value, relative motions within the outflowing material will themselves (in the comoving frame) be relativistic, and can give rise to internal shocks.

Some interesting features are emerging, including a distinct rapidly decaying component preceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources, a shallow decay component before the more \u201cnormal\u201d decay component observed in a good fraction of GRBs, and X\u2010ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows. In this paper we systematically analyze the possible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X\u2010ray afterglow light curves and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest that the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the prompt gamma\u2010ray bursts and\/or the X\u2010ray flares. This provides strong evidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are likely two distinct components \u2026",

            "Although the link between long \u03b3-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae has been established 1, 2, 3, 4, hitherto there have been no observations of the beginning of a supernova explosion and its intimate link to a GRB. In particular, we do not know how the jet that defines a \u03b3-ray burst emerges from the star's surface, nor how a GRB progenitor explodes. Here we report observations of the relatively nearby GRB 060218 (ref. 5) and its connection to supernova SN 2006aj (ref. 6). In addition to the classical non-thermal emission, GRB 060218 shows a thermal component in its X-ray spectrum, which cools and shifts into the optical\/ultraviolet band as time passes. We interpret these features as arising from the break-out of a shock wave driven by a mildly relativistic shell into the dense wind surrounding the progenitor 7. We have caught a supernova in the act of exploding, directly observing the shock break-out, which \u2026",
