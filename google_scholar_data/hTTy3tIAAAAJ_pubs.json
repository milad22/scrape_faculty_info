The generalized parton distribution H is related to impact parameter distribution of unpolarized quarks for an unpolarized nucleon,   is related to the distribution of longitudinally polarized quarks in a longitudinally polarized nucleon, and E is related to the distortion of the unpolarized quark distribution in the transverse plane when the nucleon has transverse polarization.

The distortion of chirally odd impact parameter dependent parton distributions is related to chirally odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs). This result is used to provide a decomposition of the quark angular momentum with respect to (wrt) quarks of definite transversity. Chirally odd GPDs can thus be used to determine the correlation between quark spin and quark angular momentum in unpolarized nucleons.

            "Recently, it has been pointed out that there exists a connection between the generalized parton distribution E (x, 0, t) and the Sivers effect for single-spin asymmetries. For transversely polarized nucleon targets, generalized parton distributions are asymmetric in impact parameter space. This impact parameter space asymmetry, together with the final state interaction of the active quark, gives rise to the Sivers effect in momentum space. We demonstrate this phenomenon explicitly in the scalar diquark model. This result also illustrates the physics that underlies the correlation between the anomalous magnetic moment and the Sivers effect for a given quark flavor.",
