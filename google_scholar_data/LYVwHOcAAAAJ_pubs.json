            "This paper addresses two important issues on stochastic models of chemical kinetic systems with disparate rates, namely, effective models over the slow time scale and efficient simulation algorithms. These issues have received a great deal of attention in recent years, and much progress has been made. 1\u20135 One main idea, pursued by many authors, 2, 4, 5 is to make a quasiequilibrium approximation for the fast processes and solve the empirically averaged slow processes. Even though this has been a common theme in much of the recent works on this subject, it seems that the key issue of identifying the effective process and effective variables over different time scales has not been fully understood. As a result, the validity and generality of these approaches have not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The present paper has two purposes. The first is to provide effective models and effective variables for stochastic chemical kinetic systems with disparate rates. Compared with previous works, such as Refs. 4 and 5 which rely on the identification of slow and fast species, our work gives a general prescription for identifying effective slow variables. As we will see later, in general the slow variables are not associated with specific species, but are rather combinations of the molecular numbers of several species. The second purpose of this paper is to suggest an efficient stochastic simulation algorithm for systems with disparate rates in the style of the well-known Gillespie algorithm. 6, 7 What should be noted is the simplicity of this algorithm, it is completely seamless. Even though understanding the effective dynamics on the slow time scale requires \u2026",

This algorithm is an improvement of the traditional stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), also known as Gillespie\u2019s algorithm. It is in the form of a nested SSA and uses an outer SSA to simulate the slow reactions with rates computed from realizations of inner SSAs that simulate the fast reactions. The algorithm itself is quite general and seamless, and it amounts to a small modification of the original SSA. Our analysis of such multi-scale chemical kinetic systems allows us to identify the slow variables in the system, derive effective dynamics on the slow time scale, and provide error estimates for the nested SSA. Efficiency of the nested SSA is discussed using these error estimates, and illustrated through several numerical examples.",
