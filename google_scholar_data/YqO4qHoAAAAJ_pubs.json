            "Exoplanet detections have revolutionized astronomy, offering new insights into solar system architecture and planet demographics. While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed 1, none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings 2, 3, 4 best explained by the influence of accreting planets 5, are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries 6, 7 or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful 10. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009\u20132015, we infer the presence of \u2026",

            "We analyze the multi-frequency behavior of the quasar 3C 454.3 during three prominent \u03b3-ray outbursts: 2009 Autumn, 2010 Spring, and 2010 Autumn. The data reveal a repeating pattern, including a triple flare structure, in the properties of each \u03b3-ray outburst, which implies similar mechanism (s) and location for all three events. The multi-frequency behavior indicates that the lower frequency events are co-spatial with the \u03b3-ray outbursts, although the \u03b3-ray emission varies on the shortest timescales. We determine that the variability from UV to IR wavelengths during an outburst results from a single synchrotron component whose properties do not change significantly over the different outbursts. Despite a general increase in the degree of optical linear polarization during an outburst, the polarization drops significantly at the peak of the \u03b3-ray event, which suggests that both shocks and turbulent processes are involved \u2026",

We present for the first time the multi-wavelength AGILE, Swift, INTEGRAL, and GASP-WEBT data collected in order to explain the extraordinary \u03b3-ray flare of 3C 454.3 which occurred in 2010 November.

This first airborne occultation observation since 1995 with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory resulted in the best occultation chords recorded for the event, in three visible wavelength bands. The data obtained from SOFIA are combined with chords obtained from the ground at the IRTF, the US Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, and Leeward Community College to give the detailed state of the Pluto-Charon system at the time of the event with a focus on Pluto's atmosphere. The data show a return to the distinct upper and lower atmospheric regions with a knee or kink in the light curve separating them as was observed in 1988, rather than the smoothly transitioning bowl-shaped light curves of recent years \u2026",

Radio continuum and recombination line observations of this source revealed a sub-arcsecond bipolar outflow surrounding an~ 100 mas circumstellar disk. Follow-up infrared studies detected the disk, and suggested that it may have skew and an inner clearing. Our new infrared interferometric observations, which have more than twice the resolution of previously published data sets, support the presence of both skew and a compact infrared excess. They rule out inner clearings with radii greater than~ 14 mas. We show the improvements in disk parameter \u2026",

The high contrast imaging technique of non-redundant masking is well posed to detect planetary mass companions at several to tens of AU in nearby transition disks. We present non-redundant masking observations of the T Cha and LkCa 15 transition disks, both of which host posited sub-stellar mass companions. However, due to a loss of information intrinsic to the technique, observations of extended sources (e.g. scattered light from disks) can be misinterpreted as moving companions. We discuss tests to distinguish between these two scenarios, with applications to the T Cha and LkCa 15 observations. We argue that a static, forward-scattering disk can explain the T Cha data, while LkCa 15 is best explained by multiple orbiting companions.",

This instrument is well suited to address major questions in the formation and evolution of planetary systems that will be relevant in the extremely large telescope (ELT) era, as recently examined in the NASEM Exoplanet Science Strategy report. Addressing these questions relies on our leveraging of the diffraction-limited resolution and light-gathering power of TMT, both of which will enable us to directly study gaseous, icy, and rocky planets at a range of effective temperatures. A design goal is to enable the detection of biomarkers in the atmosphere of planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars.

The dominant techniques to detect and characterize giant planets $-$ radial velocities, transits, direct imaging, microlensing, and astrometry $-$ are each isolated to a limited range of planet masses, separations, ages, and temperatures. These windows into the arrangement and physical properties of giant planets have spawned new questions about the timescale and location of their assembly; the distributions of planet mass and orbital separation at young and old ages; the composition and structure of their atmospheres; and their orbital and rotational angular momentum architectures. The ELTs will address these questions by building bridges between these islands of mass, orbital distance, and age. The angular resolution, collecting area, all-sky coverage, and novel instrumentation suite of these facilities are needed to provide a complete map of the orbits and atmospheric evolution of gas giant planets (0.3$-$10 $ M_\\mathrm {Jup} $) across space (0.1$-$100 AU) and time (1 Myr to 10 Gyr). This white paper highlights the scientific potential of the GMT and TMT to address these outstanding questions, with a particular focus on the role of direct imaging and spectroscopy of large samples of giant planets that will soon be made available with $ Gaia $.",

            "The limitations of adaptive optics and coronagraph performance make exoplanet detection close to \u03bb\u2009\u2009\/\u2009\u2009D extremely difficult with conventional imaging methods. The technique of nonredundant masking (NRM), which turns a filled aperture into an interferometric array, has pushed the planet detection parameter space to within \u03bb\u2009\u2009\/\u2009\u2009D. For high Strehl, the related filled-aperture kernel phase technique can achieve resolution comparable to NRM, without the associated dramatic decrease in throughput. We present NRM and kernel phase contrast curves generated for ground- and space-based instruments. We use both real and simulated observations to assess the performance of each technique, and discuss their capabilities for different exoplanet science goals such as broadband detection and spectral characterization.",
