            "The optical response of semiconducting monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is dominated by strongly bound excitons that are stable even at room temperature. However, substrate-related effects such as screening and disorder in currently available specimens mask many anticipated physical phenomena and limit device applications of TMDCs. Here, we demonstrate that that these undesirable effects are strongly suppressed in suspended devices. Extremely robust (photogain> 1,000) and fast (response time< 1 ms) photoresponse allow us to study, for the first time, the formation, binding energies and dissociation mechanisms of excitons in TMDCs through photocurrent spectroscopy. By analyzing the spectral positions of peaks in the photocurrent and by comparing them with first-principles calculations, we obtain binding energies, band gaps and spin-orbit splitting in monolayer TMDCs.

            "We investigate electrical gating of photoluminescence and optical absorption in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) configured in field effect transistor geometry. We observe a hundredfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an increase in absorption at \u223c660 nm in these devices when an external gate voltage is decreased from +50 to \u221250 V, while the photoluminescence wavelength remains nearly constant. In contrast, in bilayer MoS2 devices we observe almost no changes in photoluminescence with gate voltage. We propose that the differing responses of the monolayer and bilayer devices are related to the interaction of the excitons in MoS2 with charge carriers.",
