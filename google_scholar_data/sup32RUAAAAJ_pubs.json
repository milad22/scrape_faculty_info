            "The work described in this paper is part of a comprehensive research effort aimed at eliminating the occurrence of low pressure turbine blade flutter in aircraft engines. The results of fundamental unsteady aerodynamic experiments conducted in an annular cascade are studied in order to improve the overall understanding of the flutter mechanism and to identify the key flutter parameters. In addition to the standard traveling wave tests, several other unique experiments are described. The influence coefficient technique is experimentally verified for this class of blades. The beneficial stabilizing effect of mistuning is also directly demonstrated. Finally, the key design parameters for flutter in low pressure turbine blades are identified. In addition to the experimental effort, correlating analyses utilizing linearized Euler methods demonstrate that these computational techniques are adequate to predict turbine flutter.
