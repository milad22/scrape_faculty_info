            "Recent theory and experiment have revealed that strong spin\u2013orbit coupling can have marked qualitative effects on the band structure of weakly interacting solids, leading to a distinct phase of matter, the topological band insulator. We show that spin\u2013orbit interaction also has quantitative and qualitative effects on the correlation-driven Mott insulator transition. Taking Ir-based pyrochlores as a specific example, we predict that for weak electron\u2013electron interaction Ir electrons are in metallic and topological band insulator phases at weak and strong spin\u2013orbit interaction, respectively. We show that by increasing the electron\u2013electron interaction strength, the effects of spin\u2013orbit coupling are enhanced. With increasing interactions, the topological band insulator is transformed into a \u2018topological Mott insulator\u2019phase having gapless surface spin-only excitations. The proposed phase diagram also includes a region of \u2026",

We argue that this pumping is measurable via nonlocal transport experiments, in the limit of weak internode scattering. Specifically, we show that as a consequence of the anomaly, applying a local magnetic field parallel to an injected current induces a valley imbalance that diffuses over long distances. A probe magnetic field can then convert this imbalance into a measurable voltage drop far from source and drain. Such nonlocal transport vanishes when the \u2026",

Interactions of an ensemble of adatoms are frustrated, as the RKKY-type interactions of two adatom spins depend on the directions of spins relative to the vector connecting them. We show that at low temperatures the frustrated RKKY interactions give rise to two phases: an ordered ferromagnetic phase with spins pointing perpendicular to the surface, and a disordered spin-glass-like phase. The two phases are separated by a quantum phase transition driven by the magnetic exchange anisotropy. The ordered phase breaks time-reversal symmetry spontaneously, driving the surface states into a gapped state, which exhibits an anomalous quantum Hall effect and provides a realization of the parity anomaly.

We show that it is the orbital magnetic moment of quasiparticles that is responsible for the natural optical activity, and thus the chiral magnetic effect. While for purely static magnetic fields the chiral magnetic effect is known to have a topological origin and to be related to the presence of Berry curvature monopoles (Weyl points) in the band structure, we show that the existence of Berry monopoles is not required for the dynamic chiral magnetic effect to appear; the latter is thus not unique to Weyl metals.

Using a self-consistent treatment of dynamic screening of Coulomb interactions in the gapped phase, we show that the excitonic gap can reach values on the order of the Fermi energy at strong interactions. The gap is discontinuous as a function of interlayer separation and effective fine structure constant, revealing a first-order phase transition between effectively incoherent and interlayer coherent phases. To achieve the regime of strong coherence, the interlayer separation must be smaller than the Fermi wavelength, and the extrinsic screening of the medium embedding the Dirac layers must be negligible.

Here we consider the effect of the Coulomb interactions in strained graphene with a uniform pseudomagnetic field.
