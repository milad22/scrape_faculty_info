            "Dielectric loss from two-level states is shown to be a dominant decoherence source in superconducting quantum bits. Depending on the qubit design, dielectric loss from insulating materials or the tunnel junction can lead to short coherence times. We show that a variety of microwave and qubit measurements are well modeled by loss from resonant absorption of two-level defects. Our results demonstrate that this loss can be significantly reduced by using better dielectrics and fabricating junctions of small area\u2272 10 \u03bc m 2. With a redesigned phase qubit employing low-loss dielectrics, the energy relaxation rate has been improved by a factor of 20, opening up the possibility of multiqubit gates and algorithms.",

            "A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair, t tH, is presented. The analysis uses 20.3 fb\u2212 1 of pp collision data at\u221a s= 8 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2012. The search is designed for the H\u2192 b b decay mode and uses events containing one or two electrons or muons. In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, events are categorised according to their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities. A neural network is used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by t t+ jets production. In the single-lepton channel, variables calculated using a matrix element method are included as inputs to the neural network to improve discrimination of the irreducible t t+b b background. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found and an observed (expected) limit of 3.4 (2.2) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained at 95% confidence level. The ratio of the measured t tH signal cross section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be \u03bc= 1. 5\u00b11. 1 assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.",

We have used simultaneous single-shot measurement of coupled Josephson phase qubits to directly probe interaction of the qubits in the time domain. The concept of measurement crosstalk is introduced, and we show that its effects are minimized by careful adjustment of the timing of the measurements. We observe the antiphase oscillation of the two-qubit |01> and |10> states, consistent with quantum mechanical entanglement of these states, thereby opening the possibility for full characterization of multiqubit gates and elementary quantum algorithms.",

In the superconducting state, the photoemission peak intensity as a function of doping scales with the superfluid density and the condensation energy. As a function of temperature, the peak intensity shows an abrupt behavior near the superconducting phase transition temperature where phase coherence sets in, rather than near the temperature where the gap opens.

            "The three dimensional topological insulator bismuth selenide (Bi 2 Se 3) is expected to possess strong spin-orbit coupling and spin-textured topological surface states and, thus, exhibit a high charge to spin current conversion efficiency. We evaluate spin-orbit torques in Bi 2 Se 3\/Co 40 Fe 40 B 20 devices at different temperatures by spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements. As the temperature decreases, the spin-orbit torque ratio increases from\u223c 0. 047 at 300 K to\u223c 0. 42 below 50 K. Moreover, we observe a significant out-of-plane torque at low temperatures. Detailed analysis indicates that the origin of the observed spin-orbit torques is topological surface states in Bi 2 Se 3. Our results suggest that topological insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling could be promising candidates as highly efficient spin current sources for exploring the next generation of spintronic applications.",
