Moreover, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Nras illuminated motile, peri-Golgi vesicles, and prolonged BFA treatment blocked PM expression. GFP-Hras colocalized with GFP-Nras, but GFP-Kras4B revealed less Golgi and no vesicular fluorescence. Whereas a secondary membrane targeting signal was required for PM expression, the CAAX motif alone was necessary and sufficient to target proteins to the endomembrane where they were methylated, a modification required for efficient membrane association. Thus, prenylated CAAX proteins do not associate directly with the PM but instead associate with the endomembrane and are subsequently transported to the PM, a process that requires a secondary targeting motif.",

We also demonstrate that H-Ras that is restricted to the ER can activate the Erk pathway and transform fibroblasts, and that Ras localized on different membrane compartments differentially engages various signalling pathways.

By contrast, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of RAS proteins direct them to various cellular membranes and, in some cases, modulate GTP\u2013GDP exchange. Important RAS PTMs include the constitutive and irreversible remodelling of its carboxy-terminal CAAX motif by farnesylation, proteolysis and methylation, reversible palmitoylation, and conditional modifications, including phosphorylation, peptidyl-prolyl isomerisation, monoubiquitylation, diubiquitylation, nitrosylation, ADP ribosylation and glucosylation.",

Here we show that, in response to Src-dependent activation of phospholipase C\u03b31, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 translocated to the Golgi where it activated Ras. Whereas Ca 2+ positively regulated Ras on the Golgi apparatus through RasGRP1, the same second messenger negatively regulated Ras on the plasma membrane by means of the Ras GTPase-activating protein CAPRI 3. Ras activation after T-cell receptor stimulation in Jurkat cells, rich in RasGRP1, was limited to the Golgi apparatus through the action of CAPRI, demonstrating unambiguously a physiological role for Ras on Golgi \u2026",

Additional Shp2 functions downstream of, or parallel to, Ras\/Erk activation also are proposed. Here, we show that Shp2 promotes Src family kinase (SFK) activation by regulating the phosphorylation of the Csk regulator PAG\/Cbp, thereby controlling Csk access to SFKs. In Shp2-deficient cells, SFK inhibitory C-terminal tyrosines are hyperphosphorylated, and the tyrosyl phosphorylation of multiple SFK substrates, including Plc\u03b31, is decreased. Decreased Plc\u03b31 phosphorylation leads to defective Ras activation on endomembranes, and may help account for impaired Erk activation in Shp2-deficient cells. Decreased \u2026",

            "We have recently demonstrated that human neutrophils (PMN) possess two different classes of adenosine receptors (A1 and A2) that, when occupied, promote chemotaxis and inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species (e.g., O2- and H2O2), respectively. We have previously demonstrated that adenosine protects endothelial cells (EC) from injury by stimulated neutrophils (PMN) both by diminishing generation of H2O2 and inhibiting adherence of PMN to EC. We therefore determined whether occupancy of A1 or A2 adenosine receptors regulated adherence of PMN to EC. At concentrations similar to those required to inhibit release of O2- by ligation of A2 receptors, both adenosine (IC50 = 56 nM) and 59N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, IC50 = 8 nM), the most potent A2 agonist, inhibited adherence to EC by stimulated PMN (FMLP, 0.1 microM). In direct contrast, the specific A1 agonists N6 \u2026",

            "Prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (pcCMT) is the third of three enzymes that posttranslationally modify C-terminal CAAX motifs and thereby target CAAX proteins to the plasma membrane. Here we report the molecular characterization and subcellular localization of the first mammalian (human myeloid) pcCMT. The deduced amino acid sequence of mammalian pcCMT predicts a multiple membrane-spanning protein with homologies to the yeast pcCMT, STE14 , and the mammalian band 3 anion transporter. The human gene complemented a ste14 mutant. pcCMT mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. An anti-pcCMT antiserum detected a 33-kDa protein in myeloid cell membranes. Ectopically expressed recombinant pcCMT had enzymatic activity identical to that observed in neutrophil membranes. Mammalian pcCMT was not expressed at the plasma membrane but rather restricted to the \u2026",
