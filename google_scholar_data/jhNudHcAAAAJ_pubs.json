            "This paper discusses some of the forms and consequences of HIV\u2010related stigma in a community living in KTC, an informal settlement in South Africa, drawing on ethnographic research findings. The first section presents a dynamic form of stigma sign language that is used to label the HIV\u2010positive \u2018other\u2019 in this community. The second section highlights some of the pernicious consequences of HIV\u2010related stigma, including fear of disclosure and downward social mobility, and the way in which these prompt some HIV\u2010positive people to avoid local clinics and treatment altogether, and drive others to mask or hide the fact that they are receiving medical treatment, such as antiretroviral drugs.
