The predominating factor in determining the morphology (spheres, triangular prisms, and rods) was the solvent, selected on the basis of coordinating power. The nanoparticles were structurally analyzed, and the photoluminescence of each shape was compared. The intensity of the green band emission, common to many ZnO structures, was found to vary with morphology. The strongest green band intensity corresponded to the shape with the largest surface\/volume ratio and could be attributed to surface oxygen vacancies. Control over the morphology of ZnO at the nanoscale is presented as a means to control the green band emission. ",

It is found that the green photoluminescence (PL) of samples from the mixture of TOA\/OD and TOPO\/OD is largely suppressed compared with that from pure OD. Moreover, it is found that all spherical nanoparticles have positive zeta potential, and spherical nanoparticles from TOA\/OD and TOPO\/OD have a smaller zeta potential than those from OD. A plausible explanation is that oxygen vacancies, presumably located near the surface, contribute to the green PL, and the introduction of TOA and TOPO will reduce the density of oxygen vacancies near the surfaces.

The PL from each sample is very similar to the PL from bulk Zn-Se-Te solutions at low Te concentrations. The PL from the single-\u03b4-doped material shows emission relatively close to the band edge which we attribute partly to Te 2 clusters (nearest-neighbor pairs) and partly to non-nearest pairs. This PL changes with storage time, from which we conclude that the nearest-neighbor pairs are more stable than non-nearest-neighbor pairs.

            "The tunability of electronic and optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) has been an important subject in nanotechnology. While control of the emission property of QDs in wavelength has been studied extensively, control of the emission lifetime of QDs has not been explored in depth. In this report, ZnO-CdS core\u2212shell QDs were synthesized in a two-step process, in which we initially synthesized ZnO core particles, and then stepwise slow growth of CdS shells followed. The coating of a CdS shell on a ZnO core increased the exciton lifetime more than 100 times that of the core ZnO QD, and the lifetime was further extended as the thickness of shell increased. This long electron\u2212hole recombination lifetime is due to a unique staggered band alignment between the ZnO core and CdS shell, so-called type II band alignment, where the carrier excitation holes and electrons are spatially \u2026",
