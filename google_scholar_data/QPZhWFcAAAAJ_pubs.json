In degenerate conditions of the electron gas, the pressure transverse to the magnetic field B may vanish, leading to a transverse collapse. For W bosons an instability arises because the magnetization diverges at the critical field B c= M W 2\/e. If the magnetic field is self-consistently maintained, the maximum value it can take is of the order of 2 B c\/3, but in any case the system becomes unstable and collapses.",
