            "The successive discoveries of fullerenes1 and carbon nanotubes2 (CNTs) around 1990 triggered a hot wave of scientific research to explore the properties and applications of these new forms of carbonous materials over the past two decades. Figure 1 shows schematically the research area centered at fullerene C60. Differing from the two long-known allotropes of carbon, ie, diamond and graphite, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes have displayed brand-new, unique, and fascinating structural, electronic, electric, mechanic, and optical properties and should find their power in a wide variety of applications. 3, 4 Some of their unique properties can be related to the curved \u03c0-conjugation within their curved hexagonal (for CNTs) or hybrid hexagon-pentagon (for fullerenes) carbon-carbon networks. The curved \u03c0-conjugation and aromaticity, as well as the related chemistry, of fullerene [60] and its larger homologues \u2026",

However, this protocol is not atom-economic as the reaction produces a stoichiometric amount of pyridine or quinoline waste, the cleaved part of the N\u2013O or N\u2013N bonds. In this article, we disclose an unprecedented gold-catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition between ynamides and isoxazoles, allowing rapid and practical access to a wide range of synthetically-useful 2-aminopyrroles. Most importantly, mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that this reaction presumably proceeds via an \u03b1-imino gold carbene pathway, thus providing a strategically novel, atom-economic route to the generation of gold carbenes. Other significant features of this approach include the use of readily-available \u2026",

The combination of their destabilizing features hinders attempts to prepare molecules such as pentalyne, an 8\u03c0-electron anti-aromatic bicycle with extremely high ring strain. Here we describe the facile synthesis of osmapentalyne derivatives that are thermally viable, despite containing the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne carbon. The compounds are characterized using X-ray crystallography, and their computed energies and magnetic properties reveal aromatic character. Hence, the incorporation of the osmium centre not only reduces the ring strain of the parent pentalyne, but also converts its H\u00fcckel anti-aromaticity into Craig-type M\u00f6bius aromaticity in the metallapentalynes. The concept of aromaticity is thus extended to five-membered rings containing a metal\u2013carbon triple bond \u2026",
