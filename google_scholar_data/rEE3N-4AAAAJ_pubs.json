            "We review the effective field theories (EFTs) developed for few-nucleon systems. These EFTs are controlled expansions in momenta, where certain (leading-order) interactions are summed to all orders. At low energies, an EFT with only contact interactions allows a detailed analysis of renormalization in a nonperturbative context and uncovers novel asymptotic behavior. Manifestly model-independent calculations can be carried out to high orders, leading to high precision. At higher energies, an EFT that includes pion fields justifies and extends the traditional framework of phenomenological potentials. The correct treatment of QCD symmetries ensures a connection with lattice QCD. Several tests and prospects of these EFTs are discussed.",

            "We propose a method for the lattice QCD computation of nucleon\u2013nucleon low-energy interactions. It consists in simulating QCD in the background of a \u201celectromagnetic\u201d field whose potential is non-vanishing, but whose field strength is zero. By tuning the background field, phase-shifts at any (but small) momenta can be determined by measuring the shift of the ground state energy. Lattice sizes as small as 5 Fermi can be sufficient for the calculation of phase shifts up to momenta of order of m\u03c0\/2.",

            "The two-nucleon sector is near an infrared fixed point of QCD and as a result the S-wave scattering lengths are unnaturally large compared to the effective ranges and shape parameters. It is usually assumed that a lattice QCD simulation of the two-nucleon sector will require a lattice that is much larger than the scattering lengths in order to extract quantitative information. In this Letter we point out that this does not have to be the case: lattice QCD simulations on much smaller lattices will produce rigorous results for nuclear physics.",
