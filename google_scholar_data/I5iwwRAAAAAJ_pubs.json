            "Technological attempts have been made in the research and development of rate-controlled oral drug delivery systems to overcome physiological adversities, such as short gastric residence times (GRT) and unpredictable gastric emptying times (GET). It is known that differences in gastric physiology, such as, gastric pH, and motility exhibit both intra-as well as inter-subject variability demonstrating significant impact on gastric retention time and drug delivery behaviour. This triggered the attention towards formulation of stomach specific (gastro retentive) dosage forms. This dosage forms will be very much useful to deliver \u2018narrow absorption window\u2019drugs. Several approaches are currently utilized in the prolongation of the GRT, including floating drug delivery systems (FDDS), swelling and expanding systems, polymeric bioadhesive systems, high-density systems, modified-shape systems and other delayed gastric emptying devices. In this review, current & recent developments of Stomach Specific FDDS are discussed.",

This study investigated the use of activated carbon nanofibers (ACNF) as the anode material to enhance bacterial biofilm growth, and improve MFC performance. Qualitative and quantitative biofilm adhesion analysis indicated that ACNF exhibited better performance over the other commonly used carbon anodes (granular activated carbon (GAC), carbon cloth (CC)). Batch-scale MFC tests showed that MFCs with ACNF and GAC as anodes achieved power densities of 3.50 \u00b1 0.46 W\/m3 and 3.09 \u00b1 0.33 W\/m3 respectively, while MFCs with CC had a lower power density of 1.10 \u00b1 0.21 W\/m3 In addition, the MFCs with ACNF achieved higher contaminant removal efficiency (85 \u00b1 4%) than those of \u2026",

The hydrophilic nature and unique chemical structure of these compounds pose major challenge because of their poor bioavailability through the skin or gut. The use of phytosomes is a novel formulation technology which helps to overcome these problems. The paper provides details of the formulation methodology for phytosomes and describes their chemical and biological properties. The characterization and evaluation technologies used for phytosomes offers insight into different techniques helpful in screening various parameters of phytosomes. The advantages of phytosomes over conventional and liposomal drug delivery systems are also discussed. The scientific usefulness of the technology is reviewed together with a list of important patented technologies involving phytosomes. Thus, in this paper, a complete overview of phytosome technology has been provided for the benefit of the researchers interested in this field.",

The results indicated that PF-MFCs had higher power generation and columbic efficiency (CE) than CM-MFCs, and the power generation varied along with the flow pathway in the PF-MFCs. The gradient of substrate concentrations along the PF-MFCs was the driving force for the power generation. In contrast, the CM-MFCs had higher wastewater removal efficiency than PF-MFCs, but had lower power conversion efficiency and power generation.

The results show that the tablets containing hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin (HP b-CD) with sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) exhibit faster release (1.93-fold) than marketed oxcarbazepine (OXO) tablets. From Weibull parameters, it was shown that Td is three times higher for OXC-HP b-CD with NaCMC tablets than for marketed oxcarbazepine tablets. The release kinetics of OXC complexed with HP b-CD from different tablets was investigated using several mathematical equations. Model-independent methods including difference factor, f1, and similarity factor, f2; model-dependent methods; and ANOVA-based methods were used for the comparison of in vitro dissolution profiles. The results show that ANOVA-based methods and model-dependent methods are more discriminative than model-independent methods. Modelindependent methods seem to be easier to apply and interpret; only one value is obtained to describe the closeness of the two dissolution profiles. The application and evaluation of model-dependent methods are more complicated; these methods present an acceptable model approach to the true relationship between percent dissolved and time variables, including statistical assumptions that could be checked.

Amongst various soluble and insoluble carbon sources tested, cellulose (1.75%, w\/v) showed maximum production of enzymes.

The optimum initial pH for the enzyme production was found to be 5.5, but the maximum production of enzymes occurred when the pH during the cultivation of Scytalidium lignicola CD-48 reached around 6. Mycelia grown from spores in cellulose medium when used as the inoculum (10%, v\/v) enhanced ..beta..-glucosidase production by about 20%. Tween -80 (0.15%, v\/v) and KH\/sub 2\/PO\/sub 4\/ (0.4%, w\/v) were found to be optimum for the production of enzymes.
