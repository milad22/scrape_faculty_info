            "There has been great interest in developing cost-effective and high-performance catalysts for the ozonation treatment of biologically refractory wastewaters. This study developed a novel copper-cerium oxide supported alumina (Cu-Ce\/Al2O3) catalyst for the catalytic ozonation of pulp and paper mill wastewater. The evenly distributed composite metal oxides on the surface of catalysts evidently improved the catalytic degradation efficiency. The Cu-Ce\/Al2O3\/O3 process increased the total organic carbon (TOC) removal by 6.5%, 9.5%, 24.5%, and 35.5%, compared with Ce\/Al2O3\/O3, Cu\/Al2O3\/O3, Al2O3\/O3, and ozone alone processes, respectively. The enhanced catalytic ozonation efficiency was mainly ascribed to an increased hydroxyl radical (\u00b7 OH)-mediated ozonation, both in the bulk solution and on the surface of catalysts. The surface hydroxyl groups (-OHs) of Al2O3 along with the deposited Cu-Ce oxides greatly enhanced the catalytic performance. This work illustrated potential applications of Cu-Ce\/Al2O3 catalyzed ozonation for the advanced treatment of biologically recalcitrant wastewaters.",

            "As a new solar technology, interface steam generation has great prospects in the application of desalination and fractionation. Herein, we report a sustainable, efficient, and accessible loofah-based solar evaporator with a bilayer structure. The top carbonized layer functioned as efficient solar absorbers with broad light absorption and high light trapping. At the bottom layer, attributed to loofah fibers' natural hydrophilicity and hierarchical macropores and microchannels, sufficient water was pumped to the localized heating interface. During desalination, the salt concentration gradient between the macropores and microchannels allowed for efficient salt drainage in the loofah and prevented the accumulation of salt on the surface of the evaporator, thus ensuring long-term stability. This economical light absorber and the water-pumping natural fibers exhibited a steam generation rate of \u223c1.42 kg m\u22122 h\u22121 and an \u2026",

            "Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) particles have been widely used as template for porous materials synthesis. The pore size of porous materials is closely related to the dimension of CNC templates. In the present study, the initial crystal size of raw cellulose material was changed by a simple mercerization treatment, and elliptical- or granule-like CNC with allomorph of cellulose II (CNC-II) was obtained by following sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Then CNC\\SiO2 core\u2013shell particles and porous SiO2 were successfully fabricated based on the templates of CNC-II and conventional CNC, respectively. The results showed that the morphology of CNC\\SiO2 core\u2013shell particles were well copied by corresponding templates. After the template is removed by calcination, the obtained porous SiO2 particles synthesized by CNC-II exhibited a smaller and narrower pore width distribution.",

            "Graphene-based nanocomposites have attracted tremendous attention in recent years. In this study, a facile yet effective approach was developed to synthesize reduced graphene oxide and an Ag\u2013graphene nanocomposite. The basic strategy involved in the preparation of reduced graphene oxide includes reducing graphene oxide with dopamine, followed by in situ syntheses of the Ag-PDA-reducing graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposite through adding AgNO 3 solution and a small amount of dopamine. The nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR spectra, Raman spectra, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), results indicated that a uniform PDA film is formed on the surface of the GO and GO is successfully reduced. Besides, the in situ synthesized Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) were evenly distributed on the RGO surface. To investigate antibacterial properties Ag-PDA-RGO, different dosages were selected for evaluating the antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. The Ag-PDA-RGO nanocomposites displayed excellent antibacterial property. The antibacterial ratio reached 99.9% against S. aureus and 90.9% against E. coli when the dosage of 100 mg\/L Ag-PDA-RGO nanocomposites was 100 \u03bcL. The novel Ag-PDA-RGO nanocomposite prepared by a facile yet effective, environmentally friendly, and low-cost method holds great promise in a wide range of modern biomedical applications.

            "Formation of brown deposit is quite a common problem in hot pressing stage of cellulosic pulp molded tableware production, especially using bleached sugarcane bagasse pulp as raw material which blocks the pipes, corrodes and damages the equipment, increases the cleaning frequency and correspondingly increases the costs as well as reduces the quality of the products. In this work, the composition of the deposit was analyzed, and the effects of fines to the drainage and drying process of cellulosic pulp molded tableware production was studied by thermogravimetric analysis to investigate the cause of this problem. It was found that high contents of fines containing waterproofing agent and oilproofing agent was the main cause of this problem. Compared to the pulps without fines, pulp composed of 100% fines had lower absolute value of zeta-potential and higher adsorption ability of waterproofing agent and \u2026",

Trees as the most abundant renewable bioresource have attracted significant attention for advanced materials and manufacturing in this epochal transition.

Although many excellent reviews have been published regarding advanced applications of wood and wood\u2010derived biopolymers in different fields, such as energy, electronics, biomedical, and water treatment, no reviews have revisited and systematically discussed functional materials and even devices derived from trees in a full scope yet.
