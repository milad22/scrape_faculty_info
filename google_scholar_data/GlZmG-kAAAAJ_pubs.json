The result is fully realistic in that it includes spin correlations, finite width effects, \u03b3\u2212 Z interference and allows for the application of arbitrary cuts on the leptonic decay products of the W and Z. We have implemented this calculation into a numerical program. We demonstrate the use of this code by presenting phenomenological results for several future LHC analyses and recent Tevatron measurements, including the W cross section in the forward rapidity region and the central over forward cross section ratio.",

The program is fully differential in the phase space of leptons and additional hadronic radiation. The new version offers users significantly more options for customization. FEWZ now bins multiple, user-selectable histograms during a single run, and produces parton distribution function (PDF) errors automatically. It also features a significantly improved integration routine, and can take advantage of multiple processor cores locally or on the Condor distributed computing system. We illustrate the new features of FEWZ by presenting numerous phenomenological results for LHC physics. We compare NNLO QCD with initial ATLAS and CMS results, and discuss in detail the \u2026",

An attempt has been made to present the first Report from these subgroups in a complete and homogeneous form. The subgroups' contributions correspondingly comprise the main parts of the Report. A significant amount of work has been performed in providing higher-order corrections to the Higgs-boson cross sections and pinning down the theoretical uncertainty of the Standard Model predictions. This Report comprises explicit numerical results on total cross sections, leaving the issues of event selection cuts and differential distributions to future publications. The subjects for further study are identified.",

            "We present an updated version of the FEWZ (Fully Exclusive W and Z production) code for the calculation of W and gamma*\/Z production at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. Several new features and observables are introduced, and an order-of-magnitude speed improvement over the performance of FEWZ 2.0 is demonstrated. New phenomenological results for W production and comparisons with LHC data are presented, and used to illustrate the range of physics studies possible with the features of FEWZ 2.1. We demonstrate with an example the importance of directly comparing fiducial-region measurements with theoretical predictions, rather than first extrapolating them to the full phase space.",

Our calculation probes the factorization of QCD and electroweak perturbative corrections to this process. We combine our results with the best current estimates for contributions from top and bottom quarks to derive an updated theoretical prediction for the Higgs boson production cross section in gluon fusion. With the use of the MSTW 2008 parton distribution functions that include the newest experimental data, our study results in cross sections approximately 4\u20136% lower for intermediate Higgs boson masses than those used in recent Tevatron analyses that imposed a 95% confidence level exclusion limit of a Standard Model Higgs boson with M H= 170 GeV.",
