            "Unidirectional electric current flow, such as that found in a diode, is essential for modern electronics. It usually occurs at asymmetric interfaces such as p-n junctions or metal\/semiconductor interfaces with Schottky barriers. We report on a diode effect associated with the direction of bulk electric polarization in BiFeO3: a ferroelectric with a small optical gap edge of \u223c2.2 electron volts. We found that bulk electric conduction in ferroelectric monodomain BiFeO3 crystals is highly nonlinear and unidirectional. This diode effect switches its direction when the electric polarization is flipped by an external voltage. A substantial visible-light photovoltaic effect is observed in BiFeO3 diode structures. These results should improve understanding of charge conduction mechanisms in leaky ferroelectrics and advance the design of switchable devices combining ferroelectric, electronic, and optical functionalities.",

The signatures of this intrinsic transport are the anisotropy of the carrier mobility, \u03bc, and the growth of \u03bc with cooling. Anisotropy of \u03bc vanishes in the activation regime at low temperatures, where the transport is dominated by shallow traps. The deep traps, introduced by x-ray radiation, increase the field-effect threshold without affecting \u03bc, an indication that the filled traps do not scatter polarons.",

The spinel crystallographic structure, first solved by Bragg in 1915 1, has cations occupying both tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites. Interesting physics arises when the B-site cations become mixed in valence. Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) is a classic and still unresolved example, where the tendency to form ordered arrays of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions competes with the topological frustration of the B-site network 2. The CuIr 2 S 4 thiospinel is another example, well known for the presence of a metal\u2013insulator transition at 230 K with an abrupt decrease of the electrical conductivity on cooling accompanied by the loss of localized magnetic moments 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

We demonstrate that specific electronic properties of charge-ordered manganites stem from a combination of martensitic accommodation strain and effects of strong electron correlations. This intrinsic strain is strongly affected by the grain boundaries in ceramic samples. Consistently, our studies show a remarkable enhancement of low field magnetoresistance and the grain size effect on the resistivity in polycrystalline samples and suggest that the transport properties of this class of manganites are governed by the charge-disordered insulating phase stabilized at low temperature by virtue of martensitic accommodation strain. High sensitivity of this phase to strains and magnetic field leads \u2026",
