            "We review the predictions of the theory of a color glass condensate for a gluon production cross section in p (d) A collisions. We demonstrate that, at moderate energies, when the gluon production cross section can be calculated in the framework of the McLerran-Venugopalan model, it has only a partonic level Cronin effect in it. At higher energies or rapidities corresponding to smaller values of the Bjorken x, quantum evolution becomes important. The effect of quantum evolution at higher energies or rapidities is to introduce the suppression of high-p T gluons slightly decreasing the Cronin enhancement. At still higher energies or rapidities quantum evolution leads to the suppression of produced gluons at all values of p T.",

For that purpose we extend the sum rule analysis by including the contribution of light quarks. We also discuss the universal properties of bulk viscosity in the vicinity of a second-order phase transition, as it might occur in the chiral limit of QCD at fixed strange quark mass and most likely does occur in two-flavor QCD. We point out that a chiral transition in the O (4) universality class at zero baryon density as well as the transition at the chiral critical point which belongs to the Z (2) universality class both lead to the critical behavior of bulk viscosity. In particular, the latter universality class implies the divergence of the bulk viscosity, which may be used as a signature of the critical point.

I demonstrate by explicit analytical calculation that after dropping by about one-two orders of magnitude during the first fm\/c of plasma expansion, it freezes out and lasts for as long as quark-gluon plasma lives as a consequence of finite electrical conductivity of the plasma. Magnetic field breaks spherical symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane, and therefore all kinetic coefficients are anisotropic. I examine viscosity of QGP and show that magnetic field induces azimuthal anisotropy on plasma flow even in spherically symmetric geometry. Very strong electromagnetic field has an important impact on particle production. I discuss the problem of energy loss and polarization of fast fermions due to synchrotron radiation, consider photon decay induced by magnetic field, elucidate                  dissociation via Lorentz ionization mechanism, and examine electromagnetic radiation by plasma. I conclude that all processes in QGP are affected by strong electromagnetic field and call for experimental investigation.",

            "Kubo's formula relates bulk viscosity to the retarded Green's function of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Using low energy theorems of QCD for the latter we derive the formula which relates the bulk viscosity to the energy density and pressure of hot matter. We then employ the available lattice QCD data to extract the bulk viscosity as a function of temperature. We find that close to the deconfinement temperature bulk viscosity becomes large, with viscosity-to-entropy ratio \u03b6\/s~ 1.",
