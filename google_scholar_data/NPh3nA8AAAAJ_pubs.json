            "The pursuit of better atomic clocks has advanced many research areas, providing better quantum state control, new insights in quantum science, tighter limits on fundamental constant variation and improved tests of relativity. The record for the best stability and accuracy is currently held by optical lattice clocks. Here we take an important step towards realizing the full potential of a many-particle clock with a state-of-the-art stable laser. Our 87 Sr optical lattice clock now achieves fractional stability of 2.2\u00d7 10\u2212 16 at 1 s. With this improved stability, we perform a new accuracy evaluation of our clock, reducing many systematic uncertainties that limited our previous measurements, such as those in the lattice ac Stark shift, the atoms\u2019 thermal environment and the atomic response to room-temperature blackbody radiation. Our combined measurements have reduced the total uncertainty of the JILA Sr clock to 2.1\u00d7 10\u2212 18 in \u2026",

            "Atomic polarization phenomena impinge upon a number of areas and processes in physics. The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave \u2026",

The calculations are based on the relativistic single-double (SD) approximation in which single and double excitations of Dirac-Hartree-Fock wave functions are included to all orders in perturbation theory. Using SD wave functions, accurate values of removal energies, electric-dipole matrix elements, and static polarizabilities are obtained; however, SD wave functions give poor values of the magnetic-dipole hyperfine constants for heavy atoms. To obtain accurate values of the hyperfine constants for heavy atoms, we include triple excitations partially in the wave functions.

We introduce a measurement technique based on high-efficiency quantum state detection after coherent excitation to the D 5\u2215 2 state or incoherent shelving in the D 3\u2215 2 state, and subsequent free, unperturbed spontaneous decay. The result for the natural lifetime of the D 5\u2215 2 state of 1168 (9) ms agrees excellently with the most precise published value. The lifetime of the D 3\u2215 2 state is measured with a single ion and yields 1176 (11) ms which improves the statistical uncertainty of previous results by a factor of four. We compare these experimental lifetimes to high-precision ab initio all order calculations [D 3\u2215 2 state: 1196 (11) ms; D 5\u2215 2 state: 1165 (11) ms] and find a very good agreement.
