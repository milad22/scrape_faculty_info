The conductance spectra show fully developed quasiparticle tunneling, Andreev reflection, and zero-bias peak characteristics, depending systematically on the junction orientation and impedance. Quantitative spectral analysis using the generalized formalism of Blonder, Tinkham, and Klapwijk (BTK) indicates a predominantly d x 2\u2212 y 2 pairing symmetry, with less than 5% s-wave component in either the d+ s or d+ i s scenario.",

The study of out-diffusion of oxygen was carried out by annealing the oxide in ambient helium at constant heating rates and at constant temperatures. The rate of out-diffusion of oxygen has been found to be independent of \u03b4, and the resistivity changes linearly with time during isothermal anneals. Assuming that the rate of out-diffusion is surface reaction limited, we have determined a surface barrier of 1.7 eV. The study of in-diffusion of oxygen was performed by annealing the oxygen-deficient oxide (\u03b4= 0.38) in ambient oxygen. The in-diffusion rate was found to depend strongly on \u03b4; we have determined the activation energies of the process at \u03b4= 0.38 and \u03b4= 0 to be 0.5 eV and 1.3 eV, respectively. The diffusivity of oxygen for \u03b4= 0 has been determined to be D= 0.035 exp (\u2212 1.3 eV\/k T \u2026",

            "Direct experimental evidence of half-metallic density of states (DOS) is observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy on ferromagnetic La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3, which exhibits colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). Tunneling conductance data taken at 77 K, well below the Curie temperature T C\u2248 260 K, show close resemblance to the spin-split DOS spectrum calculated for the itinerant bands in the ferromagnetic state. The half-metallic spectral characteristics are absent in the paramagnetic state at room temperature, as well as in the undoped antiferromagnetic compound LaMnO 3, which shows no CMR. These results directly implicate the half-metallic ferromagnetism in the phenomenon of CMR.",

            "Graphene has emerged as an electronic material that is promising for device applications and for studying two-dimensional electron gases with relativistic dispersion near two Dirac points. Nonetheless, deviations from Dirac-like spectroscopy have been widely reported with varying interpretations. Here we show evidence for strain-induced spatial modulations in the local conductance of single-layer graphene on SiO2 substrates from scanning tunneling microscopic (STM) studies. We find that strained graphene exhibits parabolic, U-shaped conductance vs bias voltage spectra rather than the V-shaped spectra expected for Dirac fermions, whereas V-shaped spectra are recovered in regions of relaxed graphene. Strain maps derived from the STM studies further reveal direct correlation with the local tunneling conductance. These results are attributed to a strain-induced frequency increase in the out-of-plane phonon \u2026",
