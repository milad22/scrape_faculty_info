            "Two dimensional nanoarchitectures are of great interest in lithium storage for energy\u2010storage devices, in particular lithium\u2010ion batteries, due to its shortened paths for fast lithium ion diffusion and large exposed surface offering more lithium\u2010insertion channels. Their competitive lithium\u2010storage features provide huge potentials to develop next\u2010generation high\u2010performance lithium\u2010ion batteries. This review is devoted to the recent progress in the fabrication of innovative 2D structures with various synthetic strategies and their applications for lithium storage in lithium\u2010ion batteries. These 2D architectures are categorized into six styles, i.e., nanoporous nanosheets, ultrathin nanosheets, flower\u2010like structures assembled by nanosheets, sandwich\u2010like nanosheets, corrugated nanosheets, and nanosheets with specific facets. Based on the lithium\u2010storage manner, we further summerized their electrochemical performance \u2026",

At 0.1 V, the specific activity of PtAu\/C with Pt\/Au mole ratio 1:8 was more than one order of magnitude higher than the conventional Pt\/C.
