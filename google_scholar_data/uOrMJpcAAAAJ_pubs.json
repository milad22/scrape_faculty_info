The variation of the Higgs field results in the presence of electromagnetic fields after the completion of the phase transition. This mechanism would also produce magnetic fields of other unbroken gauge symmetries such as SU(3)c. We estimate the strength of the electromagnetic fields produced due to the electroweak phase transition.",

The fractal dimension of the strings and the size distribution of closed loops are determined, and it is shown that infinite strings contribute about 80% to the total length of strings in the universe. The results are used to analyze the cosmological evolution of strings. Formation of domain walls and of walls bounded by strings is also discussed, and it is shown that in both cases the system is dominated by one infinite cluster of very complicated topology. The results of the simulations may also be of interest in condensed-matter systems where similar topological defects can be formed.",

We show that wakes produced by such \u2018\u2018wiggly\u2019\u2019cosmic strings can result in the efficient formation of large-scale structure and large streaming velocities in the Universe without significantly affecting the microwave-background isotropy. We also argue that the motion of strings will lead to the generation of a primordial magnetic field. The most promising version of this scenario appears to be the one in which the Universe is dominated by light neutrinos.",

Models in which inflation arises from field dynamics in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background fall into this class but models in which inflation originates at the Planck epoch may evade this conclusion. Our arguments rest on causality and general relativistic constraints on the structure of spacetime. We discuss modifications to existing scenarios that may avoid the need for initial large-scale homogeneity.",

This formalism is applied to calculate the rate of Goldstone-boson radiation from a class of closed-loop trajectories. The lifetime of a typical loop is found to be very short, about twenty oscillation periods, in agreement with an earlier estimate by Davis.",
