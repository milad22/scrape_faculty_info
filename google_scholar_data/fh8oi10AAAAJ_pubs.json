Herein, we developed a more sustainable method to produce silicon nanowires (Si NWs) in bulk quantities through the direct electrochemical reduction of CaSiO3, an abundant and inexpensive Si source soluble in molten salts, at a low temperature of 650\u2009\u00b0C by using low\u2010melting\u2010point ternary molten salts CaCl2\u2013MgCl2\u2013NaCl, which still retains high CaSiO3 solubility, and a supporting electrolyte of CaO, which facilitates the transport of O2\u2212 anions, drastically improves the reaction kinetics, and enables the electrolysis at low temperatures. The Si nanowire product can be used as high\u2010capacity Li\u2010ion battery anode materials with excellent cycling performance.

Herein, the hitherto unexplored alloys of PbSe with NaSbSe2 (NaPbmSbSem+2) are described and the most promising p\u2010type PbSe\u2010based thermoelectrics are found among them. Surprisingly, it is observed that below 500 K, NaPbmSbSem+2 exhibits unorthodox semiconducting\u2010like electrical conductivity, despite possessing degenerate carrier densities of \u22481020 cm\u22123. It is shown that the peculiar behavior derives from carrier scattering by the grain boundaries. It is further demonstrated that the high solubility of NaSbSe2 in PbSe augments both the thermoelectric properties while maintaining a rock salt structure.

However, their thermal transport behavior has received limited attention. In this work, we studied the thermal transport and thermoelectric properties of the CsSnBr3-xIx perovskites. We find a strong correlation between lattice dynamics and an ultralow thermal conductivity for series CsSnBr3-xIx reaching 0.32 Wm\u20131K\u20131 at 550 K. The CsSnBr3-xIx also possess a decent Seebeck coefficient and controllable electrical transport properties. The crystallography data and theoretical calculations suggest the Cs atom deviates from its ideal cuboctahedral geometry imposed by the perovskite cage and behaves as a heavy atom rattling oscillator.

Currently, PbTe based compounds are the leading thermoelectric materials in the intermediate temperature regime (\u223c800 K); however, integration into commercial devices has been limited. This is largely because the performance of PbTe, which is maximized \u223c900 K, is too low over the temperatures of interest for most potential commercial applications (generally under 600 K). Improving the low temperature performance of PbTe based materials is therefore critical to achieve usage outside of existing niche applications. Here, we provide an in-depth study of the cubic NaPbmSbTem+2 system of compounds (m = 1\u201320) and report that it is an excellent class of low- to medium-temperature thermoelectrics when m = 10\u201320.

In such polycrystalline materials heat carrying phonons are scattered at the grain boundaries, which directly improves the thermoelectric quality factor and ultimately the figure-of-merit zT. In some cases, however, such as in Mg3Sb2, SnSe, and Mg2Si an opposite trend is found where higher lattice thermal conductivity reported in small grain polycrystalline material than in large grain or single crystal materials. This unphysical result indicates a problem with the conventional use of the Wiedemann\u2013Franz law.

            "Many thermoelectric materials feature irregular electrical conductivity with thermally activated transport below \u223c600 K and metallic behavior at high temperatures, despite possessing degenerate carrier concentrations. The suppression of the electrical conductivity ultimately degrades the thermoelectric performance on the cold side and limits the device energy conversion efficiency. As such, establishing the origin of the low temperature scattering and developing strategies to mitigate its effect are paramount issues. To date, the correct microscopic description of the low temperature carrier scattering remains an open issue, and there is little work addressing why some thermoelectric materials are more susceptible to the deleterious behavior. Here, we use the promising thermoelectric alloys of PbQ and NaSbQ2 (Q = S, Se, Te) as model systems to address these concerns. We directly show the thermally activated \u2026",
