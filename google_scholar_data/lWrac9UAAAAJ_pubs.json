            "The CD4+CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes have been implicated in suppressing T cell immune responses. Our aim was to characterize the frequency, phenotype, function, and specificity of CD4+CD25+ T cells in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Peripheral CD4+CD25+ cells from recovered (n = 15), chronic infected (n = 30), and normal control (n = 15) subjects were analyzed ex vivo for quantitation, phenotype, and effect on HCV\u2010specific interferon gamma production and proliferation. CD4+CD25+ specificity was determined by intracellular cytokine staining for interleukin 10 (IL\u201010). A higher proportion of CD4+CD25+ were found in chronic infection (mean, 3.02%) when compared with recovered (1.64%, P = .001) and normal controls (2.27%, P = .02). CD4+CD25+ cells display CD45ROhigh, CD45RAlow, CD28high, CD62Lhigh, and CD95high phenotype. HCV\u2010specific interferon gamma activity was enhanced in \u2026",

            "Alloantigen expression on host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is essential to initiate graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); therefore, alloantigen expression on host target epithelium is also thought to be essential for tissue damage. We tested this hypothesis in mouse models of GvHD using bone-marrow chimeras in which either major histocompatibility complex class I or class II alloantigen was expressed only on APCs. We found that acute GvHD does not require alloantigen expression on host target epithelium and that neutralization of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1 prevents acute GvHD. These results pertain particularly to CD4-mediated GvHD but also apply, at least in part, to CD8-mediated GvHD. These results challenge current paradigms about the antigen specificity of GvHD effector mechanisms and confirm the central roles of both host APCs and inflammatory cytokines in acute GvHD.",

            "Epithelial regeneration is critical for barrier maintenance and organ function after intestinal injury. The intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche provides Wnt, Notch and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signals supporting Lgr5+ crypt base columnar ISCs for normal epithelial maintenance 1, 2. However, little is known about the regulation of the ISC compartment after tissue damage. Using ex vivo organoid cultures, here we show that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), potent producers of interleukin-22 (IL-22) after intestinal injury 3, 4, increase the growth of mouse small intestine organoids in an IL-22-dependent fashion. Recombinant IL-22 directly targeted ISCs, augmenting the growth of both mouse and human intestinal organoids, increasing proliferation and promoting ISC expansion. IL-22 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in Lgr5+ ISCs, and STAT3 was crucial for both organoid formation and IL-22-mediated regeneration \u2026",
