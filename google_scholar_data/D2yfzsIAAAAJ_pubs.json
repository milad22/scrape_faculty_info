            "Topological insulators are a new phase of matter 1, with the striking property that conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces 1, 2, 3. In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties 11, 12, 14. Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect 15, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external \u2026",

Aaronson and Arkhipov 6 have shown that interference of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem of sampling the bosonic output distribution. Remarkably, this computation does not require measurement-based interactions 7, 8 or adaptive feed-forward techniques 9. Here, we demonstrate this model of computation using laser-written integrated quantum networks that were designed to implement unitary matrix transformations.

Photonic PT-symmetric systems that also support topological states could be useful for shaping and routing light waves. However, it is currently debated whether topological interface states can exist at all in PT-symmetric systems. Here, we show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the existence of such states: states that are localized at the interface between two topologically distinct PT-symmetric photonic lattices. We find analytical closed form solutions of topological PT-symmetric interface states, and observe them through fluorescence microscopy in a passive PT-symmetric dimerized photonic lattice.

            "We present the first experimental observation of a topological transition in a non-Hermitian system. In contrast to standard methods for examining topological properties, which involve probing edge (or surface) states, we monitor the topological transition by employing bulk dynamics only. The system is composed of a lattice of evanescently coupled optical waveguides, and non-Hermitian behavior is engineered by inducing bending loss by spatially \u201cwiggling\u201d every second waveguide.",
