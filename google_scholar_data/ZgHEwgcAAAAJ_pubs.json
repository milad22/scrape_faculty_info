            "Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common form of malignant glioma in adults. Although protected by both the blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013tumor barriers, GBMs are actively infiltrated by T cells. Previous work has shown that IDO, CTLA-4, and PD-L1 are dominant molecular participants in the suppression of GBM immunity. This includes IDO-mediated regulatory T-cell (Treg; CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) accumulation, the interaction of T-cell\u2013expressed, CTLA-4, with dendritic cell-expressed, CD80, as well as the interaction of tumor- and\/or macrophage-expressed, PD-L1, with T-cell\u2013expressed, PD-1. The individual inhibition of each pathway has been shown to increase survival in the context of experimental GBM. However, the impact of simultaneously targeting all three pathways in brain tumors has been left unanswered.Experimental Design and Results: In this report, we demonstrate that, when dually challenged \u2026",

A major hurdle to adenoviral-mediated gene therapy is the innate immune system. Cell-mediated recognition of viruses via capsid components or nucleic acids has received significant attention, principally thought to be regulated by the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Antiviral innate immune responses are initiated by the infected cell, which activates the interferon (IFN) response to block viral replication, while simultaneously releasing chemokines to attract neutrophils, mononuclear-and natural killer-cells. While the IFN and cellular recruitment pathways are activated and regulated independently of each other, both are required to overcome immune escape mechanisms by adenoviruses.

            "One of the hallmark features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult primary brain tumor with a very dismal prognosis, is the accumulation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) segregate into two primary categories: thymus-derived natural Tregs (nTregs) that develop from the interaction between immature T cells and thymic epithelial stromal cells, and inducible Tregs (iTregs) that arise from the conversion of CD4+FoxP3- T cells into FoxP3 expressing cells. Normally, these Treg subsets complement one another\u2019s actions by maintaining tolerance of self-antigens, thereby suppressing autoimmunity, while also enabling effective immune responses towards non-self-antigens, thus promoting infectious protection. However, Tregs have also been shown to be associated with the promotion of pathological outcomes, including cancer. In the setting of GBM, nTregs appear to be primary players that contribute to immunotherapeutic failure; ultimately leading to tumor progression. Several attempts have been made to therapeutically target these cells with variable levels of success. The blood brain barrier-crossing chemotherapeutics, temozolomide and cyclophosphamide, vaccination against the Treg transcriptional regulator, FoxP3, as well as mAbs against Treg-associated cell surface molecules CD25, CTLA-4 and GITR are all different therapeutic approaches under investigation. Contributing to the poor success of past approaches is the expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), a tryptophan catabolizing enzyme overexpressed in GBM and critically involved in regulating tumor-infiltrating \u2026",
