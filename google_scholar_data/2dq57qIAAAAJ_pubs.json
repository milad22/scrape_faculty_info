            "Rheology, morphology and mechanical properties of binary PE and EVA blends together with their thermal behavior were studied. The results of rheological studies showed that, for given PE and EVA, the interfacial interaction in PE-rich blends is higher than EVA-rich blends, which in turn led to finer and well-distributed morphology in PE-rich blends. Using two different models, the phase inversion composition was predicted to be in 45 and 47 wt% of the PE phase. This was justified by morphological studies, where a clear co-continuous morphology for 50\/50 blend was observed. The tensile strength for PE-rich blends showed positive deviation from mixing rule, whereas the 50\/50 blend and EVA-rich blends displayed negative deviation. These results were in a good agreement with the results of viscoelastic behavior of the blends. The elongation at break was found to follow the same trend as tensile strength \u2026",

To probe the effect of curing agent on interfacial interactions, computations were performed for either uncured or aminoamide-cured epoxy resins.

In such systems, the degree to which superior properties can be guaranteed depends on the state of network formation in the epoxy in the presence of nanoparticles. For low-filled epoxy nanocomposite coatings, barrierity was taken as the main mechanism controlling over the efficiency of corrosion inhibition in the coating against oxygen or other corrosive moieties, whilst in highly-loaded nanocomposites one should take a closer look at both physical and chemical interaction between the resin and nanoparticles.
