Our data demonstrate that several Lifshitz transitions\u2014topological changes of the Fermi surface\u2014occur for large x. The central hole barrel changes to ellipsoids that are centered at Z at x\u223c 0.11 and subsequently disappear around x\u223c 0.2; changes in thermoelectric power occur at similar x values. T c decreases and goes to zero around x\u223c 0.15\u2014between the two Lifshitz transitions. Beyond x= 0.2 the central pocket becomes electron-like and superconductivity does not exist.

Although growths of single crystals of Ba (Fe 1\u2212 x Mn x) 2 As 2 for the full 0\u2a7d x\u2a7d 1 range were made, we find evidence for phase separation (associated with some form of immiscibility) starting for x> 0.1\u20130.2.
