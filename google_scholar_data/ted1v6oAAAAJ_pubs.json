This is done within a formalism which includes the Zeeman and dipolar contributions to the spin-wave energy, with exchange omitted. We then calculate the spin-wave contribution to the Brillouin spectrum of such a system, in the backscattering geometry. The aim is to compare the spectrum for scattering from a sample with this geometry, with that from an isolated film. Two features unique to the stack appear in the spectrum. Each film, in isolation, possesses surface spin waves on its boundaries (Damon-Eshbach waves). In the layered geometry these interact to form a band of excitations of the array, which has nonvanishing component of wave vector normal to the stack.

Sulfur depletion, without destabilization of the single layer, is considered a prudent way for making the basal plane of the layer catalytically active. Based on the results of our density-functional-theory examination of vacancy structures on one side of an MoS2 layer, we show that the formation energy per sulfur vacancy is the lowest (energetically favorable) when the vacancies form a row and that the longer the row, the lower the formation energy. In addition, we find that the lowest energy barrier for the diffusion of sulfur vacancy at the row structures through the exchange of a vacancy with a nearby sulfur atom is 0.79 eV and that this barrier increases as the row elongates. We also evaluate the propensity for catalytic activity of an MoS2 layer with two types of sulfur-vacancy structures (row and patch \u2026",

Here we demonstrate that electrospray ion beam deposition facilitates grafting of intact Mn12 molecules on metal as well as ultrathin insulating surfaces enabling submolecular resolution imaging by scanning tunneling microscopy. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we detect spin excitations from the magnetic ground state of the molecule at an ultrathin boron nitride decoupling layer.

This self-learning procedure enhances the speed of the simulations along with a substantial gain in reliability because of the inclusion of many-particle processes. Accompanying results from the application of the method to the case of two-dimensional Cu adatom-cluster diffusion and coalescence on Cu (111) with detailed statistics of involved atomistic processes and contributing diffusion coefficients attest to the suitability of the method for the purpose.",

            "The vacancy formation energies and (Mg, Al, and Si) impurity heats of solution are calculated for Al and Mg using a first-principles pseudopotential approach and large supercells. While the interaction of the defects considered here are already negligible for reasonably small unit cells, adequate sampling of the Brillouin zone is found to be essential for these metallic systems, even for systems containing more than 100 atoms per unit cell; eg, the vacancy formation energy of Al for 108 atoms per cell has the incorrect sign if only the \u0393 point is sampled. When the volume and structural relaxations are treated consistently, heats of formation and solution and relaxation volumes are obtained that are in good agreement with the available experimental data. Simple trends in the relaxations around the impurities in the various materials can be understood in terms of the size of the impurities compared with the host atoms \u2026",
