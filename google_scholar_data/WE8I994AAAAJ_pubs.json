A main effect for commercial type was also noted, with emotional commercials leading to generally more positive reactions than informational commercials. A significant program-by-commercial interaction was obtained for the viewer's mood during the commercial, with the program effect greater for those viewing emotional commercials than for those viewing informational commercials.",

In an initial study in which adolescents coded 194 advertisements, the authors identified seven common message themes. Using protection motivation theory, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the message theme effects on cognitions and intentions and test them in an experiment involving 1667 adolescents. Three of the seven message themes increased adolescents\u2019 nonsmoking intentions compared with a control; all did so by enhancing adolescents\u2019 perceptions that smoking poses severe social disapproval risks. Other message themes increased health risk severity perceptions but were undermined by low perceived vulnerability.",

Using a national sample of 9\u2010 to 14\u2010year\u2010olds, in this study we developed a Youth Materialism Scale. The findings suggest that more materialistic youth tend to shop more and save less. They are most interested in new products and most responsive to advertising and promotional efforts. Their parents view them as more expert with regard to products and they wield more purchase influence on their parents. Parents who are more materialistic tend to have children who are more materialistic. This study also reveals a modest negative relation between materialism and liking for school and school performance.",
