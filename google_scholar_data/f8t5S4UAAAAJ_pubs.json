Amine- and oxide-functionalized SiNWs exhibit pH-dependent conductance that was linear over a large dynamic range and could be understood in terms of the change in surface charge during protonation and deprotonation. Biotin-modified SiNWs were used to detect streptavidin down to at least a picomolar concentration range. In addition, antigen-functionalized SiNWs show reversible antibody binding and concentration-dependent detection in real time. Lastly, detection of the reversible binding of the metabolic indicator Ca2+ was demonstrated. The small size and capability of these semiconductor nanowires for sensitive, label-free, real-time detection of a wide range of chemical and biological species could be exploited in array-based screening and in vivo \u2026",

The coupling is manifest as quantized nano-mechanical oscillations of the C 60 molecule against the gold surface, with a frequency of about 1.2 THz.

            "When an individual molecule 1, nanocrystal 2, 3, 4, nanotube 5, 6 or lithographically defined quantum dot 7 is attached to metallic electrodes via tunnel barriers, electron transport is dominated by single-electron charging and energy-level quantization 8. As the coupling to the electrodes increases, higher-order tunnelling and correlated electron motion give rise to new phenomena 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, including the Kondo resonance 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

The fabrication is achieved by passing a large electrical current through a gold nanowire defined by electron-beam lithography and shadow evaporation. The current flow causes the electromigration of gold atoms and the eventual breakage of the nanowire. The breaking process yields two stable metallic electrodes separated by \u223c1 nm with high efficiency. These electrodes are ideally suited for electron-transport studies of chemically synthesized nanostructures, and their utility is demonstrated here by fabricating single-electron transistors based on colloidal cadmium selenide nanocrystals.",

            "Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, with important functional consequences 4, 5. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs 1, 2 or proteins 5, 6 simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods 3 could not be applied to single cells until very recently 7, 8, 9, 10. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune \u2026",

            "Nearly monodisperse iron nanoclusters have been used to define the diameters of carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Iron nanoparticles with average diameters of 3, 9, and 13 nm were used to grow carbon nanotubes with average diameters of 3, 7, and 12 nm, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy studies of the nanotubes show that the as-grown nanotubes are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) or thin multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with 2 or 3 layers. Investigations of the growth conditions also demonstrate that the supply of carbon reactant is critical for enabling the growth of large diameter nanotubes from large iron nanoclusters, and that the growth temperature is especially important for achieving high-quality large diameter nanotubes. The implications of these results and possible applications of the nanotubes are discussed. ",
