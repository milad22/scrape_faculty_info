            "In an experiment at the SISSI-LISE3 facility of GANIL, the decay of the proton drip line nucleus F 45 e has been studied. Fragment-implantation events have been correlated with radioactive decay events in a 16\u00d7 16 pixel silicon-strip detector. The decay-energy spectrum of F 45 e implants shows a distinct peak at (1.14\u00b10.04) M e V with a half-life of T 1\/2=(4.7\u2212 1.4+ 3.4) m s. None of the events in this peak is in coincidence with \u03b2 particles. For a longer correlation interval, daughter decays of the two-proton daughter C 43 r can be observed after F 45 e implantation. The decay energy for F 45 e agrees nicely with several theoretical predictions for two-proton radioactivity.",

The data allowed us to study the decay properties of 26 nuclei. The main experimental information obtained for all nuclei is their \u03b2-decay half-life and their total \u03b2-delayed proton emission branching ratio. For many nuclei, individual proton groups and \u03b3 rays were identified and allowed us to establish first partial decay schemes for some of the nuclei studied. In addition, mass-excess values have been determined for some of the nuclei by means of the isobaric multiplet mass equation. For 50 Ni, the decay via \u03b2-delayed two-proton emission could be tentatively identified. The decay of 49 Ni allowed for the first time to identify the first 2+ state in 48 Fe.

We obtained clear evidence for the existence of the five new isotopes 60 Ga, 64 As, 6 9, 7 0 Kr, and 74 Sr. However, we did not find any evidence for 69 Br, whereas comparable nuclei were observed with more than 1000 counts. The isotope 69 Br is thus deduced to be a proton-unbound nucleus with a half-life shorter than about 100 ns. The influence of these results on our understanding of the astrophysical RP process is discussed.",
