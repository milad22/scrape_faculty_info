            "Magnetism and ferroelectricity are essential to many forms of current technology, and the quest for multiferroic materials, where these two phenomena are intimately coupled, is of great technological and fundamental importance. Ferroelectricity and magnetism tend to be mutually exclusive and interact weakly with each other when they coexist. The exciting new development is the discovery that even a weak magnetoelectric interaction can lead to spectacular cross-coupling effects when it induces electric polarization in a magnetically ordered state. Such magnetic ferroelectricity, showing an unprecedented sensitivity to ap plied magnetic fields, occurs in'frustrated magnets' with competing interactions between spins and complex magnetic orders. We summarize key experimental findings and the current theoretical understanding of these phenomena, which have great potential for tuneable multifunctional devices.",

Magnetism and ferroelectricity are involved with local spins and off-centre structural distortions, respectively. These two seemingly unrelated phenomena can coexist in certain unusual materials, termed multiferroics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Despite the possible coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism, a pronounced interplay between these properties has rarely been observed 6, 12. This has prevented the realization of multiferroic devices offering such functionality 13. Here, we report a striking interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in the multiferroic TbMn 2 O 5, demonstrated by a highly reproducible electric polarization reversal and permanent polarization imprint that are both actuated by an applied magnetic field.

But it remains unclear why the magnetoresistive response increases dramatically when the Curie temperature (T C) is reduced. In these materials, T C varies sensitively with changing chemical pressure; this can be achieved by introducing trivalent rare-earth ions of differing size into the perovskite structure 2, 3, 4, without affecting the valency of the Mn ions. The chemical pressure modifies local structural parameters such as the Mn\u2013O bond distance and Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn bond angle, which directly influence the case of electron hopping between Mn ions (that is, the electronic bandwidth).

Some of these oxides show 100% magnetoresistance and have much potential for technological applications. Previously this phenomenon was found only in layered and granular metallic materials. Studies of colossal magnetoresistance have led to the discovery of many other new phenomena and properties such as charge ordering and orbital ordering. In view of the importance of colossal magnetoresistance, charge ordering and related phenomena exhibited by oxides to the physics and chemistry of solid materials, it is necessary and timely to have a book dealing with these topics.

            "The propensity of systems of charge and spin to form, under certain conditions,\u2018stripe\u2019phases has recently attracted much attention, as it has been suggested that dynamically fluctuating stripe phases may be of central importance for an understanding of the physics of high-temperature superconductors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. A related phenomenon\u2014static charge stripes\u2014characterizes 6 the insulating antiferromagnetic ground state of the manganese oxides, a class of materials which (like the copper oxide superconductors) have a perovskite structure, and are notable for their extraordinary electronic and magnetic properties, such as colossal magnetoresistance and charge ordering 7, 8. Here we report a different pattern of charge localization in the charge-ordered phase of the manganese oxide La 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3 (x\u2a7e 0.5). This pattern takes the form of extremely stable pairs of Mn 3+ O 6 stripes, with associated large lattice \u2026",

            "The unusual magnetic properties of La 0.5 Ca 0.5 MnO 3 were found to be associated with structural and magnetic ordering phenomena, resulting from the close interplay between charge, orbital, and magnetic ordering. Analysis of synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction data indicates that the anomalous and hysteretic behavior of the lattice parameters occurring between T C\u223c 225 K and T N\u223c 155 K is due to the development of a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of the MnO 6 octahedra, the d z 2> orbitals being oriented perpendicular to the orthorhombic b axis. We observed an unusual broadening of the x-ray Bragg reflections throughout this temperature region, suggesting that this process occurs in stages. Below T N, the development of well-defined satellite peaks in the x-ray patterns, associated with a transverse modulation with q=[1\/2-\u025b, 0, 0], indicates that quasicommensurate (\u025b\u223c 0) orbital ordering \u2026",
