            "Optimization of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for InGaN quantum wells (QWs) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is investigated. Staggered InGaN QWs with large electron-hole wavefunction overlap and improved radiative recombination rate are investigated for nitride LEDs application. The effect of interface abruptness in staggered InGaN QWs on radiative recombination rate is studied. Studies show that the less interface abruptness between the InGaN sub-layers will not affect the performance of the staggered InGaN QWs detrimentally. The growths of linearly-shaped staggered InGaN QWs by employing graded growth temperature grading are presented. The effect of current injection efficiency on IQE of InGaN QWs LEDs and other approaches to reduce dislocation in InGaN QWs LEDs are also discussed. The optimization of both radiative efficiency and current injection efficiency in InGaN QWs LEDs are required for \u2026",

            "Domains and domain walls are a fundamental property of interest in ferroelectrics, magnetism, ferroelastics, superconductors, and multiferroic materials. Unlike magnetic Bloch walls, ideal ferroelectric domain walls are well accepted to be only one to two lattice units wide, over which polarization and strain change across the wall. However, walls in real ferroelectrics appear to show unexpected property variations in the vicinity of domain walls that can extend over micrometer length scales. This chapter specifically reviews the local electrical, elastic, optical, and structural properties of antiparallel domain walls in the trigonal ferroelectrics lithium niobate and lithium tantalate. It is shown that extrinsic point defects and their clustering play a key role in the observed local wall structure and influence macroscale properties by orders of magnitude. The review also raises broader and yet unexplored fundamental questions \u2026",

This intense emission is characterized by a long room-temperature lifetime (\u223c375ps) comparable to that seen in low defect density (\u223c108cm\u22122) GaN. Room-temperature monochromatic cathodoluminescence images at the redshifted peak reveal spatially nonuniform emission similar to that observed in In(Al)GaN alloys and attributed to compositional inhomogeneity. These observations suggest that spatial localization enhances the luminescence efficiency despite the high defect density (>1010cm\u22122) of the films by inhibiting movement of carriers to nonradiative sites.",

The exact structure and energetics of such proposed intrinsic defects and defect clusters remains unverified by either first-principles calculations or experiments. Here, density functional theory (DFT) is used to determine the dominant intrinsic defects in Li Nb O 3 under various conditions. In particular, in an Nb 2 O 5-rich environment, a cluster consisting of a niobium antisite compensated by four lithium vacancies is predicted to be the most stable defect structure, thereby verifying what was thus far a conjecture in the literature. Under Li 2 O-rich conditions, the lithium Frenkel defect is predicted to be the most stable, with a positive defect formation energy (DFE). This is proposed as the underlying \u2026",
