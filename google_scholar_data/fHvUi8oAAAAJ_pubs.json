The temperature-dependent Raman spectra of exfoliated, monolayer MoS2 in the range of 100\u2013320 K are reported and analyzed. The linear temperature coefficients of the in-plane E2g1 and the out-of-plane A1g modes for both suspended and substrate-supported monolayer MoS2 are measured. These data, when combined with the first-order coefficients from laser power-dependent studies, enable the thermal conductivity to be extracted. The resulting thermal conductivity \u03ba = (34.5 \u00b1 4) W\/mK at room temperature agrees well with the first-principles lattice dynamics simulations. However, this value is significantly lower than that of graphene. The results from this work provide important input for the design of MoS2-based devices where thermal \u2026",

The low-energy optical conductivity in the paramagnetic-insulating state of these materials is characterized by a broad maximum near 1 eV. This feature shifts to lower energy and grows in optical oscillator strength as the temperature is lowered into the ferromagnetic state. It remains identifiable well below T c and transforms eventually into a Drude-like response. This optical behavior and the activated transport in the paramagnetic state of these materials are consistent with a Jahn-Teller small polaron. The optical spectra and oscillator strength changes compare well with models that include both double exchange and the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the description of the electronic structure.",

For the Ti 0.93 Co 0.07 O 2\u2212 \u03b4 sample, which exhibits a Curie temperature (T C) over 1180 K, we find the presence of 20\u201350 nm Co clusters as well as a small concentration of Co incorporated into the remaining matrix. After being subjected to the high-temperature anneal during the first magnetization measurement, the very same sample shows a T C\u223c 650 K and almost full matrix incorporation of Co. This T C is close to that of as-grown Ti 0.99 Co 0.01 O 2\u2212 \u03b4 sample (\u223c 700 K).

Although much is known about how such characteristics depend on nanotube chirality and diameter, relatively little is known about how the optical response depends on length, the next most obvious and fundamental nanotube trait. We show here that the intrinsic optical response of single-wall carbon nanotubes exhibits a strong dependence on nanotube length, and we offer a simple explanation that relates this behavior to the localization of a bound exciton along the length of a nanotube. The results presented here suggest that, for a given volume fraction, the longest nanotubes display significantly enhanced absorption, near-infrared fluorescence, and Raman scattering, which has important practical implications for potential applications that seek to exploit the \u2026",

            "In this contribution we demonstrate the effective separation of single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) species with diameters larger than 1 nm through multistage aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE), including isolation at the near-monochiral species level up to at least the diameter range of SWCNTs synthesized by electric arc synthesis (1.3\u20131.6 nm). We also demonstrate that refined species are readily obtained from both the metallic and semiconducting subpopulations of SWCNTs and that this methodology is effective for multiple SWCNT raw materials. Using these data, we report an empirical function for the necessary surfactant concentrations in the ATPE method for separating different SWCNTs into either the lower or upper phase as a function of SWCNT diameter. This empirical correlation enables predictive separation design and identifies a subset of SWCNTs that behave unusually as compared to other \u2026",
