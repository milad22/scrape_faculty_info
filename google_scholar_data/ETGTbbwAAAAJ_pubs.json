            "Most previously proposed statistical models for the indoor multipath channel include only time of arrival characteristics. However, in order to use statistical models in simulating or analyzing the performance of systems employing spatial diversity combining, information about angle of arrival statistics is also required. Ideally, it would be desirable to characterize the full spare-time nature of the channel. In this paper, a system is described that was used to collect simultaneous time and angle of arrival data at 7 GHz. Data processing methods are outlined, and results obtained from data taken in two different buildings are presented. Based on the results, a model is proposed that employs the clustered \"double Poisson\" time-of-arrival model proposed by Saleh and Valenzuela (1987). The observed angular distribution is also clustered with uniformly distributed clusters and arrivals within clusters that have a Laplacian \u2026",

            "Multiple antenna systems are a useful way of overcoming the effects of multipath interference, and can allow more efficient use of spectrum. In order to test the effectiveness of various algorithms such as diversity combining, phased array processing, and adaptive array processing in an indoor environment, a channel model is needed which models both the time and angle of arrival in indoor environments. Some data has been collected indoors and some temporal models have been proposed, but no existing model accounts for both time and angle of arrival. This paper discusses existing models for the time of arrival, experimental data (form the 6.75-7.25 GHz band) that were collected indoors, and a proposed extension of the Saleh-Valenzuela model (1987), which accounts for the angle of arrival. Model parameters measured in two different buildings are compared with the parameters presented in the paper by \u2026",

            "When implementing data encryption and decryption in a symmetric cryptosystem, secure distribution of the secret key to legitimate nodes can be a challenge. In this paper, we consider establishing secret keys using the common wireless channel, with particular emphasis on the spatial and temporal correlations of the channel coefficients. Specifically, we investigate the influence of channel correlation on the bound of the key size generated from the common channel using a simple single-input single-output channel model, and we verify the existence of a sampling approach able to generate a key using the minimum possible sampling window. We also explore decorrelation of the channel coefficients in a multiple-input multiple-output channel, and we use a statistical independence test to demonstrate that this process cannot be separated into spatial and temporal decorrelation processes. The insights gained from \u2026",
