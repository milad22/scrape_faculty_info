            "Systems with a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition in the vicinity of room temperature are useful for devices. Adjusting the ferroelectric transition temperature (T c) is traditionally accomplished by chemical substitution\u2014as in Ba x Sr 1-x TiO 3, the material widely investigated for microwave devices in which the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at GHz frequencies is tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field 1, 2. Heterogeneity associated with chemical substitution in such films, however, can broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees 3, which is detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance. An alternative way to adjust T c in ferroelectric films is strain 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we show that epitaxial strain from a newly developed substrate can be harnessed to increase T c by hundreds of degrees and produce room-temperature ferroelectricity in strontium titanate, a material that is not normally ferroelectric at \u2026",

Electronically, the situation is analogous to the q-2DEGs formed in semiconductor heterostructures by modulation doping. LaAlO 3\/SrTiO 3 heterostructures have recently been shown 10 to exhibit a hysteretic electric-field-induced metal\u2013insulator quantum phase transition for LaAlO 3 thicknesses of 3 unit cells. Here, we report the creation and erasure of nanoscale conducting regions at the interface between two insulating oxides, LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3. Using voltages applied by a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) probe, the buried LaAlO 3\/SrTiO 3 interface is locally and reversibly switched between insulating and conducting \u2026",

Only two Heisenberg gate operations are required to produce a controlled \u03c0-phase shift, compared to nineteen for exchange-only proposals employing three spins. Evolved from well-studied decoherence-free subspaces, this architecture inherits immunity from collective decoherence mechanisms. The simplicity and adaptability of this approach should make it attractive for spin-based quantum computing architectures.",

This qubit is remarkably insensitive to the placement and coupling anisotropy of spins within the cluster. One-and two-qubit quantum gates can be generated by magnetic fields and intercluster exchange, and leakage during quantum gate operation is small.
