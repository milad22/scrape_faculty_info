The model is a combination of the Kitaev honeycomb model and the Heisenberg model with all three nearest-neighbor couplings J 1, J 2, and J 3. A rich phase diagram is obtained at the classical level, including the experimentally suggested zigzag ordered phase; as well as the stripy phase, which extends from the Kitaev-Heisenberg limit to the J 1-J 2-J 3 one. Combining the experimentally observed spin order with the optimal fitting to the uniform magnetic susceptibility data gives an estimate of possible parameter values, which in turn reaffirms the necessity of including both the Kitaev and farther neighbor couplings.",

This model is known to have a spin-liquid ground state and may potentially be realized in correlated insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling. The effect of hole doping is studied within a t-J-J K model, treated using the SU (2) slave boson formalism, which correctly captures the parent spin liquid. We find superconductor ground states with spin triplet pairing that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Interestingly, the pairing is qualitatively different at low and high dopings, and undergoes a first-order transition with doping. At high dopings, it is smoothly connected to a paired state of electrons propagating with the underlying free particle dispersion. However, at low dopings the dispersion is strongly influenced by the \u2026",

We find that the boundary is thermalized and investigate how its boundary anomaly, dictated by the bulk SPT order, is encoded in the quantum chaotic eigenspectrum of the SYK model. We show that depending on the SPT symmetry class, the boundary many-body level statistics cycle in a systematic manner through those of the three different Wigner-Dyson random matrix ensembles with a periodicity in the topological index that matches the interaction-reduced classification of the bulk SPT states.

We define a SPT state as whether it is separated from the trivial state through a bulk phase transition, which is a general definition applicable to SPT states with or without spatial symmetries. We show that in all dimensions short-range interactions can reduce the classification of free-fermion SPT states, and we demonstrate these results by making a connection between the fermionic and bosonic SPT states. We first demonstrate that our formalism gives the correct classification for several known SPT states, with or without interaction, and then we generalize our method to SPT states that involve the spatial inversion symmetry.",

Here we construct a Z N rotor model that realizes a self-dual Z N Abelian gauge theory. We find that lattice dislocation defects in the model produce topologically protected degeneracy. Even though dislocations are not quasiparticle excitations, they resemble non-Abelian anyons with quantum dimension N. Exchanging dislocations can produce topologically protected projective non-Abelian geometric phases. Therefore, we discover a kind of (projective) non-Abelian anyon that appears as the dislocations in an Abelian Z N rotor model. These types of non-Abelian anyons can be viewed as a generalization of the Majorana zero modes.",

Changing the sign of one of these four-fermion perturbations leads to a continuous chaotic-nonchaotic quantum phase transition of the system accompanied by a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking.
