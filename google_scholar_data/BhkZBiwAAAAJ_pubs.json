            "Blasting has long been used as a ground improvement technique to densify loose granular soils. Explosives detonated at depth induce liquefaction in the target sand followed by pore pressure dissipation and attendant consolidation. Improvement typically is verified via measured surface settlements and increased penetration resistance with in situ tests such as the cone penetration test (CPT). However, an increase in penetration resistance is often not observed for months or even years after blasting. The results of instrumentation at a production blast zone at the Oakridge Landfill are reported herein. Instrumentation included surface settlements, pore pressure measurements inside and outside the blast zone, preblast and postblast piezocone () soundings, and gas concentrations of pore fluid. No increase in penetration resistance with the  was detected 53 days after the final blast, despite more than 0.5 m of settlement \u2026",

            "Results of a numerical finite-element (FE) simulation are presented to evaluate stress changes that affect the results of cone penetration tests (CPT) made at a test section after blast densification. The two-dimensional (2D) FE simulation was not used to predict liquefaction, as the pore-pressure distribution immediately after each blast and the extent of liquefaction, determined from field observations of ground-surface settlements and pore-pressure measurements, were an input rather than a result. A fully coupled FE formulation was employed to compute time-dependent deformations and stress changes that result from dissipation and seepage of input excess pore pressures. Computed results indicate stress levels within the targeted loose sand decrease near the edge of the blast zone as a result of stress redistributions that take place during reconsolidation, and likely contribute to decreased penetration resistance \u2026",

            "For more than 70 years, blast densification has been employed as a ground improvement technique to densify loose granular soils. Explosives are detonated at depth to induce liquefaction in the target sand and subsequent pore pressure dissipation causes the soil to consolidate into a denser configuration. Typically, improvement is verified via measured surface settlements and increased penetration resistance with in-situ tests, such as the standard penetration (SPT) or cone penetration test (CPT). However, often times no increase or a decrease in penetration resistance is observed, despite significant amounts of densification in the target sand layer. Researchers have suggested several theories for this paradox, including arching, decreased stress levels, destruction of cementation bonds, and the presence of gas released by the explosives. In some instances, a time-delay on the order of months or years was \u2026",

A soil arching mechanism and, often times, a geosynthetic reinforced load transfer platform partially transfers load to support columns beneath embankment and MSE wall fills. The mechanisms contributing to load transfer at the heads of columns has been the subject of extensive research for column-supported embankments. However, less attention has been given to the role of soil-column interaction at depth, and its influence on performance of these systems.

            "The introduction of nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases into the ground during blasting increases pore fluid compressibility and thus affects the postblast mechanical behavior of densified sand. This study presents the techniques used to sample pore fluid in situ with the BAT probe at a full-scale blast densification site. Special emphasis is given to the importance of preparing sample containers prior to collecting pore fluid. In addition, a methodology to evaluate gas concentrations and the degree of saturation in situ is provided. Measurements of postblast gas concentrations reveal that gas generated by explosives significantly increases both nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide concentrations relative to preblast levels. In addition, groundwater flow is likely responsible for increased gas concentrations outside the zone after a blast. However, nitrogen gas is responsible, almost exclusively, for the saturation of groundwater \u2026",

Three of the most significant flowslides, which occurred in the communities of Petobo, Jono Oge, and Lolu Village, were clustered within alluvial sediments of the Palu River Valley. Post-earthquake field reconnaissance, subsurface investigation, eyewitness interviews, and geomechanical analyses indicate that the failure sequence began when the earthquake ground motion raised pore water pressures in the saturated interbedded alluvial sediments. The flowslides were not coseismic but instead occurred several minutes after earthquake shaking ended. We hypothesize that high excess pore pressures created large hydraulic gradients within the alluvial sediments, which ultimately triggered progressive liquefaction \u2026",

Mechanical benefits associated with IPS are linked to the persistence of entrapped bubbles. Civil infrastructure operates for decades, often longer than a century, and thus the longevity of gas is a salient consideration for adoption of IPS in practice. Modeling the physical and chemical mechanisms that influence the persistence of entrapped bubbles is a practical avenue to address gas durability on these time scales, a limitation of physical experiments. The governing aqueous-phase advection-diffusion processes and interphase gas kinetics associated with bubble dissolution are simulated in a finite-difference numerical framework, validated with elemental and bench-scale experiments, and then extended to address soil resaturation rates under \u2026",
