            "Networks of cross-linked and bundled actin filaments are ubiquitous in the cellular cytoskeleton, but their elasticity remains poorly understood. We show that these networks exhibit exceptional elastic behavior that reflects the mechanical properties of individual filaments. There are two distinct regimes of elasticity, one reflectingbendingof single filaments and a second reflectingstretchingof entropic fluctuations of filament length. The mechanical stiffness can vary by several decades with small changes in cross-link concentration, and can increase markedly upon application of external stress. We parameterize the full range of behavior in a state diagram and elucidate its origin with a robust model.",

This compound possesses a low-frequency dielectric constant, \u03b5\u223c 10 4 [1], which is only weakly varying in the temperature range 100\u2013400 K. Below T\u223c 100 K, however, there is an abrupt 100-fold reduction in the value of \u03b5. X-ray diffraction and thermodynamic data argue against an explanation in terms of ferroelectricity, ie the collective ordering of local dipole moments.

For efficient movement, these processes must be spatiotemporally coordinated. To a large degree, the morphological changes and physical forces that occur during migration are generated by a dynamic filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. Adhesion is regulated by dynamic assemblies of structural and signaling proteins that couple the F-actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Here, we review current knowledge of the dynamic organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton in cell migration and the regulation of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly with an emphasis on how mechanical and biochemical signaling between these two systems regulate the coordination of physical processes in cell migration.",

Second, we present different improvements regarding standard methods for force reconstruction from the displacement field, which are the boundary element method, Fourier-transform traction cytometry, and traction reconstruction with point forces. Using extensive data simulation, we show that the spatial resolution of the boundary element method can be improved considerably by splitting the elastic field into near, intermediate \u2026",

In this paper, we demonstrate that the endogenous force sustained at the cell\u2013cell contact between a pair of epithelial cells is approximately 100 nN, directed perpendicular to the cell\u2013cell interface and concentrated at the contact edges. This force is stably maintained over time despite significant fluctuations in cell\u2013cell contact length and cell morphology. A direct relationship between the total cellular traction force on the ECM and the endogenous cell\u2013cell force exists, indicating that the cell\u2013cell tension is a constant fraction of the cell-ECM traction. Thus, modulation of ECM properties that impact cell-ECM traction alters cell\u2013cell tension. Finally, we show in a minimal model of a tissue that all cells experience similar forces \u2026",

Using combined traction force and fluorescent speckle microscopy, we observed a robust biphasic relationship between F-actin speed and traction force. F-actin speed is inversely related to traction stress near the cell edge where FAs are formed and F-actin motion is rapid. In contrast, larger FAs where the F-actin speed is low are marked by a direct relationship between F-actin speed and traction stress. We found that the biphasic switch is determined by a threshold F-actin speed of 8\u201310 nm\/s, independent of changes in FA protein density, age, stress magnitude, assembly\/disassembly status, or subcellular position induced by pleiotropic perturbations to Rho family guanosine triphosphatase signaling and myosin II activity.

            "We measure the viscoelasticity of entangled F-actin over length scales between 1 and 100 \u03bc m using one-and two-particle microrheology, and directly identify two distinct microscopic contributions to the elasticity. Filament entanglements lead to a frequency-independent elastic modulus over an extended frequency range of 0.01\u201330 r a d\/sec\ufeff; this is probed with one-particle microrheology. Longitudinal fluctuations of the filaments increase the elastic modulus between 0.1 and 30 r a d\/sec\ufeff at length scales up to the filament persistence length; this is probed by two-particle microrheology.",
