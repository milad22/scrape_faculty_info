            "We examine the investment behavior of firms before and after being spun off from their parent companies. Their investment after the spin\u2010off is significantly more sensitive to measures of investment opportunities (e.g., industry Tobin's Q or industry investment) than it is before the spin\u2010off. Spin\u2010offs tend to cut investment in low Q industries and increase investment in high Q industries. These changes are observed primarily in spin\u2010offs of firms in industries unrelated to the parents' industries and in spin\u2010offs where the stock market reacts favorably to the spin\u2010off announcement. Our findings suggest that spin\u2010offs may improve the allocation of capital.",

Using a standard structural model, we calculate the optimal make-whole call premium, i.e. the make-whole premium that maximizes the ex-ante firm value subject to managers following a second-best call policy that maximizes the ex-post equity value. For reasonable parameterizations, optimal make-whole premiums are relatively close to 15% of the model-generated credit spread.

            "From August 2005 to December 2008, a total of 54 warrants were issued in China. Trading in China's warrant market was extremely active \u2014 on a daily basis, turnover often exceeded one. Using three standard pricing models, we document that put warrant market prices averaged 1.2 yuan more than model-generated prices, while call warrant prices averaged 1.9 yuan less. Financial institutions that were authorized to create new warrants exploited these pricing anomalies and generated 20 billion yuan (over $3 billion) in creating overpriced put warrants. We identify two important factors that explain the mispricing. First, we show that the P\/E ratios of underlying stocks are related to the overpricing of put warrants and the underpricing of call warrants. This suggests that investors took the potential burst of a stock market bubble into account and thus imposed an implicit discount on the value of stocks when pricing \u2026",
