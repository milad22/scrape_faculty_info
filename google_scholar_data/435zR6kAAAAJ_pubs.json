            "We present a description, including relevant formulas and numerical estimates, of a set of polarization transfer experiments which appear to offer a feasible way to separate the deuteron charge and quadrupole form factors and measure the neutron and proton electric form factors. The experiments require a 2 to 4 GeV high-intensity, high-duty factor, longitudinally polarized electron beam and require that the polarization of the recoiling hadron be measured in a second, analyzing, scattering. The relevant asymmetries are fairly large, and our calculations show that they are sensitive to different models obtained from existing data. Attention is called to the fact that the proposed deuteron measurements will require new 10% measurements of vector and tensor analyzing powers of deuterons with kinetic energy from 150 to 450 MeV.",

If I tried to do justice to all the models and interesting technical developments of the la~ t year, I would be here all day. Instead, I will concentrate on a class of models which I think is one of the most amusing developments in gauge theories since the Weinberg model, the class of unified theories of the weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions. By this I mean gauge models describing the weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions in terms of a single gauge coupling constant, so that the gauge group of the world is either simple or a product of isomorphic simple factors. At first hearing, the whole idea sounds like nonsense. How can a single gauge coupling describe the weak and electromagnetic interactions, which are presumably characterized by dimensionless coupling constants of order e, and the strong \u2026",

The formulas are given as double integrals over the deuteron wave functions in momentum space, and hence can be evaluated for any deuteron model. We evaluate these formulas numerically for 9 different deuteron models: Reid soft core, two Lomon-Feshbach models, three Holinde-Machleidt models, and three four-component relativistic models. All of the models give results for the A structure function considerably below the experimental results; the effect of the relativistic treatment is to reduce the size of A by a factor of 2 to 5 at Q 2 of 100 fm\u2212 2 over what it would be in the nonrelativistic approximation.

            "Jur\u010do, M\u00f6ller, Schraml, Schupp, and Wess have shown how to construct noncommutative SU(N) gauge theories from a consistency relation. Within this framework, we present the Feynman rules for noncommutative QCD and compute explicitly the most dangerous Lorentz-violating operator generated through radiative corrections. We find that interesting effects appear at the one-loop level, in contrast to conventional noncommutative U(N) gauge theories, leading to a stringent bound. Our results are consistent with others appearing recently in the literature that suggest collider limits are not competitive with low-energy tests of Lorentz violation for bounding the scale of spacetime noncommutativity.",

            "We present a consistent and unified study of the spectrum of low-lying mesons, baryons, and glueballs using the MIT bag model, incorporating several improvements in the model. We correct for the center-of-mass motion, use a running coupling \u03b1 s (R), include self-energy terms for quarks and gluons confined in a cavity, and get the bag constant from a model of the QCD vacuum. Our fit to the meson and baryon spectrum, including the pion, is good and predictions for the glueball spectrum are given.",
