Two instruments are presented:(i) a high-speed flexure stage arrangement capable of imaging at a video rate of 30 fps, and (ii) an ultra-high speed instrument using a combined tuning fork and flexure-stage scanning system capable of ultra-high-speed imaging in excess of 1000 fps.

Here we demonstrate the true dissolution of a wide range of important 2D nanomaterials by forming layered material salts that spontaneously dissolve in polar solvents yielding ionic solutions. The benign dissolution advantageously maintains the morphology of the starting material, is stable against reaggregation and can achieve solutions containing exclusively individualized monolayers. Importantly, the charge on the anionic nanosheet solutes is reversible, enables targeted deposition over large areas via electroplating and can initiate novel self-assembly upon drying.

However, the technique is limited by very low sample throughput and temporal resolution making it impractical for materials science research on macro sized or time evolving samples such as the observation of corrosion. The potential of AFM sparked intense efforts to overcome these limitations shortly after its invention, and has led to the development of high-speed atomic force microscopes (HS-AFMs). Within the last 5 years the technology underpinning these instruments has matured to the point where routine imaging can achieve megapixels per second over scan areas of square millimetres, removing the limitations from AFM for industrial scale materials characterisation.

The resolution of this method is tested using different cantilever sizes and a theoretical model is developed to maximize the detection sensitivity. The applications presented here clearly show that the SEW detection system enables the use of force sensors with sub-micron size, opening new possibilities in the investigation of biomolecular systems and high speed imaging.
