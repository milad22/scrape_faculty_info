            "In correlated metals derived from Mott insulators, the motion of an electron is impeded by Coulomb repulsion due to other electrons. This phenomenon causes a substantial reduction in the electron\u2019s kinetic energy, leading to remarkable experimental manifestations in optical spectroscopy 1. The high-transition-temperature (T c) superconducting cuprates are perhaps the most studied examples of such correlated metals. The occurrence of high-T c superconductivity in the iron pnictides 2, 3, 4 puts a spotlight on the relevance of correlation effects in these materials 5. Here, we present an infrared and optical study on single crystals of the iron pnictide superconductor LaFePO. We find clear evidence of electronic correlations in metallic LaFePO with the kinetic energy of the electrons reduced to half of that predicted by band theory of nearly free electrons. We deduce that electronic many-body effects are important in the \u2026",

As a function of pressure, superconductivity is observed to onset above 11 GPa with a transition temperature T c and upper critical field H c 2 that both increase with pressure up to 30 GPa, where they reach maximum values of 7 K and 4 T, respectively. Upon further pressure increase, T c remains anomalously constant up to the highest achieved pressure. Conversely, the carrier concentration increases continuously with pressure, including a tenfold increase over the pressure range where T c remains constant. Together with a quasilinear temperature dependence of H c 2 that exceeds the orbital and Pauli limits, the anomalously stagnant pressure dependence of T c points to an unconventional pressure-induced pairing state in Bi 2 Se 3 that is \u2026",

Electrical resistivity measurements reveal metallic behavior and a resistive transition to the superconducting state at a critical temperature T c~ 6.6 K. Magnetization measurements also show the onset of superconductivity near 6 K. In contrast, specific heat measurements manifest no discontinuity at T c. These results lend support to the conclusion that the superconductivity is associated with oxygen vacancies that alter the carrier concentration in a small fraction of the sample, although superconductivity characterized by an unusually small gap value cannot be ruled out. Under applied magnetic fields, T c is suppressed anisotropically for fields perpendicular and parallel to the ab-plane, suggesting that the crystalline anisotropy strongly influences the superconducting state.

The pressure dependence of T c differs substantially from that observed in previous studies under quasihydrostatic pressure to 30 GPa. Remarkably, the dependence of T c on relative volume V\u2215 V o is nearly linear over the entire pressure range above 33 GPa, implying that higher values of T c are likely at higher pressures.

Evidence is presented that the differing values of dTc\/dP reported in the literature may result primarily from shear-stress effects in nonhydrostatic pressure media rather than from differences in the samples.
