            "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone. Analysis of familial cancer syndromes and sporadic cases has strongly implicated both p53 and pRb in its pathogenesis; however, the relative contribution of these mutations to the initiation of osteosarcoma is unclear. We describe here the generation and characterization of a genetically engineered mouse model in which all animals develop short latency malignant osteosarcoma. The genetically engineered mouse model is based on osteoblast-restricted deletion of p53 and pRb. Osteosarcoma development is dependent on loss of p53 and potentiated by loss of pRb, revealing a dominance of p53 mutation in the development of osteosarcoma. The model reproduces many of the defining features of human osteosarcoma including cytogenetic complexity and comparable gene expression signatures, histology, and metastatic behavior.

His previous infusions were uneventful and demonstrated normal MTX clearance. Prior to the fourth HDMTX infusion, he had an unremarkable examination (weight, 55kg; surface area, 1.59 m2). Laboratory investigations showed normal electrolytes, liver function, and kidney function (serum creatinine [Cr] 0.8 mg\/dl; normal for age 1.0 mg\/dl). During infusion (12 gm\/m2 over 4 h, total 20 g), the patient developed severe nausea and vomiting.

The 24-hr post-infusion studies revealed persistently elevated MTX level (424 \u03bcM; target level< 10 \u03bcM), worsening renal function (Cr 2.3 mg\/dl), and evidence of hepatic injury (ALT 1,240 IU\/L, total bilirubin 4.2 mg\/dl, INR 2.06). He was started on 1,000 mg\/m2 of leucovorin, intravenously every 6 hr.Due to the unavailability of a standard dose of carboxypeptidase-G2 (CPG2)(50 U\/kg)[1], the patient only received 18 U\/kg (total 1,000 U, single vial), or approximately one-third of the standard dose. One hour post-administration, the MTX level decreased to 58\u03bcM, measured by automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPI), detection limit 0.02 \u03bcM.
