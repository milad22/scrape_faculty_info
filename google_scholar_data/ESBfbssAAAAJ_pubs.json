            "We compare the phase behavior of a mutant filamentous virus, fd Y21M, to that of a conventional fd wild-type (wt). We find significantly different macroscopic phase behavior despite the only microscopic difference between the two viruses being in a single amino acid of the major coat protein pVIII. Compared to fd wt, the location of the isotropic\u2013cholesteric phase transition for fd Y21M shifts to lower densities. This is attributable to a significant difference in the flexibility of the two viruses. The persistence length of fd wt is 2.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5m, whereas the persistence length of fd Y21M is 9.9 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b5m. The large persistence length of fd Y21M makes it an essentially rigid rod, thus allowing for the first time a quantitative test of the Onsager theory for the isotropic\u2013nematic phase transition. Even more striking, is the difference in the chiral phase behavior of the two viruses. Both viruses form cholesteric phases, with the fd wt forming a \u2026",

However, it remains challenging to realize the 3D topological conditions necessary to robustly and arbitrarily direct the formation of defects. Here, using a series of short pillar arrays as topological templates, we demonstrate the hierarchical assembly of focal conic domains (FCDs) in smectic-A liquid crystals that break the underlying symmetry of the pillar lattice, exhibit tunable eccentricity, and together develop a nontrivial yet organized array of defects. The key to our approach lies in the selection of the appropriate ratio of the size of focal domain to the dimension of pillars such that the system favors the \u201cpinning\u201d of FCD centers near pillar edges while avoiding the opposing effect of confinement.

For cylinder, microbullet, and cube colloid geometries, we obtain the particles' equilibrium alignment directions and effective pair interaction potentials as a function of simple shape parameters. We find that defects pin at sharp edges, and that the colloid consequently orients at an oblique angle relative to the far-field nematic director that depends on the colloid's shape.
