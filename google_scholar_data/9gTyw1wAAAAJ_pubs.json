            "The first studies on the clinical use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) with contrast specific imaging techniques were published at the beginning of this century using Levovist\u00ae as UCA [1, 2]. A couple of years later sulphur hexafluoride (Sono-Vue\u00ae, Bracco, Milan) was marketed in Europe, opening the era of real time low mechanical index (MI) contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) released the first Guidelines on the use of CEUS in 2004 [3]. This document, which focused mainly on liver applications, contributed to the rapid expansion of CEUS and sanctioned the acronym \u201cCEUS\u201d. CEUS was felt to be a revolutionary technique and many new applications, besides those in the liver, were developed in the following years. Therefore, in the update of the Clinical Recommendations on the use of CEUS by the EFSUMB, published in 2008 [4], applications in some other organs were described. Since then, there has been exponentially increasing interest in the clinical applications of CEUS and new fields have been investigated, so that nearly all organ systems have now been subjected to some kind of CEUS study. More than half of the approximately 900 original investigative articles (editorials and letters excluded) found in PubMed\u00ae under the search term \u201cContrast Enhanced Ultrasound\u201d by the end of 2010 were published after 2008, after the last update of the EFSUMB guidelines [4]. Therefore, in 2010 EFSUMB felt it was the right time to start preparing a new update of the Guidelines. In the light of the expansion in CEUS usage, it was felt that a new update \u2026",

To circumvent these limitations, the method presented in this paper uses 3 techniques: 1) The ultrasound is not focused during the transmissions of the ultrasound signals; 2) A 13 -bit Barker code is transmitted simultaneously from each transducer element; and 3) The 2-D vector velocity of the blood is estimated using 2-D cross-correlation. A parameter study was performed using the Field II program, and performance of the method was investigated when a virtual blood vessel was scanned by a linear array transducer. An improved parameter set for the method was identified from the parameter study, and a flow rig measurement was performed using the same improved setup as in the simulations. Finally, the \u2026",

All patients were interviewed and asked specifically about impairment of flatus or fecal control and its possible relation to the anal dilatation. Anal dilatation was followed by minor anal incontinence in 12.5 percent of the patients. Anal endosonographic follow-up was accepted by 20 patients, and sphincteric defects were found in 13 (65 percent) of those. Two patients with anal incontinence had internal sphincter defects. Sphincteric defects were also found in 11 of the 18 continent patients who underwent sonography: internal sphincter defects in nine, external sphincter defect in one, and combined defects of both sphincter muscles in one.

            "The aim of this paper is to describe the efficacy of ultrasound-guided drainage of breast abscesses with special attention to the risk of recurrence and the need for surgical treatment in a consecutive patient population. 151 patients, 89 with puerperal and 62 with non-puerperal breast abscesses, were treated with ultrasound-guided drainage, by needle or catheter under local anaesthesia. Follow-up punctures were performed at 2 or 3 day intervals until the clinical condition and ultrasound findings had improved. All patients were treated with oral antibiotics. Mammography was performed to search for underlying cancer. 86 (97%) out of 89 patients with puerperal abscesses and 50 (81%) out of 62 with non-puerperal abscesses recovered after the first round of ultrasound-guided drainage. One patient in each group had recurrence in loco but recovered after further ultrasound-guided drainage. 13 patients, 11 with non \u2026",

Endosonography was normal in ten patients, of whom one was incontinent. The examination showed a defect in the external anal sphincter in 13 patients; six of these were incontinent, two of whom had normal findings on palpation. An isolated internal sphincter defect was found in a continent patient. Since anal endosonography causes no more discomfort than digital examination, it may be useful to identify patients who would benefit from surgical reconstruction of the anal sphincter.",
