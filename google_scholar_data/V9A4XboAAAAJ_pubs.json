            "Recent technological advances in the development of fast digital signal processors have made the active control of sound a practical proposition. This book brings together results from research in the two disciplinesof acoustics and signal processing and presents the fundamentals of noise control in a unified manner. Practical applications are presented wherever possible although the emphasis is on the algorithmic principles which form the foundation of practical systems. The volume is written in textbook style and aimed at both undergraduate and postgraduate students of acoustics and signal processing, professional acoustical and electrical engineers, and researchers in the field of active control.",

            "This book is a companion text to Active Control of Sound by PA Nelson and SJ Elliott, also published by Academic Press. It summarizes the principles underlying active vibration control and its practical applications by combining material from vibrations, mechanics, signal processing, acoustics, and control theory. The emphasis of the book is on the active control of waves in structures, the active isolation of vibrations, the use of distributed strain actuators and sensors, and the active control of structurally radiated sound. The feedforward control of deterministic disturbances, the active control of structural waves and the active isolation of vibrations are covered in detail, as well as the more conventional work on modal feedback. The principles of the transducers used as actuateors and sensors for such control strategies are also given an in-depth description. The reader will find particularly interesting the two chapters on the active control of sound radiation from structures: active structural acoustic control. The reason for controlling high frequency vibration is often to prevent sound radiation, and the principles and practical application of such techniques are presented here for both plates and cylinders. The volume is written in textbook style and is aimed at students, practicing engineers, and researchers. Combines material from vibrations, signal processing, mechanics, and controls Summarizes new research in the field",

            "Active noise control exploits the long wavelengths associated with low frequency sound. It works on the principle of destructive interference between the sound fields generated by the original primary sound source and that due to other secondary sources, acoustic outputs of which can be controlled. The acoustic objectives of different active noise control systems and the electrical control methodologies that are used to achieve these objectives are examined. The importance of having a clear understanding of the principles behind both the acoustics and the electrical control in order to appreciate the advantages and limitations of active noise control is emphasized. A brief discussion of the physical basis of active sound control that concentrates on three-dimensional sound fields is presented.< >",

The algorithm uses the instantaneous gradient of the total error, and for a single filter and error reduces to the \"filtered x LMS\" algorithm. The application of this algorithm to active sound and vibration control is discussed, by which suitably driven secondary sources are used to reduce the levels of acoustic or vibrational fields by minimizing the sum of the squares of a number of error sensor signals. A practical implementation of the algorithm is presented for the active control of sound at a single frequency. The algorithm converges on a timescale comparable to the response time of the system to be controlled, and is found to be very robust. If the pure tone reference signal is synchronously sampled, it is \u2026",

It is assumed that a number of acoustic sources are located at known spatial positions and that the acoustic pressure is measured at a number of spatial positions in the radiated field. The transfer functions relating the strengths of the acoustic sources to the radiated pressures are also assumed known. In principle, the strengths of the acoustic sources can be deduced from the measured acoustic pressures by inversion of this matrix of transfer functions. The accuracy of source strength reconstruction (in the presence of noise which contaminates the measured pressures) is crucially dependent on the conditioning of the matrix to be inverted. This paper examines the conditioning of this inverse problem, particularly with regard to the geometry and number of sources and measurement positions and the non-dimensional frequency.

Two loudspeaker distributions, which were either evenly distributed or partly concentrated in the plane of the propellers, gave similar reductions in the sum of the squares of the measured pressures at the fundamental blade passage frequency (88 Hz) of about 13 dB. Concentrating the loudspeakers near the propeller plane increased the reductions in the second and third harmonics (176 Hz and 264 Hz) from about 9 dB and 6 dB respectively for the equally distributed system, to about 12 dB for both harmonics.

Such an equalization filter can give a more uniform frequency response over a greater volume of the enclosure than a filter designed to equalize at one point only. The results of computer simulations are presented for equalization in a\" room\" with dimensions and acoustic damping typical of a car interior, using various algorithms to adapt automatically the coefficients of a digital equalization filter.",

            "An analysis is presented of the effectiveness with which active methods can be used for producing global reductions in the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations in a harmonically excited enclosed sound field. The total time averaged acoustic potential energy is expressed as a quadratic function of the complex strengths of a number of secondary sources of sound introduced into the enclosure. For a given number and location of secondary sources, there is a unique set of source strengths which determines the minimum value of this function. The analysis is applied to the case of a lightly damped enclosure excited by a point primary source at a frequency above the Schroeder cut-off frequency. It is demonstrated that substantial reductions in the total time averaged acoustic potential energy are possible only if the secondary sources of sound are located at a distance from the primary source which is less than half a \u2026",
