Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface. Finally, we highlight \u2026",

Here, we show that the magnetoresistance (MR) of this Cooper pair insulator (CPI) phase is positive and grows exponentially with decreasing temperature T, for T well below the pair formation temperature. It peaks at a field estimated to be sufficient to break the pairs and then decreases monotonically into a regime in which the film resistance assumes the T dependence appropriate for weakly localized single electron transport. We discuss how these results support proposals that the large MR peaks in other unpatterned, ultrathin film systems disclose a CPI phase and provide new insight into the CP localization.",

This Cooper-pair insulator (CPI) state is achieved in amorphous Bi films evaporated onto substrates with a topography varying on lengths slightly greater than the superconducting coherence length. We present evidence that this topography induces film thickness and corresponding superconducting coupling constant variations that promote Cooper-pair island formation. Analyses of many thickness-tuned ISTs show that weak links between superconducting islands dominate the transport. In particular, the IST occurs when the link resistance approaches the resistance quantum for pairs. These results support conjectures that the CPI is an inhomogeneous state of matter.",

            "We present investigations of the superconductor-to-insulator transition (SIT) of uniform a-Bi films using a technique sensitive to Cooper pair phase coherence. The films are perforated with a nanohoneycomb array of holes to form a multiply connected geometry and subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. Film magnetoresistances on the superconducting side of the SIT oscillate with a period dictated by the superconducting flux quantum and the areal hole density. The oscillations disappear close to the SIT critical point to leave a monotonically rising magnetoresistance that persists in the insulating phase. These observations indicate that the Cooper pair phase coherence length, which is infinite in the superconducting phase, collapses to a value less than the interhole spacing at this SIT. This behavior is inconsistent with the gradual reduction of the phase coherence length expected for a bosonic phase \u2026",

Because BP devices rely on exfoliation from bulk crystals, there is a need to understand the native impurities and defects in the source material. In particular, samples are typically p-doped, but the source of the doping is not well understood. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to compare the atomic defects of BP samples from two commercial sources. Even though the sources produced crystals with an order of magnitude difference in impurity atoms, we observed a similar defect density and level of p-doping. We attribute these defects to phosphorus vacancies and provide evidence that they are the source of p-doping. We also compare these native defects to those induced by air exposure and show that they are distinct and likely more important for the \u2026",

We find that the Rydberg-like series of image potential states is shifted toward lower energy over the graphene islands relative to Cu (111), indicating a decrease in the local work function, and the resonances have a much smaller linewidth, indicating reduced coupling to the bulk. In addition, we show the dispersion of the occupied Cu (111) Shockley surface state is influenced by the graphene layer, and both the band edge and effective mass are shifted relative to bare Cu (111).",
