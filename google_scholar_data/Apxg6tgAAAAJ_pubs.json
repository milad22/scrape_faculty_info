In classical situations [20], a Harnack inequality for positive solutions was established locally. However, the geometric dependency of the estimates is complicated and sometimes unclear. Our goal is to prove a Harnack inequality for positive solutions of (0.1)(w 2) by utilizing a gradient estimate derived in w 1. The method of proof is originated in [26] and [8], where they have studied the elliptic case, ie the solution is time independent. In some situations (Theorems 2.2 and",

It turns out that this classification can also be described in terms of curvature of a certain complete Riemannian metric which induces the conformal structure on this surface. In fact, a theorem of Blanc-Fiala-Huber [2] says that a complete two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with non-negative curvature does not admit a non-constant bounded harmonic function. On the other hand, a theorem of Ahlfors states that a complete simply connected two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with curvature bounded from above by a negative constant does admit a non-constant bounded harmonic function.

            "The Yang-Mills equations were introduced by theoretical physicists and are now accepted as a basic ingredient in particle theory. In the past decade these equations have become important in mathematics in two separate areas. It was observed early on that the twistor formalism of Penrose and the Atiyah-Singer index theory can be employed to good purpose in order to describe special solutions, called anti-selfdual solutions; see [29],[3]. Using techniques of algebraic geometry, Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin [2] were able to describe all such solutions over S4 (or W4) in terms of holomorphic bundles on CP3. More recently a simpler description using stable vector bundles was obtained by Donaldson [81. The techniques of partial differential equations were used by Taubes [25],[26] to construct solutions on arbitrary four-manifolds. These results and compactness theorems of the first author were incorporated into a \u2026",

            "Most of the problems in differential geometry can be reduced to problems in differential equations on Riemannian manifolds. Our main purpose here is to study these equations and their applications in geometry. In Section 1, we prove that if the volume of the geodesic balls of a complete Riemannian manifold grows at most like a quadratic polynomial, then there is no non-trivial positive superharmonic function defined on this manifold. In fact, a more precise quantitative result is obtained. We apply this to prove a Bernstein type theorem: If H is a function of the same sign defined on R3 with aH\/aX,= aHfaXz= O and aH\/aX, SO, then there is no graph defined on R2 whose mean curvature at each point is given by H. In Section 2, we simplify a proof of the \u201cmaximal principle\u201d in [9] and give some applications. For example, if M is a complete Riemannian manifold such that outside a compact set the Ricci curvature is \u2026",
