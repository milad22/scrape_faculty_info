If the symmetry breaking is such that they are massless or light, they probably combine with quarks to form families of new, relatively low-lying hadrinic states, which decay into ordinary hadrons and a new, neutrino-like particle. We discuss how present experiments can put limits on their production.",

A similar scaling law is obtained for large-p\u22a5 inclusive scattering. When the quark model is used to specify n, we find good agreement with experiments. For instance, this accounts naturally for the (q 2)\u2212 2 asymptotic behavior of the proton form factor. We examine in detail the field-theoretic foundations of the scaling laws and the assumption which needs to be made about the short-distance and infrared behavior of a bound state.",

The two spectra are combined addressing the systematic uncertainties and, in particular, the influence of the energy resolution on the spectral shape. The spectrum can be described by a broken power law E\u2212 \u03b3 with index \u03b3= 3.3 below the ankle which is measured at log 10 (E ankle\/eV)= 18.6. Above the ankle the spectrum is described by a power law with index 2.6 followed by a flux suppression, above about log 10 (E\/eV)= 19.5, detected with high statistical significance.",
