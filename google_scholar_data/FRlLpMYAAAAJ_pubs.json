            "Nanoscale Fe0 particles are a promising technology for in situ remediation of trichloroethene (TCE) plumes and TCE-DNAPL source areas, but the physical and chemical properties controlling their reactivity are not yet understood. Here, the TCE reaction rates, pathways, and efficiency of two nanoscale Fe0 particles are measured in batch reactors:\u2009 particles synthesized from sodium borohydride reduction of ferrous iron (Fe\/B) and commercially available particles (RNIP). Reactivity was determined under iron-limited (high [TCE]) and excess iron (low [TCE]) conditions and with and without added H2. Particle efficiency, defined as the fraction of the Fe0 in the particles that is used to dechlorinate TCE, was determined under iron-limited conditions. Both particles had a core\/shell structure and similar specific surface areas (\u223c30 m2\/g). Using excess iron, Fe\/B transformed TCE into ethane (80%) and C3\u2212C6 coupling \u2026",

            "Magnetism is a very fascinating and dynamic field. Especially in the last 30 years, there have been many major advances in a range of areas from novel fundamental phenomena to new products. Applications such as hard disc drives and magnetic sensors are part of our daily life and new applications, such as in non-volatile computer random access memory, are expected to surface shortly. Thus it is an opportune time for describing the current status and current and future challenges in the form of a roadmap article. The 2014 Magnetism Roadmap provides a view on several selected, presently very active innovative developments. It consists of twelve sections, each written by an expert in the field and addressing a specific subject, with a strong emphasis on future potential.",

These superparamagnetic monodisperse charged polystyrene particles containing nanoscale iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized through emulsion polymerization. They self-assemble into crystalline colloidal arrays (CCAs) in deionized water and Bragg diffract visible light. The diffraction from these superparamagnetic CCAs can be controlled by imposition of magnetic fields, which readily alter the CCA lattice constant. We also observe magnetically induced self-assembly of these superparamagnetic particles into CCAs in media such as NaCl aqueous solutions and organic polar solvents, which normally do not permit spontaneous CCA self-assembly. We also find that magnetic fields can strain the face-centered cubic lattice \u2026",

            "The morphology and crystalline microstructure of carbon-encapsulated nanoparticles produced in a Huffman-Kr\u00e4tschmer fullerene reactor are studied systematically as a function of location within the reactor. X-ray powder diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy are used to characterize powder harvested from the reactor walls and the inner and outer cores of the cathode deposit. We observe increased graphitization and crystallinity, more faceting, and more gaps between the nanoparticle and the encapsulating carbon cages in the cathode deposit when compared to the wall powder. We propose a growth model based on gas-phase nucleation to explain these observations, linking carbon arc nanoparticle synthesis to existing work on gas aggregation cluster sources.",

            "Carbon-coated gadolinium carbide nanocrystallites are generated by a process based on the Kratschmer-Huffman carbon-arc method of preparing fullerenes, and a novel magnetic-field-gradient separation technique is used to separate them. This separation of nanocrystalline byproducts of the carbon arc process is a prerequisite for many of the proposed applications of these materials. While the data presented pertain to Gd 2 C 3, this method is generally applicable to any paramagnetic or ferromagnetic compound. Structural characterization by x-ray and electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of a single gadolinium-containing (Gd 2 C 3) phase and excess carbon. The carbide phase exists as 10\u201350 nm spherical particles. SQUID magnetometry shows paramagnetic response attributed to Gd 3+ ions.",
