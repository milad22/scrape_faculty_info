            "Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability\u2014in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the \u2018chicken and egg problem\u2019. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like \u2026",

We argue that the effective interactions in both channels logarithmically flow toward the same values at low energies; ie, antiferromagnetism and superconductivity must be treated on equal footing. The magnetic instability comes first for equal sizes of the two pockets, but loses to superconductivity upon doping. The superconducting gap has no nodes, but changes sign between the two Fermi surfaces (extended s-wave symmetry). We argue that the T dependencies of the spin susceptibility and NMR relaxation rate for such a state are exponential only at very low T, and can be well fitted by power laws over a wide T range below T c.",

In this regime, d-wave superconductivity can emerge from repulsive electron\u2013electron interactions. Using a renormalization group method, we argue that superconductivity dominates over all competing orders for generic weak repulsive interactions.

The variety of different pairing states raises the issue of whether the physics of FeSCs is model dependent or is universal, governed by a single underlying pairing mechanism.

            "A Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagom\u00e9 lattice is highly degenerate in the classical limit. I show that quantum fluctuations lift the degeneracy and yeild the low-energy branch of spin-wave excitations with a velocity which is a factor S\u2212 1\/3 smaller than for conventional spin waves. The relevance of these results to the experiments on the stacked kagom\u00e9 antiferromagnet SrCr 8\u2212 x Ga 4+ x O 19 is discussed.",
