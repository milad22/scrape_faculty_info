            "High-quality alkyl monolayers on silicon have been prepared from 1-alkenes and hydrogen-terminated Si (lll). The 1-alkenes form monolayers upon free-radicalinitiation with diacyl peroxides. Heat also initiates monolayer formation, although monolayers prepared from heated long-chain 1-alkenes are of lower quality than those prepared with free-radical initiation. Even when a high concentration of diacyl peroxide is used to initiate monolayer formation, the 1-alkene is the primary constituent of the monolayer. Alkynes also form monolayers on silicon when initiated by diacyl-peroxides. X-ray reflectivity shows that the monolayer thickness is of molecular dimensions and that the density is close to that of crystalline hydrocarbons (~ 90%). Infrared spectroscopyshows that the alkyl chains in the monolayers are densely packed. Infrared dichroism shows that the chains are tilted from the surfacenormal and twisted about \u2026",

Illumination of H\u2212Si(111) in air with ultraviolet light of wavelength of 350 nm or shorter produces oxidized silicon; longer wavelengths cause no oxidation. When H\u2212Si(111) is immersed in unsaturated hydrocarbons (1-octene, 1-octadecene, 1-octyne, styrene, and phenylacetylene) that have been deoxygenated, illumination with a Hg lamp results in densely packed hydrocarbon films of molecular thickness. Previous work and the results presented here suggest that the H\u2212Si bond adds across the unsaturated bond in these reactions similar to hydrosilylation reactions known for small-molecule chemistry and produce adsorbates covalently bonded to the surface. We present spectroscopic evidence showing films resulting from terminal acetylenes consist of adsorbates linked to the surface by a vinyl group. We propose \u2026",

The reaction also works well for \u03c9-functionalized 1-alkenes, provided that the functional group is properly protected. After formation of the monolayer, the protecting group can be easily removed without noticeable disturbance of the monolayer integrity, and the now reactive sites at the monolayer can be used for further functionalization, as has been shown in the case of ester-protected alcohol and carboxylic acids.

            "The bonding of alkyl monolayers to Si(111) surfaces has been studied with high-resolution core level photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). Two very different wet-chemical methods have been used to prepare the alkyl monolayers: (i) Olefin insertion into the H\u2013Si bond of the H\u2013Si(111) surface, and (ii) replacement of Cl on the Cl\u2013Si(111) surface by an alkyl group from an alkyllithium reagent. In both cases, PES has revealed a C 1s component shifted to lower binding energy and a Si 2p component shifted to higher binding energy. Both components are attributed to the presence of a C\u2013Si bond at the interface. Along with photoelectron diffraction data [Appl. Phys. Lett. 71, 1056, (1997)], these data are used to show that these two synthetic methods can be used to functionalize the Si(111) surface.",

            "Covalently bonded monolayers of two monofunctional aminosilanes (3-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane, APDMES, and 3-aminopropyldiisopropylethoxysilane, APDIPES) and one trifunctional aminosilane (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES) have been deposited on dehydrated silicon substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 150 \u00b0C and low pressure (a few Torr) using reproducible equipment. Standard surface analytical techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle goniometry, spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) have been employed to characterize the resulting films. These methods indicate that essentially constant surface coverages are obtained over a wide range of gas phase concentrations of the aminosilanes. XPS data further indicate that the N1s\/Si2p ratio is higher after CVD with the \u2026",
