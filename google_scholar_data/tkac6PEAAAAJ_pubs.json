            "This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \u039bCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted \u201cbase \u039bCDM\u201d in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 \u00b1 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter \u03a9m = 0.308 \u00b1 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 \u00b1 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis.

            "This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (\u2113 \u2273 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter \u039bCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be \u03b8\u2217 = (1.04147 \u00b1 0.00062) \u00d7 10-2, \u03a9bh2 = 0.02205 \u00b1 0.00028, \u03a9ch2 = 0.1199 \u00b1 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 \u00b1 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters).

These maps provide an accurate rendition of the sky emission at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857GHz with an angular resolution ranging from 9.\u03017 to 4.\u03016. The detector noise per (effective) beam solid angle is respectively, 10, 6 , 12, and 39\u2009\u03bcK in the four lowest HFI frequency channels (100\u2212353GHz) and 13 and 14\u2009kJy sr-1 in the 545 and 857\u2009GHz channels. Relative to the 143\u2009GHz channel, these two high frequency channels are calibrated to within 5% and the 353\u2009GHz channel to the percent level. The 100 and 217\u2009GHz channels, which together with the 143\u2009GHz channel determine the high-multipole part of the CMB power spectrum (50 <\u2113 < 2500), are calibrated relative to 143\u2009GHz to better than 0 \u2026",

            "We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG) beyond the standard cosmological constant scenario. We start with cases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering Taylor expansions of the equation of state w(a), as well as principal component analysis and parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar field. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly improve present constraints and find that it has to be below ~2% (at 95% confidence) of the critical density, even when forced to play a role for z < 50 only. We then move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories, and coupled DE. In \u2026",

            "This paper presents the Planck 2015 likelihoods, statistical descriptions of the 2-point correlationfunctions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations that account for relevant uncertainties, both instrumental and astrophysical in nature. They are based on the same hybrid approach used for the previous release, i.e., a pixel-based likelihood at low multipoles (\u2113< 30) and a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of cross-power spectra at higher multipoles. The main improvements are the use of more and better processed data and of Planck polarization information, along with more detailed models of foregrounds and instrumental uncertainties. The increased redundancy brought by more than doubling the amount of data analysed enables further consistency checks and enhanced immunity to systematic effects. It also improves the constraining power of Planck, in \u2026",
