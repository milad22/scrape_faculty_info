            "This paper presents the results of a functional-integral approach to the dynamics of a two-state system coupled to a dissipative environment. It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the\" spin-boson\" problem;(2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem;(3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space \u2026",

This coupling, or friction, if strong enough, may substantially slow down motion along the reaction coordinate, and thus vitiate the assumption of electron transfer being nonadiabatic with respect to the nuclei. Here, a simple, fully quantum mechanical model for electron transfer using a one mode treatment which incorporates this coupling is studied. Path integral methods are used to study the dependence of the reaction rate on friction, and the limits of the moderate and the high friction are analyzed in detail. The first limit will prevail if the reaction coordinate is, e.g., an underdamped nuclear vibration, whereas the second limit will prevail if it corresponds to a slow or diffusive degree of freedom. In the high\u2010friction limit, the reaction rate is explicitly shown to vary between the nonadiabatic \u2026",

In some cases, the amplitudes from symmetry-related trajectories can interfere destructively, quenching the tunneling rate. This quenching need not be related to Kramers' degeneracy. This is shown by studying a problem (relevant to macroscopic quantum phenomena in ferromagnetic particles) with biaxial symmetry and an external field. The tunnel splitting is found to oscillate with the field, vanishing at certain values.

            "The effect of magnetoelastic dissipation upon the tunneling and coherence of the total magnetization in small (\u223c 100 A\u030a) single-domain ferromagnetic particles is investigated. Such tunneling would be an example of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon. It is shown that the dissipation has a super-Ohmic spectral density, J (\u03c9)\u223c \u03c9 3, and that the dissipation is weak for reasonable material parameters. Corrections to the rates, and the damping rate for coherent oscillations are obtained. A key feature is the inclusion of the elastic waves in the medium surrounding the particle.",
