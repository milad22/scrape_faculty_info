            "Networks of small, densely distributed wireless sensor nodes are being envisioned and developed for a variety of applications involving monitoring and the physical world in a tetherless fashion. Typically, each individual node can sense in multiple modalities but has limited communication and computation capabilities. Many challenges must be overcome before the concept of sensor networks In particular, there are two critical problems underlying successful operation of sensor networks: (1) efficient methods for exchanging information between the nodes and (2) collaborative signal processing (CSP) between the nodes to gather useful information about the physical world. This article describes the key ideas behind the CSP algorithms for distributed sensor networks being developed at the University of Wisconsin (UW). We also describe the basic ideas on how the CSP algorithms interface with the networking \u2026",

This method uses acoustic signal energy measurements taken at individual sensors of an ad hoc wireless sensor network to estimate the locations of multiple acoustic sources. Compared to the existing acoustic energy based source localization methods, this proposed ML method delivers more accurate results and offers the enhanced capability of multiple source localization. A multiresolution search algorithm and an expectation-maximization (EM) like iterative algorithm are proposed to expedite the computation of source locations. The Crame\/spl acute\/r-Rao Bound (CRB) of the ML source location estimate has been derived.

They use an ANN adaptive whitening filter to model the lower frequencies of the electrocardiogram (ECG) which are inherently nonlinear and nonstationary. The residual signal which contains mostly higher frequency QRS complex energy is then passed through a linear matched filter to detect the location of the QRS complex. The authors developed an algorithm to adaptively update the matched filter template from the detected QRS complex in the ECG signal itself so that the template can be customized to an individual subject. This ANN whitening filter is very effective at removing the time-varying, nonlinear noise characteristic of ECG signals. The detection rate for a very noisy patient record in the MIT\/BIH arrhythmia database is 99.5% with this approach, which compares favorably \u2026",

This method makes use of the characteristics that the acoustic energy decays inversely with respect to the square of distance from the source. By comparing energy readings measured at surrounding acoustic sensors, the source location during that time interval can be accurately estimated as the intersection of multiple hyperspheres. Theoretical bounds on the number of sensors required to yield unique solution are derived. Extensive simulations have been conducted to characterize the performance of this method under various parameter perturbations and noise conditions. Potential advantages of this approach include low intersensor communication requirement, robustness with respect to parameter perturbations and measurement noise, and low-complexity implementation.",

            "This research investigates the feasibility of using the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a new biometric for human identity verification. It is well known that the shapes of the ECG waveforms of different persons are different but it is unclear whether such differences can be used to identify different individuals. In this research, we demonstrated successfully that it is possible to identify a specific person from a group of candidates using a one-lead ECG. A one-lead ECG, unlike two-dimensional biometrics, such as the fingerprint, is a one-dimensional, low-frequency signal that can be recorded from electrodes on the hands. This research applied two techniques, template matching and a decision-based neural network (DBNN), to implement the identity verification. Using each of the two methods separately on a predetermined group of 20 subjects, the experimental results showed that the rate of correct identity verification was \u2026",
