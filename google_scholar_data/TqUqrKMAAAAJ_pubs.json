            "We show how a model of disordered Anderson lattices can account for many non-Fermi-liquid features observed in some Kondo alloys. Because of the exponential nature of the Kondo temperature scale T K, even moderate disorder leads to a rather broad distribution of Kondo temperatures, inducing strong effective disorder seen by the conduction electrons. Spins with very low T K's remain unquenched and dominate the low-temperature properties. This single underlying mechanism leads to logarithmic divergences in thermodynamic quantities and a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity.",

In this review, we present a broad overview of such disorder-driven non-Fermi liquid behaviour, and discuss various examples where the anomalies have been studied in detail.

            "Quantum phase transitions describe the violent rearrangement of electrons or atoms as they evolve from well defined excitations in one phase to a completely different set of excitations in another. The chapters in this book give insights into how a coherent metallic or superconducting state can be driven into an incoherent insulating state by increasing disorder, magnetic field, carrier concentration and inter-electron interactions. The problem necessarily involves many interacting particles and therein lies the challenge to develop a multi-faceted theory. Experiments probing microscopic structure, transport, charge and spin dynamics provide important clues. What sets this book apart is a strong dialog between experiment and theory that has the potential to solve some major issues in many-body physics. The ideas and methods developed here are bound to have repercussions in all spheres of physics.",

            "A model of spinless interacting electrons in the presence of disorder is examined using an extended dynamical mean-field formulation. When the interaction strength is large compared to the Fermi energy, a low temperature glassy phase is identified, which in our formulation corresponds to a replica symmetry breaking instability. The glassy phase is characterized by a pseudogap in the single-particle density of states, reminiscent of the Coulomb gap of Efros and Shklovskii. Because of ergodicity breaking, the \u201czero-field-cooled\u201d compressibility of this electron glass vanishes at T= 0, consistent with absence of screening. When the Fermi energy exceeds a critical value, the glassy phase is suppressed, and normal metallic behavior is recovered.",
