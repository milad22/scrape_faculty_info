            "Single microbial cells can show important local variations of elasticity due to the complex, anisotropic composition of their walls. An example of this is the yeast during cell division, where chitin is known to accumulate in the localized region of the cell wall involved in budding. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure quantitatively the local mechanical properties of hydrated yeast cells. Topographic images and spatially resolved force maps revealed significant lateral variations of elasticity across the cell surface, the bud scar region being significantly stiffer than the surrounding cell wall. To get quantitative information on sample elasticity, force curves were converted into force vs indentation curves. The curves were then fitted with the Hertz model, yielding Young's modulus values of 6.1 \u00b1 2.4 and 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 MPa for the bud scar and surrounding cell surface, respectively. These data lead us to conclude that \u2026",

            "The growth and division of Staphylococcus aureus was monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A good correlation of the structural events of division was found using the two microscopies, and AFM was able to provide new additional information. AFM was performed under water, ensuring that all structures were in the hydrated condition. Sequential images on the same structure revealed progressive changes to surfaces, suggesting the cells were growing while images were being taken. Using AFM small depressions were seen around the septal annulus at the onset of division that could be attributed to so-called murosomes (Giesbrecht et al., Arch. Microbiol. 141:315-324, 1985). The new cell wall formed from the cross wall (i.e., completed septum) after cell separation and possessed concentric surface rings and a central depression; these structures \u2026",

Here we present high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of type IV pili from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. An individual pilus ranges in length from 0.5 to 7 \u03bcm and has a diameter from 4 to 6 nm, although often, pili bundles in which the individual filaments differed in both length and diameter were seen. By attaching bacteria to AFM tips, it was possible to fasten the bacteria to mica surfaces by pili tethers. Force spectra of tethered pili gave rupture forces of 95 pN. The slopes of force curves close to the rupture force were nearly linear but showed little variation with pilus length. Furthermore, force curves could not be fitted with wormlike-chain polymer stretch models when using realistic persistence lengths for pili. The observation that the slopes near rupture did not depend on the pili length suggests that they do \u2026",

To this end, gold-coated substrates were first functionalized with Con A and thiol-terminated hexasaccharide molecules.

AFM images recorded in aqueous solution revealed that the hexasaccharide-terminated substrates interact specifically with the lectin.

            "Adhesive interactions between antigen\u2013antibody play a central role in immune system operation. The objective of this paper is to detect immune complexes without any label, by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We have proceeded by imaging antibody (anti-rabbit IgG) or anti-rabbit IgG moieties adsorbed onto mica surface, before and after incubation of two kinds of antigens: a specific (rabbit IgG) and a non-pecific one (sheep IgG). The analysis using the height histograms reveals many interesting features. We propose a general framework for interpreting height histogram measurements, which enable the discrimination between specific and non-specific complexes.",

            "Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, a bacterial pathogen of Atlantic salmon, has no visible pili, yet its genome contains genes for three type IV pilus systems. One system, Tap, is similar to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pil system, and a second, Flp, resembles the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Flp pilus, while the third has homology to the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin pilus of Vibrio cholerae. The latter system is likely nonfunctional since eight genes, including the gene encoding the main pilin subunit, are deleted compared with the orthologous V. cholerae locus. The first two systems were characterized to investigate their expression and role in pathogenesis. The pili of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida were imaged using atomic force microscopy and Tap- and Flp-overexpressing strains. The Tap pili appeared to be polar, while the Flp pili appeared to be peritrichous. Strains deficient in tap \u2026",
