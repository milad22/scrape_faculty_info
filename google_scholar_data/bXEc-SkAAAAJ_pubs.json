Polarized electrons were injected into an electron storage ring at a beam energy of 720 MeV. A Siberian snake was employed to preserve longitudinal polarization at the interaction point. Vector-polarized deuterium was produced by an atomic beam source and injected into an open-ended cylindrical cell, internal to the electron storage ring. The spin correlation parameter A ed V was measured for the reaction 2 H\u2192(e\u2192, e\u2032 n) p at a four-momentum transfer squared of 0.21 (GeV\/c) 2 from which a value for the charge form factor of the neutron was extracted.",

Scattered electrons and recoil deuterons were detected in coincidence with two large acceptance nonmagnetic detectors.

In the OLYMPUS measurement, 2.01 GeV electron and positron beams were directed through a hydrogen gas target internal to the DORIS storage ring at DESY. A toroidal magnetic spectrometer instrumented with drift chambers and time-of-flight scintillators detected elastically scattered leptons in coincidence with recoiling protons over a scattering angle range of\u2248 20 to 80. The relative luminosity between the two beam species was monitored using tracking telescopes of interleaved gas electron multiplier and multiwire proportional chamber detectors at 12, as well as symmetric M\u00f8ller or Bhabha calorimeters at 1.29. A total integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb\u2212 1 was collected. In the \u2026",
