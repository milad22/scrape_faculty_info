            "A programme is outlined for the assembly of a comprehensive dielectronic recombination database within the generalized collisional\u2013radiative (GCR) framework. It is valid for modelling ions of elements in dynamic finite-density plasmas such as occur in transient astrophysical plasmas such as solar flares and in the divertors and high transport regions of magnetic fusion devices. The resolution and precision of the data are tuned to spectral analysis and so are sufficient for prediction of the dielectronic recombination contributions to individual spectral line emissivities. The fundamental data are structured according to the format prescriptions of the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) and the production of relevant GCR derived data for application is described and implemented following ADAS. The requirements on the dielectronic recombination database are reviewed and the new data are placed in context \u2026",

            "Reliably interpreting spectra from electron\u2010ionized cosmic plasmas requires accurate ionization balance calculations for the plasma in question. However, much of the atomic data needed for these calculations have not been generated using modern theoretical methods and are often highly suspect. This translates directly into the reliability of the collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) calculations. We make use of state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art calculations of dielectronic recombination (DR) rate coefficients for the hydrogenic through Na\u2010like ions of all elements from He up to and including Zn. Where measurements exist, these published theoretical DR data agree with recent laboratory work to within typically 35% or better at the temperatures relevant for CIE. We also make use of state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art radiative recombination (RR) rate coefficient calculations for the bare through Na\u2010like ions of all elements from H through to Zn.
