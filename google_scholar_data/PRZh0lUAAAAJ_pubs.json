An experimental study of output power and wall-plug efficiency as functions of mirror losses was performed by varying the front facet coating reflectivity with a high-reflectivity-coated rear facet. The use of optimized reflectivity coatings on 7-mm-long chips resulted in continuous-wave output power of 2.9W at 293K for thermoelectrically cooled devices mounted on AlN submounts and average and continuous-wave output power in excess of 1W for uncooled devices emitting at 4.6\u03bcm.",
