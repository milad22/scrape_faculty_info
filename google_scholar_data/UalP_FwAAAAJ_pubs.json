            "Mice and cattle with genetic deficiencies in myostatin exhibit dramatic increases in skeletal muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin normally suppresses muscle growth. Whether this increased muscling results from prenatal or postnatal lack of myostatin activity is unknown. Here we show that myostatin circulates in the blood of adult mice in a latent form that can be activated by acid treatment. Systemic overexpression of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound muscle and fat loss analogous to that seen in human cachexia syndromes. These data indicate that myostatin acts systemically in adult animals and may be a useful pharmacologic target in clinical settings such as cachexia, where muscle growth is desired.",

Mineralization is characterized by apatite deposition on collagen fibrils and the presence of matrix vesicles, as has been described in calcified vascular lesions in vivo as well as in bone and teeth. In the present study, we used this model to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving vascular calcification. We found that BASMCs lost their lineage markers, SM22\u03b1 and smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, within 10 days of being placed under calcifying conditions. Conversely, the cells gained an osteogenic phenotype as indicated by an increase in expression and DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor, core binding factor \u03b11 (Cbfa1). Moreover, genes containing the Cbfa1 binding site, OSE2, including osteopontin, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase were elevated. The \u2026",

Recent evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species can act as signaling molecules by promoting the formation of disulfide bonds within or between select redox-sensitive proteins. However, few studies have attempted to examine global changes in disulfide bond formation following reactive oxygen species exposure. Here we isolate and identify disulfide-bonded proteins (DSBP) in a mammalian neuronal cell line (HT22) exposed to various oxidative insults by sequential nonreducing\/reducing two-dimensional SDS-PAGE combined with mass spectrometry. By using this strategy, several known cytosolic DSBP, such as peroxiredoxins, thioredoxin reductase, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, and ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase, were \u2026",

A comparative display of the expression patterns indicated that enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways are present in all tissues, whereas metabolic specialization is reflected in the occurrence of a tissue-specific enzyme complement. For example, tissue-specific and subcellular compartment-specific isoforms of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase were detected, thus providing proteomic confirmation of the presence of distinct regulatory mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and breakdown of separate starch pools in \u2026",

We conclude that proteome analysis is an essential tool in the understanding of regulated biological systems. Current technology, while still mostly limited to the more abundant proteins, enables the use of proteome analysis both to establish databases of proteins present, and to perform biological assays involving measurement of multiple variables.

            "In this review we examine the current state of analytical methods in proteomics. The conventional methodology using two-dimensional electrophoresis gels and mass spectrometry is discussed, with particular reference to the advantages and shortcomings thereof. Two recently published methods which offer an alternative approach are presented and discussed, with emphasis on how they can provide information not available via twodimensional gel electrophoresis. These two methods are the isotope-coded affinity tags approach of Gygi et al. and the two-dimensional liquid chromatography\u0105tandem mass spectrometry approach as presented by Link et al. We conclude that both of these new techniques represent significant advances in analytical methodology for proteome analysis. Furthermore, we believe that in the future biological research will continue to be enhanced by the continuation of such developments \u2026",

            "Diatoms are unicellular eucaryotic algae with cell walls containing silica, intricately and ornately structured on the nanometer scale. Overall silica structure is formed by expansion and molding of the membrane-bound silica deposition vesicle. Although molecular details of silica polymerization are being clarified, we have limited insight into molecular components of the silica deposition vesicle, particularly of membrane-associated proteins that may be involved in structure formation. To identify such proteins, we refined existing procedures to isolate an enriched cell wall fraction from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, the first diatom with a sequenced genome. We applied tandem mass spectrometric analysis to this fraction, identifying 31 proteins for further evaluation. mRNA levels for genes encoding these proteins were monitored during synchronized progression through the cell cycle and compared with two \u2026",
