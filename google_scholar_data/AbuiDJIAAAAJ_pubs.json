We focus on plasmas in which \u03b2 lesssim 1, where \u03b2 is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure. As in previous studies, we find that when the turbulence amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, an ion's orbit becomes chaotic. The ion then interacts stochastically with the time-varying electrostatic potential, and the ion's energy undergoes a random walk. Using phenomenological arguments, we derive an analytic expression for the rates at which different ion species are heated, which we test by simulating test particles interacting with a spectrum of randomly phased AWs and KAWs. We find that the stochastic heating rate depends sensitively on the \u2026",

The counterflowing plumes sweep up and compress the background plasma and the magnetic field into a pair of magnetized ribbons, which collide, stagnate, and reconnect at the midplane, allowing the first detailed observations of a stretched current sheet in laser-driven reconnection experiments.

New results, obtained by asymptotic analyses and high-resolution numerical simulations [using Adaptive Mesh Refinement] of the Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) or two-fluid equations, are presented. Within the framework of Hall MHD, a two-dimensional collisionless reconnection model is considered in which electron inertia provides the mechanism for breaking field lines, and the electron pressure gradient plays a crucial role in controlling magnetic island dynamics. Current singularities tend to form in finite time and drive fast and impulsive reconnection.

A comprehensive albeit qualitative explanation for both the transport channels is provided in the framework of the theory of ion temperature gradient and trapped electron mode microinstabilities. The different transport behaviors are related to the dominant instability at play and to the collisionality regime. In particular, central electron heating induces a flattening of the density profile when the dominant instability is a trapped electron mode, and density peaking is observed to increase with decreasing collisionality.",
