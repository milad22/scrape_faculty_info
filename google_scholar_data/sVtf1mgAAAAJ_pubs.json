            "Major advances in our understanding of the universe have historically arisen from dramatic improvements in our ability to \u201csee.\u201d We have developed progressively larger telescopes over the past century, allowing us to peer further into space, and further back in time. With the development of advanced instrumentation\u2014imagers, spectrographs, and polarimeters\u2014we have been able to parse radiation detected from distant sources over the full electromagnetic spectrum in increasingly subtle ways. These data have provided the detailed information needed to construct physical models of planets, stars, galaxies, quasars, and larger structures and to probe the new physics of dark matter and dark energy.Until recently, most astronomical investigations have focused on small samples of cosmic sources or individual objects. This is because our largest telescope facilities typically had rather small fields of view, and those \u2026",
