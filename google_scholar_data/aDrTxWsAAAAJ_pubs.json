            "We use ultrahigh resolution, tunable, vacuum ultraviolet laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the electronic properties of WTe 2, a material that was predicted to be a type-II Weyl semimetal. The Weyl fermion states in WTe 2 were proposed to emerge at the crossing points of electron and hole pockets, and Fermi arcs connecting electron and hole pockets would be visible in the spectral function on (001) surface. Here we report the observation of such Fermi arcs in WTe 2 confirming the theoretical predictions. This provides strong evidence for type-II Weyl semimetallic states in WTe 2. We also find that trivial and topological domains coexist on the same surface of the sample due to the presence of inhomogeneous strain detected by scanning electron microscopy data. This is in agreement with the theoretical prediction that strain can drive this system from topological Weyl to trivial \u2026",

            "We use ultrahigh resolution, tunable, vacuum ultraviolet laser-based, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), temperature-and field-dependent resistivity, and thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements to study the electronic properties of WTe 2, a compound that manifests exceptionally large, temperature-dependent magnetoresistance. The Fermi surface consists of two pairs of electron and two pairs of hole pockets along the X\u2212 \u0393\u2212 X direction. Using detailed ARPES temperature scans, we find a rare example of a temperature-induced Lifshitz transition at T\u2243 160 K, associated with the complete disappearance of the hole pockets. Our electronic structure calculations show a clear and substantial shift of the chemical potential \u03bc (T) due to the semimetal nature of this material driven by modest changes in temperature. This change of Fermi surface topology is also corroborated by the temperature \u2026",

            "Single-crystalline, single-phase CaKFe 4 As 4 has been grown out of a high-temperature, quaternary melt. Temperature-dependent measurements of x-ray diffraction, anisotropic electrical resistivity, elastoresistivity, thermoelectric power, Hall effect, magnetization, and specific heat, combined with field-dependent measurements of electrical resistivity and field and pressure-dependent measurements of magnetization indicate that CaKFe 4 As 4 is an ordered, stoichiometric, Fe-based superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature, T c= 35.0\u00b10.2 K. Other than superconductivity, there is no indication of any other phase transition for 1.8 K\u2264 T\u2264 300 K. All of these thermodynamic and transport data reveal striking similarities to those found for optimally or slightly overdoped (Ba 1\u2212 x K x) Fe 2 As 2, suggesting that stoichiometric CaKFe 4 As 4 is intrinsically close to what is referred to as \u201coptimal-doped\u201d on a \u2026",
