            "RECENT reports 1\u20133 of superconductivity in alkali-metal-doped compounds of the icosahedral C 60 (buckminsterfullerene) molecule have attracted great experimental and theoretical interest. Superconductivity was originally discovered in samples prepared from gas\u2013solid reactions 1, which made it impossible to determine the composition or structure of the superconducting phase. Holczer et al. 4 demonstrated that potassium-doped C 60 has only a single stable superconducting phase, K 3 C 60, with a transition temperature of 19.3 K. Improvements have since resulted in the preparation of 100% bulk superconductors 3. Because of the absence of impurity phases, we have been able to perform accurate Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction data from the superconducting phase. Here we report our results for the crystal structure of K 3 C 60, determining that this superconducting compound has a face-centred cubic \u2026",

The effects of mixing and heat treatment of K C samples prepared over a wide range of initial compositions on the superconducting transition was determined from shielding diamagnetism measurements. A single superconducting phase (T = 19.3 K) occurs for which the composition is KC. The shielding reaches a maximum of greater than 40 percent of the perfect diamagnetism, a high value for a powder sample, in samples prepared from 3:1 mixtures. A RbC sample prepared and analyzed in an analogous way exhibited evidence for superconductivity with T = 30 K and a diamagnetic shielding of 7 percent could be obtained.",

The fact that the C 60 molecule participates in these two disparate effects is in itself striking; furthermore, the C 60-based material has the highestT c of any molecular organic ferromagnet 6. An understanding of the physical origin of this ferromagnetism is sure to require a knowledge of the crystal structure. Here we report on an X-ray diffraction study of the ferromagnet TDAE\u2013C 60, where TDAE is tetrakis (dimethylamino) ethylene, C 2 N 4 (CH 3) 8. We find that the composition is stoichiometric with 1: 1 ratio of TDAE to C 60. The structure has a c-centred monoclinic unit cell suggestive of an anisotropic, low-dimensional band structure.

Here we report muon-spin-relaxation measurements of the magnetic-field penetration depth \u03bb in K 3 C 60. The temperature dependence of \u03bb and of the muon spin relaxation rate indicate that the superconducting energy gap is isotropic, without nodes or zero points. The low-temperature penetration depth \u03bb (T\u21d2 0) is about 4,800 \u00c5, which implies a ratio of superconducting carrier density to effective mass to be n 2\/(m*\/m e)= 1.2 x 10 20 cm-3 if one assumes the'clean limit' \u2026",

            "The superconducting compound K3C60 (with transition temperature Tc = 19.3 kelvin at ambient pressure), formed as a single phase by reaction of alkali vapor with solids of the icosahedral C60 molecule (buckminsterfullerene), shows a very large decrease of Tc with increasing pressure. Susceptibility measurements on sintered pellets showing bulk superconductivity are reported up to 21 kilobars of pressure, where Tc is already less than 8 kelvin. The results are consistent with a piling up of the density of states at the Fermi level.",

The results are comprehensively explained in terms of highly-one-dimensional diffusive spins which can be trapped in the presence of impurities, or defects, in particular those connected to oxygen contamination. The average number of diffusive spins, as given by the diffusive-spin population at thermal equilibrium, is a function of temperature through two parameters: the trap-site concentration and the trapping energy. Trap-site concentrations of 5% and 25% have been obtained for samples sealed under vacuum and air-contaminated samples, respectively. The trapping energy is found to be distributed, from chain to chain, from a maximum value E 0\u2243 0.06 eV, which likely corresponds to the chain nearest to \u2026",
