            "CARBON nanotubes are predicted to have interesting mechanical properties\u2014in particular, high stiffness and axial strength\u2014as a result of their seamless cylindrical graphitic structure 1\u20135. Their mechanical properties have so far eluded direct measurement, however, because of the very small dimensions of nanotubes. Here we estimate the Young's modulus of isolated nanotubes by measuring, in the transmission electron microscope, the amplitude of their intrinsic thermal vibrations. We find that carbon nanotubes have exceptionally high Young's moduli, in the terapascal (TPa) range. Their high stiffness, coupled with their low density, implies that nanotubes might be useful as nanoscale fibres in strong, lightweight composite materials.",

A near extreme example of stacking disorder is provided by zeolite beta, a large pore, high-silica zeolite that was first reported in 1967. We describe here the determination of the framework structure of zeolite beta, using primarily high-resolution electron microscopy, electron diffraction, computer-assisted modelling and powder X-ray diffraction. Zeolite beta can be regarded as a highly intergrown hybrid of two distinct, but closely related structures that both have fully three-dimensional pore systems with 12-rings as the minimum constricting apertures. One end member, polymorph A, forms an enantiomorphic pair, space group symmetries P4122 and P4322, with a = 1.25 nm, c = 2.66 nm.

The problem of nucleation has been complicated by the great variety of structures observed in any one sample. Here we report an unusual carbon sample generated by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, consisting entirely of graphitic microstructures with total disclinations that are multiples of+ 60. The disclination of each structure corresponds to the presence of a given number of pentagons in the seed from which it grew: disks (no pentagons), five types of cones (one to five pentagons), of which only one was known previously 18, and open tubes (six \u2026",

Recursion gives a set of simple relations between average interference terms from a statistical crystal, which can be solved as a set of simultaneous equations. The diffracted intensity for a polycrystalline sample is given by the incoherent sum of scattered intensities over an ensemble of crystallites. The relations between this and previous approaches, namely the Hendricks-Teller matrix formulation, the difference equation method, the summed series formula of Cowley, and Michalski\u2019s recurrence relations between average phase factors, are discussed.

            "In this paper, it is pointed out that the light transmission anomalies observed for thin-film metallic gratings can be explained entirely in terms of dynamical diffraction theory. Surface plasmons are an intrinsic component of the diffracted wave field and, as such, play no independent causal role in the anomalies, as has been implied by others. The dynamical scattering matrix for the Bloch-wave modes of the diffracted photon wave field (E, H) is derived for a three-dimensionally periodic medium with arbitrary dielectric constant. A new theoretical treatment and numerical results are presented for a one-dimensional array of slits. In model metallic slit arrays, with negative dielectric constant, 100% and 0% transmission is possible at different wavelengths in the zero-order beam. In slit arrays, both propagating and evanescent modes (traditional surface plasmons) are strongly excited at both the peak and the minimum \u2026",

Using the present synthetic techniques, samples typically contain 30% or more amorphous carbon and catalytic metal particle impurities. An extremely simple and efficient method of purification, involving boiling the nanotubes in concentrated nitric acid, is reported. It is demonstrated that this method removes most of the impurities and, unlike some other methods, is not sensitive to the quality of the starting material.",

A general method of overcoming this is proposed in which the surface is preoxidized, producing various groups on the surface. These surface groups then act as nucleation points. For example, in the electroless plating reaction the surface of the nanotubes becomes decorated with silver particles (see figure).        ",
