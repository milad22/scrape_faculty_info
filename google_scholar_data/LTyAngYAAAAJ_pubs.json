            "The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7\u03c3 confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.",

The COHERENT collaboration reported the first detection of CEvNS [Akimov: 2017ade] using a CsI [Na] detector. At present the collaboration is deploying four detector technologies: a CsI [Na] scintillating crystal, p-type point-contact germanium detectors, single-phase liquid argon, and NaI [Tl] crystals. All detectors are located in the neutron-quiet basement of the SNS target building at distances 20-30 m from the SNS neutrino source. The simultaneous measurement in all four COHERENT detector subsystems will test the  dependence of the cross section and search for new physics. In addition, COHERENT is measuring neutrino-induced neutrons from charged-and neutral-current neutrino interactions on nuclei in shielding materials, which represent a non-negligible background for CEvNS as well as being of intrinsic interest. The Collaboration is planning as well to look for charged-current interactions of relevance to supernova and weak-interaction physics.

In spite of its large cross section, the CEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting nuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The measurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of ultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive particle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted in the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It is relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables validation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In the long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear structure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased approach: a 14-kg CsI [Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact germanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection chamber. Following an extensive background measurement campaign, a location in the SNS basement has proven to be neutron-quiet and suitable for deployment of the COHERENT detector suite. The simultaneous deployment of the three COHERENT detector subsystems will test the  dependence of the cross section and ensure an unambiguous discovery of CEvNS. This document describes \u2026",

The cross sections were measured at 34 different \u03b3-ray energies with an enriched 48 Ca target. Neutron emission is the dominant decay mechanism in the measured energy range that spans from the threshold, across the previously identified M 1 strength, and up the low-energy edge of the E 1 giant dipole resonance. This paper found B (M 1)= 6.8\u00b10.5 \u03bc N 2 for the 10.23-MeV resonance, a value greater than previously measured. Structures in the cross section have been observed whose magnitudes are in agreement with existing data and that are commensurate \u2026",
