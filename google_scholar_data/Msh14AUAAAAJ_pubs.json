            "Much excitement has been generated by the success of stochastic local search procedures at finding solutions to large, very hard satisfiability problems. Many of the problems on which these procedures have been effective are non-Boolean in that they are most naturally formulated in terms of variables with domain sizes greater than two. Approaches to solving non-Boolean satisfiability problems fall into two categories. In the direct approach, the problem is tackled by an algorithm for non-Boolean problems. In the transformation approach, the non-Boolean problem is reformulated as an equivalent Boolean problem and then a Boolean solver is used.This paper compares four methods for solving non-Boolean problems: one direct and three transformational. The comparison first examines the search spaces confronted by the four methods, and then tests their ability to solve random formulas, the round \u2026",

It has been shown that a solver based on an encoding of QCSP into QBF can outperform the existing direct QCSP approaches by several orders of magnitude. In this paper we introduce an efficient QCSP solver. We show how knowledge learned from the successful encoding of QCSP into QBF can be utilized to enhance the existing QCSP techniques and speed up search by orders of magnitude. We also show how the performance of the solver can be further enhanced by incorporating advanced lookback techniques such as CBJ and solution-directed pruning. Experiments demonstrate that our solver is several orders of magnitude faster than existing direct approaches to QCSP solving, and significantly outperforms approaches based on encoding QCSPs as QBFs.",

Interest in this topic is increasing following recent advances in Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBFs), the analogous generalisation of satisfiability (SAT). We show that we can encode QC-SPs as QBFs. We introduce a simple generalisation of the direct encoding of CSPs into SAT. We then introduce some adaptations of this encoding to make it effective in a QBF solver. We solve some QCSP test instances orders of magnitude faster than using a specialised QCSP solver, taking advantage of the more advanced state of the art in QBF solving. Our conclusions are twofold. First, there is considerably more subtlety required in encodings in QBF than in SAT. Second, in an area such as QCSP where algorithmic techniques are not yet highly developed, encodings into a better understood problem can give access to extremely advanced search methods with very little implementation effort.",
