            "Normal tissue cells are generally not viable when suspended in a fluid and are therefore said to be anchorage dependent. Such cells must adhere to a solid, but a solid can be as rigid as glass or softer than a baby9s skin. The behavior of some cells on soft materials is characteristic of important phenotypes; for example, cell growth on soft agar gels is used to identify cancer cells. However, an understanding of how tissue cells\u2014including fibroblasts, myocytes, neurons, and other cell types\u2014sense matrix stiffness is just emerging with quantitative studies of cells adhering to gels (or to other cells) with which elasticity can be tuned to approximate that of tissues. Key roles in molecular pathways are played by adhesion complexes and the actinmyosin cytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures. The feedback of local matrix stiffness on cell state likely has important implications for \u2026",

When grown in sparse culture with no cell\u2010cell contacts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells show an abrupt change in spread area that occurs at a stiffness range around 3,000 Pa. No actin stress fibers are seen in fibroblasts on soft surfaces, and the appearance of stress fibers is abrupt and complete at a stiffness range coincident with that at which they spread. Upregulation of \u03b15 integrin also occurs in the same stiffness range, but exogenous expression of \u03b15 integrin is not sufficient to cause cell spreading on soft surfaces.

Rev. 78: 763\u2013781, 1998. \u2014 The three-dimensional intracellular network formed by the filamentous polymers comprising the cytoskeletal affects the way cells sense their extracellular environment and respond to stimuli. Because the cytoskeleton is viscoelastic, it provides a continuous mechanical coupling throughout the cell that changes as the cytoskeleton remodels. Such mechanical effects, based on network formation, can influence ion channel activity at the plasma membrane of cells and may conduct mechanical stresses from the cell membrane to internal organelles. As a result, both rapid responses such as changes in intracellular Ca2+ and slower responses such as gene transcription or the onset of apoptosis can be elicited or modulated by mechanical perturbations.

            "Cells respond to diverse external stimuli by polymerizing cytoplasmic actin, and recent evidence indicates that GTPases can specify where this polymerization takes place. Actin assembly in stimulated blood platelets occurs where sequestered monomers add onto the fast-growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments (F-actin), which are capped in the resting cells. We report that D3 and D4 polyphosphoinositides, PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3, uncap F-actin in resting permeabilized platelets. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), GTP, and GTP\u03b3S, but not GDP\u03b2S, also uncap F-actin in permeabilized platelets. GDP\u03b2S inhibits TRAP-induced F-actin uncapping, and PI(4,5)P2 overcomes this inhibition. Constitutively active mutant Rac, but not Rho, activates uncapping of F-actin. PI(4,5)P2-binding peptides derived from gelsolin inhibit F-actin uncapping by TRAP, Rac, and GTP\u03b3S. TRAP and Rac \u2026",

            "The mechanical properties of substrates underlying cells can have profound effects on cell structure and function. To examine the effect of substrate deformability on neuronal cell growth, protein-laminated polyacrylamide gels were prepared with differing amounts of bisacrylamide to generate substrates of varying deformability with elastic moduli ranging from 500 to 5500 dyne\/cm 2. Mouse spinal cord primary neuronal cells were plated on the gels and allowed to grow and extend neurites for several weeks in culture. While neurons grew well on the gels, glia, which are normally co-cultured with the neurons, did not survive on these deformable substrates even though the chemical environment was permissive for their growth. Substrate flexibility also had a significant effect on neurite branching. Neurons grown on softer substrates formed more than three times as many branches as those grown on stiffer gels.
