            "The Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) Reconnection Challenge project is presented and the important results, which are presented in a series of companion papers, are summarized. Magnetic reconnection is studied in a simple Harris sheet configuration with a specified set of initial conditions, including a finite amplitude, magnetic island perturbation to trigger the dynamics. The evolution of the system is explored with a broad variety of codes, ranging from fully electromagnetic particle in cell (PIC) codes to conventional resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) codes, and the results are compared. The goal is to identify the essential physics which is required to model collisionless magnetic reconnection. All models that include the Hall effect in the generalized Ohm's law produce essentially indistinguishable rates of reconnection, corresponding to nearly Alfv\u00e9nic inflow velocities. Thus the rate of reconnection \u2026",

In the Earth's magnetosphere, electron energies reach hundreds of thousands of electron volts (refs 1\u20133), whereas the typical electron energies associated with large-scale reconnection-driven flows are just a few electron volts. Recent observations further suggest that these energetic particles are produced in the region where the magnetic field reconnects 4. In solar flares, upwards of 50 per cent of the energy released can appear as energetic electrons 5, 6. Here we show that electrons gain kinetic energy by reflecting from the ends of the contracting \u2018magnetic islands\u2019 that form as reconnection proceeds.

In addition, the reconnection rate is independent of the mechanism which breaks the frozen\u2010in flux condition, whether it is electron inertia or grid scale diffusion. The insensitivity to the mechanism which breaks the frozen\u2010in condition is a consequence of whistler waves, which control the plasma dynamics at the small scales where the ions become unmagnetized.

Scaling laws for the reconnection rate, outflow speed, the density of the outflow, and the structure of the dissipation region are derived from first principles. These results are independent of the dissipation mechanism. It is shown that a generic feature of asymmetric reconnection is that the X-line and stagnation point are not colocated, leading to a bulk flow of plasma across the X-line. The scaling laws are verified using two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamics numerical simulations for the special case of asymmetric magnetic fields with symmetric density.

            "Hybrid simulations with electron inertia, along with analytic scaling arguments, are presented which demonstrate that magnetic reconnection remains Alfv\u00e9nic in a collisionless system even as the macroscopic scale length of the system becomes very large. This fast reconnection is facilitated by the whistler physics present near the x\u2010line. The reconnection rate is found to be a universal constant corresponding to an inflow velocity towards the x\u2010line of around 0.1 cA.",

            "Particle-in-cell simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are presented that demonstrate that reconnection remains fast in very large systems. The electron dissipation region develops a distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. Consistent with fast reconnection, the length of the electron current layer stabilizes and decreases with decreasing electron mass, approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. Surprisingly, the electrons form a super-Alfv\u00e9nic outflow jet that remains decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from the x line.",
