            "The most important factor, which indicates the improvement of properties in rubber by nanoclay, is the distribution in the rubber matrix. The simple mixing of rubber and nanoclay will not exfoliate the filler in the rubbery matrix. Hence, some sort of compatibilizer like epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) can be utilized safely in exfoliating the nanoclay in the matrix polymer. Epoxidized natural rubber and organically modified nanoclay composites (EC) were prepared by solution mixing. The nanoclay employed in this study was Cloisite 20A. The obtained nanocomposites were incorporated in nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) with sulphur as a curing agent. The morphological study showed the intercalation of nanoclay in ENR and further incorporation of EC in NBR matrix leads to exfoliation of nanoclay. Curing study demonstrated faster scorch time, cure time and increase in maximum torque for the EC incorporated NBR \u2026",

The effect of filler on morphological and wear characteristics was studied. ISAF (Intermediate Super Abrasion Furnace) type of carbon black have showed a significant effect on optimum cure time, cure rate index and mechanical properties by reacting at the interface between HSR and NR matrix. All the samples show only one melting peak on the DSC curve; this is attributed to the same backbone structure of the matrix and the carbon black reinforcement. The samples containing 30 wt.% of HSR with ISAF type of carbon black has shown maximum heat buildup, lower swelling and lower compression set value. Blends containing ISAF type of carbon black with 30 wt.% of HSR showed high abrasion resistant properties against Du-Pont abrader, DIN \u2026",

            "Wood-plastic composite (WPC) is a non-recyclable composite material lumber or timber made of recycled plastic and wood wastes which has become one of the most dynamic sectors of the plastics industry in this decade. It is used in numerous applications, such as, outdoor deck floors, railings, fences, landscaping timbers, park benches, window and door frames. This book starts with a brief glimpse at the basic structures and properties of WPCs. Aspects such as surface treatment, machinery used and testing types of WPCs are also covered. The following chapters of the book give a view of foam technology, flame retardant properties and colour retardant properties of WPCs. The way morphology affects or controls the physical and mechanical behaviours of the finished materials is discussed. Finally, the authors give an overview of the applications of wood-plastic composites in daily life. The book may serve as a source book for scientists wishing to work in this field.",

Molding conditions and waste ground rubber tire (WGRT) powder have been found to have profound effects on the cell structures and mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP) and waste ground rubber tire powder composite samples. The result shows that microcellular PP\/WGRT blend samples exhibit smaller cell size and higher cell density compare with polypropylene resin.
