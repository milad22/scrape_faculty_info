            "We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and \u2026",

The \u201cAriadne's clew\u201d we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate \u201canomalous\u201d (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.",

This provides a mean-field picture of strongly corrrelated systems, which becomes exact as d\u2192\u221e. We point out a special integrable case of the mean-field equations, and study the general case using a perturbative renormalization group around the atomic limit. Three distinct Fermi-liquid regimes arise, corresponding to the Kondo, mixed-valence, and empty-orbitals regimes of the single-impurity problem. The Kondo resonance and the satellite peaks of the single-impurity model correspond to the quasiparticle and Hubbard-bands features of the Hubbard model, respectively.",
