Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to a bronchial provocation test (BPT) with histamine was measured at baseline. AHR to BPT with mannitol,  spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), and, in 31 subjects, sputum inflammatory cells were measured at baseline and at monthly  intervals. Thirty-nine subjects suffered an asthma exacerbation.  Seven subjects were successfully weaned off ICS. Using a Kaplan\u2013 Meier survival analysis, the significant predictors of a failure of ICS  reduction were being hyperresponsive to both histamine and mannitol at baseline (p  =  0.039), and being hyperresponsive to mannitol during the dose-reduction phase of the study (p  =  0.02).

            "This review focuses on bottom-up processes such as precipitation (or crystallisation) and single droplet evaporation to produce nanoparticles containing largely pure therapeutics for pharmaceutical applications. Suitable precipitation techniques involve the use of high-gravity, confined impinging liquid jet mixing, multi-inlet vortex mixing, supercritical fluids, and ultrasonic waves. Droplet evaporation methods are spray-based, including nanospray drying, aerosol flow reactor method, spraying of low-boiling point solvent under ambient conditions and electrospraying of low-electrical conducting solutions. A key to the success of yielding stable nanoparticles in these various techniques is to control the particle growth kinetics through evaporation rate of the droplets or mixing rate during precipitation.",

The powders were dispersed using the Rotahaler\u00ae and the Dinkihaler\u00ae coupled to a four-stage liquid impinger operating at 30 to 120 L\/min.

            "To date, various nanodrug systems have been developed for different routes of administration, which include dendrimers, nanocrystals, emulsions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Nanodrug systems have been employed to improve the efficacy, safety, physicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic profile of pharmaceutical substances. In particular, functionalized nanodrug systems can offer enhanced bioavailability of orally taken drugs, prolonged half-life of injected drugs (by reducing immunogenicity), and targeted delivery to specific tissues. Thus, nanodrug systems might lower the frequency of administration while providing maximized pharmacological effects and minimized systemic side effects, possibly leading to better therapeutic compliance and clinical outcomes. In spite of these attractive pharmacokinetic advantages, recent attention has \u2026",

They have recently been explored in pressurized metered dose inhaler, nebulizer, and dry powder inhaler applications, mostly in polymeric forms. This article presents a review of processes that have been used to generate pure (non polymeric) drug nanoparticles, methods for characterizing the particles\/formulations, their in-vitro and in-vivo performances, and the fate of inhaled nanoparticles.",
