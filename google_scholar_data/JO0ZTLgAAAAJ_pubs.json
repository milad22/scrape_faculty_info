            "We present the final report from a series of precision measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a \u03bc=(g\u2212 2)\/2. The details of the experimental method, apparatus, data taking, and analysis are summarized. Data obtained at Brookhaven National Laboratory, using nearly equal samples of positive and negative muons, were used to deduce a \u03bc (Expt)= 11659208.0 (5.4)(3.3)\u00d7 10\u2212 10, where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given, respectively. The combined uncertainty of 0.54 ppm represents a 14-fold improvement compared to previous measurements at CERN. The standard model value for a \u03bc includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes. While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest theoretical uncertainty,\u2248 0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic vacuum polarization.

            "The muon anomalous magnetic moment has been measured in a new experiment at Brookhaven. Polarized muons were stored in a superferric ring, and the angular frequency difference, \u03c9 a, between the spin precession and orbital frequencies was determined by measuring the time distribution of high-energy decay positrons. The ratio R of \u03c9 a to the Larmor precession frequency of free protons, \u03c9 p, in the storage-ring magnetic field was measured. We find R= 3.707 220 (48)\u00d7 10\u2212 3. With \u03bc \u03bc\/\u03bc p= 3.183 345 47 (47) this gives a \u03bc+= 1 165 925 (15)\u00d7 10\u2212 9 (\u00b113 ppm), in good agreement with the previous CERN measurements for \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 and of approximately the same precision.",

Two different stopping target configurations were employed in independent data-taking periods. The combined results give \u03c4 \u03bc+(MuLan)= 2 196 980.3 (2.2) ps, more than 15 times as precise as any previous experiment.
