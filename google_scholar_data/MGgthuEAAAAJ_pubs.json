            "Extensively revised, the fourth edition of this highly successful book takes into account the many newly determined protein structures that provide molecular insight into chemiosmotic energy transduction, as well as reviewing the explosive advances in'mitochondrial physiology'-the role of the mitochondria in the life and death of the cell. Covering mitochondria, bacteria and chloroplasts, the fourth edition of Bioenergetics provides a clear and comprehensive account of the chemiosmotic theory and its many applications. The figures have been carefully designed to be memorable and to convey the key functional and mechanistic information. Written for students and researchers alike, Bioenergetics is the most well-known, current and respected text on chemiosmotic theory and membrane bioenergetics available. BMA Medical Book Awards 2014-Highly Commended, Basic and Clinical Sciences, 2014, British Medical Association Chapters are now divided between three interlocking sections: basic principles, structures and mechanisms, and mitochondrial physiology. Covers new advances in the structure and mechanism of key bioenergetic proteins, including complex I of the respiratory chain and transport proteins. Details cellular bioenergetics, mitochondrial cell biology and signal transduction, and the roles of mitochondria in physiology, disease and aging. Offers readers clear, visual representation of structural concepts through full colour figures throughout the book.",

            "Assessing mitochondrial dysfunction requires definition of the dysfunction to be investigated. Usually, it is the ability of the mitochondria to make ATP appropriately in response to energy demands. Where other functions are of interest, tailored solutions are required. Dysfunction can be assessed in isolated mitochondria, in cells or in vivo, with different balances between precise experimental control and physiological relevance. There are many methods to measure mitochondrial function and dysfunction in these systems. Generally, measurements of fluxes give more information about the ability to make ATP than do measurements of intermediates and potentials. For isolated mitochondria, the best assay is mitochondrial respiratory control: the increase in respiration rate in response to ADP. For intact cells, the best assay is the equivalent measurement of cell respiratory control, which reports the rate of ATP \u2026",

At that time, however, it was not possible to generalize about the contribution of brown fat to nonshivering thermogenesis, because this tissue was apparently of minor importance in the thermoregulation of most adult experimental animals (103-105129). Additionally no explanation could be given at the molecular level for the unique thermogenic capacity of the tissue. This review attempts to cover the developments in understanding of the scope and mechanism of brown fat thermogenesis after this fruitful period.The recent upsurge in interest in brown adipose tissue has been precipitated by three main findings.

Here we review the functional bioenergetics of isolated mitochondria, with emphasis on the chemiosmotic proton circuit and the application (and occasional misapplication) of these principles to intact neurons.

Glutamate can be released from cells by two mechanisms: either by Ca2+-dependent vesicular release or, in pathological conditions, by reversal of the plasma membrane uptake carrier. The contrasting pharmacology and ionic, dependence of the glutamate uptake carriers in the vesicle membrane and in the plasma membrane explain how glutamate (but probably not aspartate) can function as a neurotransmitter, and why the extracellular glutamate concentration rises to neurotoxic levels in brain anoxia.",

            "  1 A technique is described, based on the distribution of rubidium, acetate and methylammonium ions, for the simultaneous estimation of membrane potential and pH gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The technique requires less than 0.5 mg mitochondrial protein and is independent of many factors which interfere with electrode determinations of protonmotive force (\u0394p).  2 With a limiting matrix volume of 0.4 \u03bcl\/mg mitochondrial protein, the indicated value of \u0394p for rat liver mitochondria is 228 mV in state 4, 170 mV in state 3, and \u20130.6 mV in the presence of rotenone and uncoupler. The relative contributions of the pH gradient and membrane potential are dependent on the availability of electrophoretically and electroneutrally translocatable species in the incubation medium.  3 In a sucrose\u2010based medium containing 0.5 mM KCl, rotenone and uncoupler, the technique indicated a membrane \u2026",

The central mitochondrial bioenergetic parameter is the protonmotive force, \u0394p. Much research has focused on the monitoring of the major component of \u0394p, the mitochondrial membrane potential \u0394\u03c8m, in intact neurones exposed to excitotoxic stimuli, in the hope of establishing the causal relationships between cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Glutamate\u2010evoked Ca2+ deregulation is exacerbated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor rotenone. Cells maintained by glycolytic ATP, i.e., in the presence of the mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, remain viable for several hours but are still susceptible to glutamate; thus, disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is not a necessary step in glutamate excitotoxicity.
