I determine when it is permissible to integrate out the fermions and analyze the critical phenomena via an effective bosonic theory in which only fluctuations of the ordering field are explicitly retained. By solving appropriate scaling equations I obtain the different regimes of behavior of the correlation length and free energy in the disordered phase of the effective bosonic theory. The results in many cases differ from those of Hertz, but make contact with more recent work on the dilute Bose gas. I briefly discuss the relevance of the results to heavy-fermion materials.",

            "The concept of quantum criticality is proving to be central to attempts to understand the physics of strongly correlated electrons. Here, we argue that observations on the itinerant metamagnet Sr3Ru2O7 represent good evidence for a new class of quantum critical point, arising when the critical end point terminating a line of first-order transitions is depressed toward zero temperature. This is of interest both in its own right and because of the convenience of having a quantum critical point for which the tuning parameter is the magnetic field. The relationship between the resultant critical fluctuations and novel behavior very near the critical field is discussed.",

A fundamental issue has been atomic reconstruction: how the surface lattice symmetry differs from the bulk.\u2018Correlated-electron compounds\u2019 are materials in which strong electron\u2013electron and electron\u2013lattice interactions produce new electronic phases, including interaction-induced (Mott) insulators, many forms of spin, charge and orbital ordering, and (presumably) high-transition-temperature superconductivity 1, 2.
