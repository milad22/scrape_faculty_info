            "Polarizabilities of small Si n, Ge n (n\u2264 10), and Ga n As m (n+ m\u2264 8) clusters are calculated using the higher-order finite-difference pseudopotential method in real space. We find the polarizabilities of the clusters considered to be higher than the value estimated from the \u201chard sphere\u201d model using the bulk static dielectric constant. The computed polarizabilities per atom tend to decrease with increasing the cluster size. This trend resembles the case of metallic clusters, for which the bulk limit is approached from above, and confirms the \u201cmetalliclike\u201d nature of small semiconductor clusters.",

            "The optical absorption spectra of Si n H m nanoclusters up to\u223c 250 atoms are computed using a linear response theory within the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA). The TDLDA formalism allows the electronic screening and correlation effects, which determine exciton binding energies, to be naturally incorporated within an ab initio framework. We find the calculated excitation energies and optical absorption gaps to be in good agreement with experiment in the limit of both small and large clusters. The TDLDA absorption spectra exhibit substantial blueshifts with respect to the spectra obtained within the time-independent local density approximation.",
