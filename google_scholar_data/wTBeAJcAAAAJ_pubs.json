            "Regulatory T cells (Treg) that prevent autoimmune diseases by suppression of self-reactive T cells may also suppress the immune response against cancer. In mice, depletion of Treg by Ab therapy leads to more efficient tumor rejection. Treg-mediated suppression of antitumor immune responses may partly explain the poor clinical response to vaccine-based immunotherapy for human cancer. In this study, we measured the prevalence of Treg that coexpress CD4 and CD25 in the PBLs, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and regional lymph node lymphocytes from 65 patients with either pancreas or breast cancer. In breast cancer patients (n = 35), pancreas cancer patients (n = 30), and normal donors (n = 35), the prevalence of Treg were 16.6% (SE 1.22), 13.2% (SE 1.13), and 8.6% (SE 0.71) of the total CD4+ cells, respectively. The prevalence of Treg were significantly higher in breast cancer patients (p < 0.01) and \u2026",

            "Lack of uniform reporting of negative outcomes makes interpretation of surgical literature difficult. We attempt to define and classify negative outcomes by differentiating complications, sequelae, and failures. Complications and sequelae result from procedures, adding new problems to the underlying disease. However, complications are unexpected events not intrinsic to the procedure, whereas sequelae are inherent to the procedure. Failures are events in which the purpose of the procedure is not fulfilled. We propose a classification of complications based on four grades: Grade I complications are alterations from the ideal postoperative course, non-life-threatening, and with no lasting disability. Complications of this grade necessitate only bedside procedures and do not significantly extend hospital stay. Grade II complications are potentially life-threatening but without residual disability. Within grade II complications a subdivision is made according to the requirement for invasive procedures. Grade III complications are those with residual disability, including organ resection or persistence of life-threatening conditions. Finally, grade IV complications are deaths as a result of complications. To illustrate the relevance of the classification, we reviewed 650 cases of elective cholecystectomy. Risk factors for development of complications were determined, and the classification was also used to analyze the value of a modified APACHE II as a preoperative prognostic score. Both supported the relevance of the proposed classification. The advantages of such a classification are (1) increased uniformity in reporting results,(2) the ability to compare results of \u2026",

            "Liver transplantation has enjoyed increasing success in the last decade. It has emerged from an experimental stage to become the mainstay of treatment for end-stage liver disease, with more than 4000 transplants performed annually (1-3). Despite the success of liver transplantation, rejection, infection, donor availability, and poor immediate graft function present persistent problems and contribute to mortality rates in the range of 15-25% within 1-2 years after surgery (1, 3, 4). Every liver is damaged to some extent during the transplantation process, but some livers are so severely injured that they are unable to sustain life (primary nonfunction) and, often, must be immediately retransplanted. Others show borderline function (primary dysfunction), for which patients often require prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit.

Seventeen questions were addressed. The first 7 questions focused on outcomes that reflect the benefits and risks of LLR. These questions were addressed using the Zurich-Danish consensus conference model in which the literature and expert opinion were weighed by a 9-member jury, who evaluated LLR outcomes using GRADE and a list of comparators. The jury also graded LLRs by the Balliol Classification of IDEAL.

            "Initial poor function and primary nonfunction are important problems in clinical transplantation. The incidence of primary nonfunction is about 6% and that of initial poor function is about 15%. Grafts with initial poor function have a higher graft failure rate in the first 3 mo after transplantation. Severe steatosis and cold preservation in University of Wisconsin solution for over 30 hr will alone cause primary nonfunction. However, primary nonfunction is probably most often caused by the presence of multiple relative risk factors. The major donor\u2010relative risk factors are moderate steatosis, cold preservation over 12 hr and donor age over 50 yr, whereas retransplantation, high (United Network of Organ Sharing class 4) medical status and kidney failure are recipient relative risk factors. The most important perioperative risk factor is warm ischemia time. Rates of primary nonfunction and initial poor function might be reduced \u2026",

            "We have previously defined viability limits in a rat transplantation model. All liver allografts stored in a simple preservation solution (NaCl 0.9%, CaCl2 2 mM) at 4 degrees C for 4 hr or at 37 degrees C for 1 hr were viable upon transplantation, but all those stored at 4 degrees C for 8 hr or at 37 degrees C for 2 hr were nonviable. Only cold-preserved, nonviable livers showed increased vascular resistance, platelet trapping and an initially low, but then high, rise in aspartate transaminase (AST) upon reperfusion, all suggesting injury to the microcirculation, with secondary injury to the hepatocyte. In the present study, we investigated the morphological changes that occur in livers stored for the defined critical times, using light and electron microscopy after perfusion-fixation. Accurate and reproducible identification of specimens as belonging to viable or nonviable and warm-or cold-preserved could be made in this way. Preservation in the cold first resulted in reversible changes consisting of cellular swelling, alterations of intracellular organelles, and partial denudation of the sinusoidal lining (cold-preserved viable group). Later, under conditions of nonviable cold preservation, detachment of cell bodies of sinusoidal lining cells with nuclear changes and almost complete denudation of the sinusoidal lining was observed. Endothelial cells of larger vessels were only injured mildly. In contrast, under conditions of warm preservation, changes involving mitochondria and later nuclei were found in hepatocytes, and blebbing was more extensive. Endothelial cells were spared relatively. We also examined livers stored in isotonic citrate solution at 4 degrees C for \u2026",
