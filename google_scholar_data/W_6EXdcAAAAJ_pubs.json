            "Many proposed applications of graphene require the ability to tune its electronic structure at the nanoscale 1, 2. Although charge transfer 3 and field-effect doping 4 can be applied to manipulate charge carrier concentrations, using them to achieve nanoscale control remains a challenge. An alternative approach is \u2018self-doping\u20195, in which extended defects are introduced into the graphene lattice. The controlled engineering of these defects represents a viable approach to creation and nanoscale control of one-dimensional charge distributions with widths of several atoms 6. However, the only experimentally realized extended defects so far have been the edges of graphene nanoribbons 7, 8, 9, 10, which show dangling bonds that make them chemically unstable 11, 12, 13. Here, we report the realization of a one-dimensional topological defect in graphene, containing octagonal and pentagonal sp 2-hybridized carbon \u2026",

The orientation of the diblock is controlled through a selective deprotection strategy, and a method in which the electrode\u2013electrode distance is modulated unambiguously determines the current\u2013voltage characteristics of the single-molecule device. The diblock molecule exhibits pronounced rectification behaviour compared with its homologous symmetric block, with current flowing from the dipyrimidinyl to the diphenyl moieties.

            "First-principles density-functional calculations of the atomic and electronic structure of C o\/S r T i O 3\/Co (001) magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ\u2019s) are performed. Different interface terminations are considered and the most stable structure with the TiO 2 termination is identified based on energetics of adhesion. The calculated electronic structure of the TiO 2-terminated MTJ shows an exchange coupling between the interface Co and Ti atoms mediated by oxygen. This coupling induces a magnetic moment of 0.25 \u03bc B on the interface Ti atom, which is aligned antiparallel to the magnetic moment of the Co layer. We argue that this might cause an inversion of the spin polarization of tunneling across the SrTiO 3 barrier which was found in recent experiments.",
