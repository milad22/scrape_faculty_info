            "All around us, things seem to be getting jammed. We travel on a highway and we are caught in traffic jams. At the wholefoods counter, grains and beans jam as they refuse to flow out of the bottom of the hopper into our bags. In factories, powdered raw materials clog the conduits that were designed to carry them smoothly. Our recourse in all these situations is to pound on our conduits, hoppers and dashboards until the jam miraculously disappears. We are usually so irritated that we have not really noticed that the jammed state, in all of these situations, has common properties. For example, the vibrations from the pounding actually do some good in reinitiating flow\u2014except in the case of the traffic jam. Does the jammed solid then have different properties from the solids we normally encounter in the laboratory?Writing in Physical Review Letters, Cates, Wittmer, Bouchaud and Claudin 1 contend that these jammed \u2026",

At low packing fractions \u03c6, the system is not jammed and each particle can move without impediment from its neighbors. For each configuration, there is a unique jamming threshold \u03c6 c at which particles can no longer avoid each other, and the bulk and shear moduli simultaneously become nonzero. The distribution of \u03c6 c values becomes narrower as the system size increases, so that essentially all configurations jam at the same packing fraction in the thermodynamic limit.

Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids\u2014from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter\u2014develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic \u2026",

            "Chemokines have a central role in regulating processes essential to the immune function of T cells 1, 2, 3, such as their migration within lymphoid tissues and targeting of pathogens in sites of inflammation. Here we track T cells using multi-photon microscopy to demonstrate that the chemokine CXCL10 enhances the ability of CD8+ T cells to control the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii in the brains of chronically infected mice. This chemokine boosts T-cell function in two different ways: it maintains the effector T-cell population in the brain and speeds up the average migration speed without changing the nature of the walk statistics. Notably, these statistics are not Brownian; rather, CD8+ T-cell motility in the brain is well described by a generalized L\u00e9vy walk. According to our model, this unexpected feature enables T cells to find rare targets with more than an order of magnitude more efficiency than Brownian random \u2026",

            "We calculate the distribution of interparticle normal forces P (F) near the glass and jamming transitions in model supercooled liquids and foams, respectively. P (F) develops a peak that appears near the glass or jamming transitions, whose height increases with decreasing temperature, decreasing shear stress and increasing packing density. A similar shape of P (F) was observed in experiments on static granular packings. We propose that the appearance of this peak signals the development of a yield stress. The sensitivity of the peak to temperature, shear stress, and density lends credence to the recently proposed generalized jamming phase diagram.",
