            "The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5\u03c3 point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 \u03bcm. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal \u2026",

            "We have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one of the high\u2010velocity stars in the vicinity of the Galaxy\u2019s central supermassive black hole. Both Br\u03b3 (2.1661 \u03bcm) and He i (2.1126 \u03bcm) are seen in absorption in S0\u20102 with equivalent widths (  and   \u00c5) and an inferred stellar rotational velocity (  km s\u22121) that are consistent with that of an O8\u2013B0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (\u223c15 M\u2299) young (less than 10 Myr) main\u2010sequence star. This presents a major challenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reached by S0\u20102 in its current orbit (130\u20131900 AU) and the difficulty in migrating this star inward during its lifetime from farther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation. The radial velocity measurements (  km s\u22121) and our reported proper motions for S0\u20102 strongly constrain its orbit, providing a direct measure of the black hole \u2026",

            "Long-lived emission, known as afterglow, has now been detected from about a dozen \u03b3-ray bursts. Distance determinations place the bursts at cosmological distances, with redshifts, z, ranging from\u223c 1 to 3. The energy required to produce these bright \u03b3-ray flashes is enormous: up to\u223c 10 53 erg, or 10 per cent of the rest-mass energy of a neutron star, if the emission is isotropic. Here we present optical and near-infrared observations of the afterglow of GRB990123, and we determine a redshift of z\u2a7e 1.6. This is to date the brightest \u03b3-ray burst with a well-localized position and if the \u03b3-rays were emitted isotropically, the energy release exceeds the rest-mass energy of a neutron star, so challenging current theoretical models of the sources. We argue, however, that our data may provide evidence of beamed (rather than isotropic) radiation, thereby reducing the total energy released to a level where stellar-death models \u2026",
