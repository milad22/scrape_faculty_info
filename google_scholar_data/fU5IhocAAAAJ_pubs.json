            "A rapid, sensitive and selective method is described for the determination of chromium(VI) in presence of 100-fold amounts of chromium(III) by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) in conjunction with coprecipitative preconcentration of its ethyl xanthate complex onto naphthalene. The solid mixture consisting of the chromium(VI) complex together with naphthalene is dissolved in 8.0 ml of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and chromium(VI) content was established by FAAS. Calibration graphs were rectilinear over the chromium(VI) concentration in the range 0\u2013200 \u03bcg l\u22121. Five replicate determinations of 20 \u03bcg of chromium(VI) present in 1.0 l of sample solution gave a relative standard deviation of 3.1%. The detection limit corresponding to three times the standard deviation of the blank was found to be 0.5 \u03bcg l\u22121.

Among the quinoline-8-ol and its dihaloderivatives, DBQ embedded benzophenone allows quantitative enrichment over a wide pH range (6.0\u20138.0) for both cadmium and lead unlike DCQ (\u223c6.5 for Cd and 6.5\u20137.0 for Pb), DBQ was preferred.

            "Various techniques have been employed for the determination of toxic heavy metals at trace levels in complex real samples. Direct analysis of these samples is difficult as they occur at low concentrations (near or below the limit of detection of the instrument) and are usually present in significant amounts in complex matrices (1). Suitable preconcentration separation is required to address these problems in the analysis of complex real samples containing trace\/ultratrace levels of toxic heavy metals (2). Among the various preconcentration methods, solid phase extraction (SPE) is preferred due to its simplicity, rapidity, and ability to attain a high enrichment factor; in addition, SPE is environmentally friendly. A number of sorbents such as polyurethane foam, cellulose, activated carbon, silica gel, alumina, chelating, or neutral or ion exchange resins have been widely used in SPE preconcentration separation (3-5). The application of suitable inorganic supports has several advantages over organic supports, ie, good selectivity, mechanical stability, and rapid sorption of metal ions (6).Silica gel is a very good adsorbent since it does not swell, and has good mechanical strength and thermal stability. However, for most metal ions, the interactions with the silica surface are rather weak because of the low acidity of the silanol groups (SI-OH) as well as the less pronounced donor proper-",
