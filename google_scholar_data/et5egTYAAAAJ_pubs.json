Developed in Fortran 90, the code runs on multiple platforms (Cray T3E, IBM SP, Mac clusters) and can be easily ported to new ones. Details on the code\u2019s capabilities are given. We discuss the object-oriented design of the code, the encapsulation of system dependent code and the parallelization of the algorithms involved. We also discuss the implementation of communications as a boundary condition problem and other key characteristics of the code, such as the moving window, open-space and thermal bath boundaries, arbitrary domain decomposition, 2D (cartesian and cylindric) and 3D simulation modes, electron sub-cycling, energy conservation and particle and field diagnostics. Finally results from three-dimensional simulations of particle and laser \u2026",

The model is based on the quasi-static or frozen field approximation, which reduces a fully three-dimensional electromagnetic field solve and particle push to a two-dimensional field solve and particle push. This is done by calculating the plasma wake assuming that the drive beam and\/or laser does not evolve during the time it takes for it to pass a plasma particle. The complete electromagnetic fields of the plasma wake and its associated index of refraction are then used to evolve the drive beam and\/or laser using very large time steps. This algorithm reduces the computational time by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude. Comparison between the new algorithm and conventional fully explicit models (OSIRIS) is presented. The agreement is excellent for problems of \u2026",

By thin we mean that the focal length is larger than the lens thickness. We derive analytic formulas for the spot size and pulse length evolution of a short laser pulse propagating through a thin uniform plasma lens. The formulas are compared to simulation results from two types of particle-in-cell code. The simulations give a greater final spot size and a shorter focal length than the analytic formulas. The difference arises from spherical aberrations in the lens which lead to the generation of higher-order vacuum Gaussian modes. The simulations also show that Raman side scattering can develop. A thin lens experiment could provide unequivocal evidence of relativistic self-focusing.",

We find that such distribution functions lead to lower growth rates because of space-charge forces that arise when the forward-going electrons pinch to a lesser degree than the colder, backward-flowing electrons. We verify the growth rate, range of unstable wave numbers, and the formation of the density filaments using particle-in-cell simulations.",
