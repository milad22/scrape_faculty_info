            "Shor and Grover demonstrated that a quantum computer can outperform any classical computer in factoring numbers 1 and in searching a database 2 by exploiting the parallelism of quantum mechanics. Whereas Shor's algorithm requires both superposition and entanglement of a many-particle system 3, the superposition of single-particle quantum states is sufficient for Grover's algorithm 4. Recently, the latter has been successfully implemented 5 using Rydberg atoms. Here we propose an implementation of Grover's algorithm that uses molecular magnets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which are solid-state systems with a large spin; their spin eigenstates make them natural candidates for single-particle systems. We show theoretically that molecular magnets can be used to build dense and efficient memory devices based on the Grover algorithm. In particular, one single crystal can serve as a storage unit of a dynamic random \u2026",

The overall relaxation rate as function of the longitudinal magnetic field is calculated and shown to agree well with experimental data including all resonance peaks measured so far. The Lorentzian shape of the resonances, which we obtain via a generalized master equation that includes spin tunneling, is also in good agreement with recent data. We derive a general formula for the tunnel splitting energy of these resonances. We show that fourth-order diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian lead to satellite peaks. A derivation of the effective linewidth of a resonance peak is given and shown to agree well with experimental data. In addition, previously unknown \u2026",

We found that, with increasing plasma exposure time, the photoluminescence (PL) evolves from very high intensity to complete quenching, accompanied by gradual reduction and broadening of MoS2 Raman modes, indicative of distortion of the MoS2 lattice after oxygen bombardment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study shows the appearance of the Mo6+ peak, suggesting the creation of MoO3 disordered regions in the MoS2 flake. Finally, using band structure calculations, we demonstrate that the creation of MoO3 disordered domains upon exposure to oxygen plasma leads to a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition in single-layer MoS2, which explains the observed PL quenching.",

The mobility, on-current and resistance of single-layer MoS2 devices were varied by up to four orders of magnitude by controlling the plasma exposure time. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory studies suggest that the significant variation of electronic properties is caused by the creation of insulating MoO3-rich disordered domains in the MoS2 sheet upon oxygen plasma exposure, leading to an exponential variation of resistance and mobility as a function of plasma exposure time. The resistance variation calculated using an effective medium model is in excellent agreement with the measurements. The simple approach described here can be used for the \u2026",

When the molecule is strongly coupled to metallic leads, we show that by applying a transverse magnetic field it is possible to topologically induce or quench the Kondo effect in the conductance of a SMM with either an integer or a half-integer spin S> 1\/2. This topological Kondo effect is due to the Berry-phase interference between multiple quantum tunneling paths of the spin. We calculate the renormalized Berry-phase oscillations of the two Kondo peaks as a function of the transverse magnetic field by means of the poor man\u2019s scaling. In particular, we show that the Kondo exchange interaction between itinerant electrons in the leads and the SMM pseudospin 1\/2 depends crucially on the SMM spin selection rules for the addition and subtraction of an electron and can range \u2026",
