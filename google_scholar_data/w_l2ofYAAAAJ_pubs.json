            "The spectrum of a system with multiple channels composed of two hadrons with nonzero total momentum is determined in a finite cubic volume with periodic boundary conditions using effective field theory methods. The results presented are accurate up to exponentially suppressed corrections in the volume due to the finite range of hadronic interactions. The formalism allows one to determine the phase shifts and mixing parameters of \u03c0 \u03c0\u2212 K K isosinglet coupled channels directly from lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the extension to more than two channels is straightforward and present the result for three channels. From the energy quantization condition, the volume dependence of electroweak matrix elements of two-hadron processes is extracted. In the nonrelativistic case, we pay close attention to processes that mix the S 0 1\u2212 S 1 3 two-nucleon states, eg proton-proton fusion (p p\u2192 d+ e++ \u03bd e \u2026",

This condition gives a relation between the finite volume spectrum and infinite volume scattering amplitudes. The quantization condition presented is an integral equation that in general must be solved numerically. However, for systems with an attractive two-body force that supports a two-body bound state, a diboson, and for energies below the diboson breakup, the quantization condition reduces to the well-known L\u00fcscher formula with exponential corrections in volume that scale with the diboson binding momentum. To accurately determine infinite volume phase shifts, it is necessary to extrapolate the phase shifts obtained from the L\u00fcscher formula for the boson-diboson system to the infinite volume limit.
