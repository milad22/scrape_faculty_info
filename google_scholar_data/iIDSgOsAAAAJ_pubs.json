            "Climate change, fuel security and economics are creating a requirement for alternative, renewable fuels. Bioethanol is currently produced from land-based crops but in future marine biomass could be used as an alternative biomass source for bioethanol production. Macroalgae such as Laminaria spp. grow in abundance around the United Kingdom, reaching >4 m in length and containing up to 55% dry weight of the carbohydrates laminarin and mannitol. Using enzymes, these can be hydrolysed and converted to glucose and fructose, which in turn can be utilised by yeasts to produce ethanol. In previous studies on ethanol production from macroalgae, pre-treatment was at 65\u00b0C, pH 2 for 1 h prior to fermentation. This paper shows that these pre-treatments are not required for the fermentations conducted, with higher ethanol yields being achieved in untreated fermentations than in those with altered pH or \u2026",

This study shows it can be used as a feedstock in both ethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion for methane production. The study optimised several parameters in the fermentation of L. digitata and investigated the suitability of the macroalgae through the year using samples harvested every month. For both methane and ethanol production, minimum yields were seen in material harvested in March when the carbohydrates laminarin and mannitol were lowest. July material contained the highest combined laminarin and mannitol content and maximum yields of 167 mL ethanol and 0.219 m3 kg\u22121 L. digitata.",

The structure of fucoidan has been reported to vary according to species, season, location and maturity; however there is currently little published data to support this. Understanding the seasonal variation of fucoidan is important for industrial applications to identify optimum harvesting times and ensure consistent product composition. This study explores the seasonal variation of three species of brown macroalgae, Fucus serratus (FS), Fucus vesiculosus (FV) and Ascophyllum nodosum (AN), harvested monthly off the coast of Aberystwyth, UK. Average fucoidan content is 6.0, 9.8 and 8.0 wt% respectively for FS, FV and AN, with highest quantities extracted in autumn and lowest in spring.

This has major implications if macroalgae are to be considered as a feedstock for biofuel and platform chemicals. We compared washed and unwashed material from summer and winter harvests which were subsequently dried by three methods as follows: (1) immediate oven drying, (2) freezing, then oven drying and (3) freeze-drying.

Studies were conducted on maize starch mutants amylose extender 1 (ae1), dull 1 (du1) and waxy 1 (wx1) in the inbred line Oh43 to determine whether different maize starches affected hydrolysation rates by STARGEN\u2122 001 and STARGEN\u2122 002. All mutants contained similar proportions of starch in the kernel but varied in the amylose to amylopectin ratio.

Miscanthus is predominantly used in Europe as a combustion material for electricity generation but also has the potential for biochemical conversion due to its high yield and low-nutrient requirements. The ratio of holocellulose (hemicellulose and cellulose combined) to acid detergent lignin (H:L) within the senesced material has previously been shown to indicate the relative suitability of Miscanthus accessions for thermochemical conversion. In this study, the ratio was assessed to examine its use as a selection aid for biochemical conversion. 20 highly-characterised Miscanthus accessions were saccharified using an enzyme mix to determine optimum sugar release. Nine of these accessions spanning high, medium and low H:L ratios were then autoclaved with dilute acid, alkali or water, and enzymically hydrolysed and fermented to produce ethanol. Samples taken throughout the process allowed assessments of released sugars. Enzymic degradation of the biomass showed a relationship between H:L ratio and glucose release, with high glucose release for high H:L ratio accessions and vice versa. Xylose release showed no such relationship. This relationship was maintained following pretreatments and enzyme saccharification, where compound analysis showed that following all pretreatments, accessions with high H:L ratios repeatedly had the highest releases of glucose, xylose and arabinose, and produced more ethanol. Release of all measured compounds increased \u2026",
