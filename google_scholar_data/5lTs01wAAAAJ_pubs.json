These are joined in the superconducting state at 2 K by new A and E Raman modes close in energy to the BCS gap 2 \u0394. Magnetic fields suppress the intensity of the new modes and enhance that of the CDW-induced modes, thus providing evidence of coupling between the superconducting-gap excitations and the CDW.",

Although atomic force microscopy and optical and magnetic tweezers can control single particles, it is extremely difficult to scale these technologies for multiple structures. Here, we demonstrate a \u201cnano-conveyer-belt\u201d technology that permits simultaneous transport and tracking of multiple individual nanospecies in a selected direction. The technology consists of two components: nanocontainers, which encapsulate the nanomaterials transported, and nanoconveyer arrays, which use magnetic force to manipulate individual or aggregate nanocontainers. This technology is extremely versatile. For example, nanocontainers encapsulate quantum dots or rods and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in <100 nm nanocontainers, the smallest magnetic \u2026",

This was seen by the appearance of two new Raman-active modes of different symmetry A (18 cm\u2212 1) and E (15 cm\u2212 1) when the sample is superconducting. In this paper we present further experimental details and results that confirm the theory of Balseiro and Falicov, which shows that the new modes borrow their Raman activity from low-lying charge-densitywave (CDW) phonons. Evidence of this direct coupling between superconducting electrons and the CDW phonon is seen by the behavior of the modes in a magnetic field. Such behavior of the Raman spectra is explained in terms of a model involving a complex gap. The effect of life-time broadening of the CDW phonon and consequences of varying coupling strength are presented.",

The LA-mode frequency (\u03bd LA) softens with increasing laser power in an athermal and reversible manner by nearly 30%(= \u0394 \u03bd LA\/\u03bd LA) near x= x c= 0.19 (1) or mean coordination number, r c= 2+ 2 x c= 2.38 (2), close to the mean-field rigidity percolation transition (r t= 2.40). BS is a bulk probe of elasticity, and photosoftening is maximized here when network stress is minimized near the elastic phase transition.",

            "Single cell study is gaining importance because of the cell-to-cell variation that exists within cell population, even after significant initial sorting. Analysis of such variation at the gene expression level could impact single cell functional genomics, cancer, stem-cell research, and drug screening. The on-chip monitoring of individual cells in an isolated environment would prevent cross-contamination, provide high recovery yield, and enable study of biological traits at a single cell level. These advantages of on-chip biological experiments is a significant improvement for a myriad of cell analyses methods, compared to conventional methods, which require bulk samples and provide only averaged information on cell structure and function. We report on a device that integrates a mobile magnetic trap array with microfluidic technology to provide the possibility of separation of immunomagnetically labeled cells and their \u2026",
