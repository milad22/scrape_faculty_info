            "Here, we demonstrate a previously unknown function for the 70-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP70) as a cytokine. HSP70 bound with high affinity to the plasma membrane, elicited a rapid intracellular calcium flux, activated nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in human monocytes. Furthermore, two different signal transduction pathways were activated by exogenous HSP70: one dependent on CD14 and intracellular calcium, which resulted in increased IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1; and the other independent of CD14 but dependent on intracellular calcium, which resulted in an increase in TNF-\u03b1 but not IL-1\u03b2 or IL-6. These findings indicate that CD14 is a co-receptor for HSP70-mediated signaling in human monocytes and are indicative of an previously unrecognized function for HSP70 as an extracellular protein with \u2026",

We show here that PPAR\u03b3 is expressed at high levels in both well-and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas, in normal colonic mucosa and in human colon cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of this receptor in colon cancer cells causes a considerable reduction in linear and clonogenic growth, increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and the reversal of many gene expression events specifically associated with colon cancer. Transplantable tumors derived from human colon cancer cells show a significant reduction of growth when mice are treated with troglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 ligand. These results indicate that the growth and differentiation of colon cancer cells can be modulated through PPAR\u03b3.",

Increasing concentrations of JC-1 above a certain concentration caused a linear rise in the J-aggregate fluorescence, while the monomer fluorescence remained constant. The membrane potential of energized mitochondria (negative inside) promoted a directional uptake of JC-1 into the matrix, also with subsequent formation of J-aggregates. The J-aggregate fluorescence was sensitive to transient membrane potential changes induced by ADP and to metabolic inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. The J-aggregate fluorescence was found to be pH independent within the physiologicalpH range of 7.15-8.0 and could be linearly calibrated with valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potentials.
