            "Mary Wollstonecraft first set foot on the shore of a deserted area outside Gothenburg, Sweden during the summer of 1795 after traveling for \u201celeven days of weariness on board a vessel not intended for the accommodation of passengers\u201d(63). Stepping out on that rocky coast, alone with her maid and infant daughter, she could not have known that her planned travel memoir of this unusual journey would come to exemplify quintessential elements of the emotion-laden rhetoric of self-in-text\u2014elements not only characteristic of her early romantic age but of a newly-framed discourse of selfhood in general, with close textual affinities to both the essay and the novel. Wollstonecraft\u2019s Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is a text whose literary categorization over the years\u2014when it was noticed at all\u2014has largely been that of an interesting and unusual travel book and not much more \u2026",

            "Elizabeth Barrett Browning\u2019s 1856 verse-novel Aurora Leigh was her intended magnum opus. Yet she has been taken to task by critics, both in her age and ours, for her seemingly strange hybrid use of the verse-novel form. In order to reconcile the disparity we must see this unusual text as something different from a fragmentary or not-very-successful instantiation of either genre separately but instead as a \u201cliterary self-portrait\u201d\u2014a form of polemical life narrative. I argue in this essay that Barrett Browning inherited this form from her revolutionary foremother Mary Wollstonecraft and passed it on to her modernist literary \u201cdaughter\u201d Virginia Woolf in heretofore unexamined ways.",

            "In July 1999 Princeton English professor and MLA past president Elaine Showalter came to the daring conclusion that we don\u2019t read, write, or research enough about teaching English studies, and in the Chronicle of Higher Education she describes the teaching seminar she designed with nine of her graduate students to address that glaring deficiency. Showalter (1999: B4) speaks of the \u201canxiety and uncertainty\u201d facing everyone who stands in front of a college classroom and of the skepticism of the entrenched academic culture toward any closer look at the issue of teaching:\u201cSome academics still regard popular professors with suspicion and see an interest in pedagogy as the last refuge of a scoundrel.\u201d She emphasizes the risk to her reputation of taking teaching seriously and worries about the time diverted from her graduate students\u2019\u201creal\u201d work\u2014literary research and course work\u2014to the equally serious matter of \u2026",
