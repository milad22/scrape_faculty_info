            "The linearized-augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method for thin films is generalized by removing the remaining shape approximation to the potential inside the atomic spheres. A new technique for solving Poisson's equation for a general charge density and potential is described and implemented in the film LAPW method. In the resulting full-potential LAPW method (FLAPW), all contributions to the potential are completely taken into account in the Hamiltonian matrix elements. The accuracy of the method\u2014already well known for clean metal surfaces\u2014is demonstrated for the case of a nearly free (noninteracting) O 2 molecule which is a severe test case of the method because of its large anisotropic charge distribution. Detailed comparisons show that the accuracy of the FLAPW results for O 2 exceeds that of existing state-of-the-art local-density linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO)-type calculations, and that \u2026",

We find that the ferroelectric instability in BaTiO 3 can be understood from calculations for a perfect crystal with periodic boundary conditions. The energy wells for the soft-mode distortion are deeper for rhombohedral [111] displacements relative to tetragonal [001] displacements, but they are relatively shallow and comparable to the transition temperature. The nonrigid part of the charge-density distortion is centered around the Ti ion rather than the O, and the Ti charge is closer to 2.9+ than 4+. There is significant hybridization between the Ti and O, but the Ba is quite ionic and is well described as a Ba 2+ ion. The Ti-O hybridization is essential to the ferroelectric instability.",

            "We have performed extensive self-consistent total energy calculations for PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 in order to better understand the origin of the ferroelectric instability in perovskites and the reasons for different ferroelectric behavior in the two materials. Physically reasonable ferroelectric instabilities are found for both materials at the experimental volume. However, the results are quite sensitive to volume and typical local density approximation (LDA) errors in volume can lead to significant errors in the potential surface for ferroelectric distortions. The sensitivity of the perovskite ferroelectrics to defects and chemistry, as well as the sensitivity to approximations in first principles calculations, stems from the delicate near-cancellation of long-range ionic forces which favor the instability with short-range repulsions that inhibit the ferroelectric state. The spontaneous strain is also an important feature of ferroelectrics, and we find \u2026",

            "We present a new method for treating the electronic structure of thin films which is based on a generalization of the bulk linearized augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method. This method avoids using the slab-superlattice geometry and combines the advantages of energy-independent muffin-tin Hamiltonian methods [fast root evaluation and rapid convergence for d-band metals as well as for nearly-free-electron (NFE) crystals] with the simple matrix element determination of the original augmented plane-wave (APW) method. As in the bulk LAPW method, the asymptote problem of the APW method is avoided, and the basis functions are everywhere continuous and differentiable. In addition, the film LAPW method retains such desirable features of the APW method as the ability to treat general potentials with no shape approximations, the ease with which relativistic effects can be included, and the fact that the basis \u2026",
