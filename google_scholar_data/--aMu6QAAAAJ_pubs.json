Veletri, a recently approved formulation of epoprostenol for continuous i.v. infusion, offers increased stability relative to other available epoprostenol products. Therefore, the use of Veletri can lessen the therapy burden associated with the other available formulation of the drug by allowing for the advance preparation of infusion pump cassettes (at certain concentrations) and administration at room temperature without the need for cooling with ice packs.

This study aimed to determine if lung transplant recipients with HGG are at an increased risk of developing CARV infection. Secondary endpoints included the effect of HGG on lung function, incidence of rejection, and mortality.A retrospective review of all lung transplant recipients from 2008 to 2011 was performed. Patients were stratified as either having HGG after transplantation or having normal IgG titers according to their nadir IgG level. HGG was defined a serum IgG level of <700 mg\/dL. CARVs included human metapneumovirus, influenza A\/B, respiratory syncytial virus A\/B, parainfluenza 1\/2\/3, rhinovirus, and adenovirus isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage \u2026",

            "Predicting the risk of bleeding or thrombosis in cirrhotic patients is difficult due to reduced levels and dysregulation of both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. We utilized thrombin generation and microvesicle analysis to better understand the regulation of haemostasis in cirrhotic patients. We studied 24 patients with cirrhosis vs. 21 healthy controls. Cirrhotic patients had reduced prothrombin activity (40\u00b19 vs. 112\u00b115), protein C activity (36\u00b110 vs. 114\u00b119) and antithrombin activity (43\u00b114 vs. 109\u00b110). Peak thrombin generation was reduced in cirrhotic patients (165\u00b147 vs. 232\u00b1101), but the ratio of peak thrombin generation to prothrombin activity was increased in cirrhotic patients (4.2\u00b11.0 vs. 2.1\u00b10.9) indicating a relative increase in thrombin generation in cirrhosis. The termination time ratio was increased in cirrhotic patients (7.2\u00b11.9 vs. 3.1\u00b10.7) and correlated with reduced antithrombin levels, indicating that cirrhotic patients took longer to stop thrombin generation than controls. Cirrhotic patients showed reduced procoagulant microvesicles from platelets (39 500\u00b124 800 vs. 107 700\u00b174 200) and other cells, but levels overlapped with controls. Cirrhotic patients showed a wide range of procoagulant and anticoagulant levels leading to variability in the regulation of thrombin generation. In conclusion, compared with healthy controls, patients with cirrhosis have lower antithrombin levels that lead to slower downregulation of thrombin generation and more overall thrombin being produced for a given procoagulant level in blood, but also low normal levels of procoagulant microvesicles that would slow initiation of thrombin generation.
