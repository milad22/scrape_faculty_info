            "Assemblage structure and juvenile recruitment of fishes was compared amongst three habitats: seagrass, Heterozostera tasmanica (Martens ex Aschers.) den Hartog; reef-algal; and unvegetated sand. Sampling was conducted monthly from October 1993 to March 1994 at three locations in Port Phillip Bay, southern Australia. A fine-mesh seine net was used to sample subtidally at a depth of approximately 0.5 m. Fish assemblages differed primarily between structured habitats and unvegetated sand, and a number of species previously reported to occur in seagrass habitat were also found to utilise reef-algal habitat. Species richness was highest in seagrass and lowest in unvegetated sand with significant differences amongst all habitats. Total abundance varied between habitats depending on location and month examined, but the most common pattern was highest abundance in seagrass and lowest in unvegetated \u2026",

We review potential impacts of climate change on Australian estuaries and their fish. Geographic differences are likely because southern Australian climates are predicted to become warmer and drier, whereas northern regions may see increased precipitation. Environmental factors, including salinity gradients, suspended sediment, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations, will be influenced by changing freshwater input and other climate variables. Potential impacts will vary depending on the geomorphology of the estuary and the level of build-up of sand bars across estuarine entrances.

Environmental variation can, however, produce natural chemical tags in the otoliths of juvenile fish. Spatial variation in the otolith chemistry (Ba, Sr, Mn) of age 0+ snapper collected from inlets along the coast of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, enabled characterisation of otolith chemical tags for specific areas. In particular, a tag based largely on high Ba levels was specific to snapper from the largest juvenile area and most important fishery, Port Phillip Bay. This tag enabled accurate discrimination between snapper from this bay (98 and 85%) and other Victorian nursery areas in the 2000 and 2001 year classes, respectively.

            "Chronological variation in otolith chemistry can be used to reconstruct migration histories of fish. The use of otolith chemistry to study migration, however, requires knowledge of relationships between the chemical properties of the water and elemental incorporation into otoliths, and how water chemistry varies in space and time. We explored the potential for otolith chemistry of snapper, Pagrus auratus, to provide information on movement history between a large semi-enclosed bay, Port Phillip, and coastal waters in south-eastern Australia. Comparisons of water chemistry across two years demonstrated that ambient barium (Ba) levels in Port Phillip Bay were approximately double those in coastal waters (11 \u03bcg L\u22121 versus 6 \u03bcg L\u22121). Ba levels in otolith margins of wild juvenile snapper were highly positively correlated with ambient levels across 17 sampling locations, and levels in otolith margins of adult snapper \u2026",

            " The spatial, diel and tidal variability in the abundance of piscivorous fishes and their teleost prey, and the dietary composition of predatory fishes were investigated in beds of Heterozostera tasmanica within Port Phillip Bay, Australia, from September 1997 to February 1998. Predatory and prey fish assemblages were sampled from beds of H. tasmanica at three locations during each combination of diel (day and night) and tidal (high and low) cycles. Pelagic and benthic crustaceans represented >60% by abundance of the diets of all predatory fishes. Seven species, 54% of all predatory fishes, were piscivorous. These piscivores consumed individuals from seven families, 36.8% of the fish families being associated with seagrass. Western Australian salmon, Arripis truttacea (Arripidae) (n\u2009=\u2009174) and yank flathead, Platycephalus speculator (Platycephalidae) (n\u2009=\u200946) were the most abundant piscivores.
