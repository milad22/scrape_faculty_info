            "Diluted magnetic semiconductors have received much attention due to their potential applications for spintronics devices. A prototypical system (Ga, Mn) As has been widely studied since the 1990s. The simultaneous spin and charge doping via hetero-valent (Ga 3+, Mn 2+) substitution, however, resulted in severely limited solubility without availability of bulk specimens. Here we report the synthesis of a new diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ba 1\u2212 x K x)(Zn 1\u2212 y Mn y) 2 As 2, which is isostructural to the 122 iron-based superconductors with the tetragonal ThCr 2 Si 2 (122) structure. Holes are doped via (Ba 2+, K 1+) replacements, while spins via isovalent (Zn 2+, Mn 2+) substitutions. Bulk samples with x= 0.1\u2212 0.3 and y= 0.05\u2212 0.15 exhibit ferromagnetic order with T C up to 180 K, which is comparable to the highest T C for (Ga, Mn) As and significantly enhanced from T C up to 50 K of the \u2018111\u2019-based Li (Zn, Mn) As \u2026",

Isostructural to (Ga, Mn) As, Li (Zn, Mn) P was found to be a p-type ferromagnetic semiconductor with excess lithium providing charge doping. First-principles calculations indicate that excess Li is favored to partially occupy the Zn site, leading to hole doping. Ferromagnetism with Curie temperature up to 34 K is achieved while the system still shows semiconducting transport behavior.",

No ferromagnetic order occurs with (Zn, Mn) substitution in the parent compound LaZnAsO without charge doping. Together with carrier doping via (La, Ba) substitution, a small amount of Mn substituting for Zn results in ferromagnetic order with T C up to\u223c 40 K, although the system remains semiconducting. Muon spin relaxation measurements confirm the development of ferromagnetic order in the entire volume, with the relationship between the internal field and T C consistent with the trend found in (Ga, Mn) As and the 111-type Li (Zn, Mn) As and the 122-type (Ba, K)(Zn, Mn) 2 As 2 systems.",

            "In its orthorhombic T d polymorph, MoTe 2 is a type-II Weyl semimetal, where the Weyl fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and hole pockets. Non-saturating magnetoresistance and superconductivity were also observed in T d-MoTe 2. Understanding the superconductivity in T d-MoTe 2, which was proposed to be topologically non-trivial, is of eminent interest. Here, we report high-pressure muon-spin rotation experiments probing the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth in T d-MoTe 2. A substantial increase of the superfluid density and a linear scaling with the superconducting critical temperature T c is observed under pressure. Moreover, the superconducting order parameter in T d-MoTe 2 is determined to have 2-gap s-wave symmetry. We also exclude time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state with zero-field \u03bcSR experiments. Considering the strong suppression \u2026",
