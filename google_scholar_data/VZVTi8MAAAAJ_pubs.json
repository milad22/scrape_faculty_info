The LUX cryostat was filled for the first time in the underground laboratory in February 2013. We report results of the first WIMP search data set, taken during the period from April to August 2013, presenting the analysis of 85.3 live days of data with a fiducial volume of 118 kg. A profile-likelihood analysis technique shows our data to be consistent with the background-only hypothesis, allowing 90% confidence limits to be set on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering with a minimum upper limit on the cross section of 7.6\u00d7 1 0\u2212 46 cm 2 at a WIMP mass of 33 GeV\/c 2.

            "Astrophysical observations indicate that dark matter constitutes most of the mass in our universe, but its nature remains unknown. Over the past decade, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS II) experiment has provided world-leading sensitivity for the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter. The final exposure of our low-temperature germanium particle detectors at the Soudan Underground Laboratory yielded two candidate events, with an expected background of 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 events. This is not statistically significant evidence for a WIMP signal. The combined CDMS II data place the strongest constraints on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent scattering cross section for a wide range of WIMP masses and exclude new parameter space in inelastic dark matter models.",

            "A high spectral resolution observation of the diffuse X\u2010ray background in the 60\u20131000 eV energy range has been made using an array of 36 1 mm2 microcalorimeters flown on a sounding rocket. Detector energy resolution ranged from 5 to 12 eV FWHM, and a composite spectrum of \u223c1 sr of the background centered at  ,   was obtained with a net resolution of \u223c9 eV. The target area includes bright   keV regions but avoids Loop I and the North Polar Spur. Lines of C vi, O vii, and O viii are clearly detected with intensities of  ,  , and   photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121, respectively. The oxygen lines alone account for a majority of the diffuse background observed in the ROSAT R4 band that is not due to resolved extragalactic discrete sources. We also have a positive detection of the Fe\u2010M line complex near 70 eV at an intensity consistent with previous upper limits that indicate substantial gas\u2010phase depletion of iron. We include \u2026",
