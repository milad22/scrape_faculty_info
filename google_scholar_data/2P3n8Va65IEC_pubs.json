            "This article looks at social inclusion from a sociological perspective. It argues that           sociology complements biological and other natural order explanations of social           stratification. The article interrogates a variety of forms of social integration,           including ostracism within 5th century b.c. Greece, 19th-century solidarism, and           Goffman\u2019s mid-20th-century work on stigma. It does so to demonstrate how in each of these           contexts, social inclusion and exclusion can function as apparati that problematize people           on the margins, and by extension, contribute to their governance and control. The article           proposes that sociology provides a valuable orientation from which to consider social           inclusion because it illuminates how social integration maintains and manages the ways in           which people move about and through their socially stratified worlds.",

Investigators have sought to understand a range of sexual behaviors and have scrutinized their roles in disease transmission. Opportunities have also emerged for developing and evaluating large-scale behavioral interventions to facilitate sexual risk reduction. In this article, we examine a topic of interest to sex researchers and HIV prevention programs, namely the relationship between bisexual behavior and HIV risk. We have gath ered the theoretical and empirical literatures from two countries, Canada and the United States, permitting us to describe diverse experiences in countries in which variations in demographics and social norms as well as prevention programs may have consequences for the prevalence and contexts of bisexual behavior and for HIV risk.

Simultaneously, the efficacy of some HIV prevention efforts for sex work in areas receiving US government funding has diminished. This article seeks to explain why.This analysis utilizes a case story approach to build a narrative of defining features of organizations in receipt of funding from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other US funding sources. For this analysis, multiple cases were compiled within a single narrative. This helps show restrictions imposed by the anti\u2010prostitution clause, any lack of clarity of guidelines for implementation and ways some agencies, decision\u2010making personnel, and staff on the ground contend with these restrictions.Responses to PEPFAR's anti\u2010prostitution clause vary widely and have varied over \u2026",
