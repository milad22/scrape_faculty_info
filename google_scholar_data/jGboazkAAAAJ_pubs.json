            "Bond-orientational order in molecular-dynamics simulations of supercooled liquids and in models of metallic glasses is studied. Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems. A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10% below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative\" amorphon\" cluster models \u2026",

            "A theory of dislocation-mediated melting in two dimensions is described in detail, with an emphasis on results for triangular lattices on both smooth and periodic substrates. The transition from solid to liquid on a smooth substrate takes place in two steps with increasing temperatures. Dissociation of dislocation pairs first drives a transition out of a low-temperature solid phase, with algebraic decay of translational order and long-range orientational order. This transition is into a\" liquid-crystal\" phase characterized by exponential decay of translational order, but power-law decay of sixfold orientational order. Dissociation of disclination pairs at a higher temperature then produces an isotropic fluid. The behavior of the specific heat, structure factor, and various elastic constants near these transitions is worked out. We also discuss the applicability of our results to melting on a periodic substrate. Dislocation unbinding should \u2026",

A numerical study of the Migdal recursion relation suggests that models with short-range isotropic interactions rapidly become equivalent to a simplified model system proposed by Villain. A series of exact transformations then allows us to treat the Villain model analytically at low temperatures. To lowest order in a parameter which becomes exponentially small with decreasing temperature, we reproduce results obtained previously by Kosterlitz. We also examine the effect of symmetry-breaking crystalline fields on the isotropic planar model. A numerical study of the Migdal recursion scheme suggests that these fields (which must occur in real quasi-two-dimensional crystals) are strongly relevant variables, leading to critical behavior distinct from that found for the planar model \u2026",

We discuss the equilibrium and dynamic properties of these phases, and propose a scaling theory for the flux-liquid to Bose-glass transition, at which the linear resistivity vanishes.
