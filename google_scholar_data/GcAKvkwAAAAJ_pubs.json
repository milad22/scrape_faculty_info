In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.",

The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a  or a  boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes , , and . All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb  at  TeV and 20 fb  at  TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.090.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the  decay of  and  standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.",

Theoretical calculations of this process extend to next-to-leading order (NLO)[2\u20134] and next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO)[5\u20139] perturbation theory. Crucial ingredients of the resulting QCD cross section calculations are the parametrizations of the momentum distribution functions of partons in the proton (PDFs). These have been determined recently in a variety of phenomenological analyses to NLO QCD by the CTEQ [10, 11] group and to NNLO by the MSTW [12], ABKM [13, 14], HERAPDF [15, 16], JR [17], and NNPDF [18, 19] groups.

Compared to the initial measurement by the ATLAS Collaboration [20], the data set is enlarged by 100 and the luminosity uncertainty significantly reduced [21] from 11% to 3.4%. The CMS Collaboration has updated their initial measurement of total W and Z cross sections [22] to include data corresponding to an integrated luminosity similar to that used here [23]. Similar measurements have been performed at the p\" p collider Tevatron by the CDF and D0 collaborations [24, 25]. The presented cross section values are integrated over the fiducial region of the analysis and also extrapolated to the full kinematic range. The data are also reported differentially, as functions of the lepton pseudorapidity, 3 l, for the W\u00e6 cross sections, and of the boson rapidity, yZ, for the Z= \u00c3 cross section.

The AGILE's very innovative instrumentation for the first time combines a gamma-ray imager (sensitive in the energy range 30 MeV\u201350 GeV), a hard X-ray imager (sensitive in the range 18\u201360 keV), a calorimeter (sensitive in the range 350 keV\u2013100 MeV), and an anticoincidence system. AGILE was successfully launched on 2007 April 23 from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial orbit with very low particle background.Aims. AGILE provides crucial data for the study of active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, unidentified gamma-ray sources, galactic compact objects, supernova remnants, TeV sources, and fundamental physics by microsecond timing.Methods.

            "A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair, t tH, is presented. The analysis uses 20.3 fb\u2212 1 of pp collision data at\u221a s= 8 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2012. The search is designed for the H\u2192 b b decay mode and uses events containing one or two electrons or muons. In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, events are categorised according to their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities. A neural network is used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by t t+ jets production. In the single-lepton channel, variables calculated using a matrix element method are included as inputs to the neural network to improve discrimination of the irreducible t t+b b background. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found and an observed (expected) limit of 3.4 (2.2) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained at 95% confidence level. The ratio of the measured t tH signal cross section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be \u03bc= 1. 5\u00b11. 1 assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.",
