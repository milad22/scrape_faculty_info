            "A CHARGE density wave (CDW) is a periodic symmetry-lowering redistribution of charge within a material, accompanied by a rearrangement of electronic bands (such that the total electronic energy is decreased) and usually a small periodic lattice distortion 1, 2. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in crystals of reduced symmetry, such as quasi-two-dimensional 3 or quasi-one-dimensional 4 materials. In principle, the reduction of symmetry associated with surfaces and interfaces might also facilitate the formation of CDWs; although there is some indirect evidence for surface charge density waves 5\u201312, 14, none has been observed directly. Here we report the observation and characterization of a reversible, temperature-induced CDW localized at the lead-coated (111) surface of a germanium crystal. The formation of this new phase is accompanied by significant periodic valence-charge redistribution, a \u2026",

            "\u201cNoncompensated n\u2212 p codoping\u201d is established as an enabling concept for enhancing the visible-light photoactivity of TiO 2 by narrowing its band gap. The concept embodies two crucial ingredients: The electrostatic attraction within the n\u2212 p dopant pair enhances both the thermodynamic and kinetic solubilities, and the noncompensated nature ensures the creation of tunable intermediate bands that effectively narrow the band gap. The concept is demonstrated using first-principles calculations, and is validated by direct measurements of band gap narrowing using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, dramatically redshifted optical absorbance, and enhanced photoactivity manifested by efficient electron-hole separation in the visible-light region. This concept is broadly applicable to the synthesis of other advanced functional materials that demand optimal dopant control.",

Charge ordering is accompanied by a structural distortion from (3\u00d7 3) R 30 to (3\u00d7 3) symmetry. Density-functional theory calculations are unable to correctly reproduce the observed ground state and, more importantly, indicate that Fermi surface nesting does not play a role in this transition. Both signal the importance of many-body effects in this system. Experiment and theory indicate that the Sn\/Ge (111) overlayer is fundamentally different from the Pb\/Ge (111) overlayer previously reported.",
