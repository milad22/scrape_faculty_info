            "We have cloned a novel member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The cDNA of clone 29 was isolated from a rat prostate cDNA library and it encodes a protein of 485 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 54.2 kDa. Clone 29 protein is unique in that it is highly homologous to the rat estrogen receptor (ER) protein, particularly in the DNA-binding domain (95%) and in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (55%). Expression of clone 29 in rat tissues was investigated by in situ hybridization and prominent expression was found in prostate and ovary. In the prostate clone 29 is expressed in the epithelial cells of the secretory alveoli, whereas in the ovary the granuloma cells in primary, secondary, and mature follicles showed expression of clone 29. Saturation ligand-binding analysis of in vitro synthesized clone 29 protein revealed a single binding component for 17beta-estradiol (E2) with high \u2026",

The physiological effects of these steroids are mediated by a ligand-inducible nuclear transcription factor, the oestrogen receptor (ER) 2. Hormone binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ER initiates a series of molecular events culminating in the activation or repression of target genes. Transcriptional regulation arises from the direct interaction of the ER with components of the cellular transcription machinery 3, 4. Here we report the crystal structures of the LBD of ER in complex with the endogenous oestrogen, 17\u03b2-oestradiol, and the selective antagonist raloxifene 5, at resolutions of 3.1 and 2.6 \u00c5, respectively.

Moreover, the antiestrogens tamoxifen, raloxifene, and Imperial Chemical Industries 164384 were potent transcriptional activators with ER\u03b2 at an AP1 site.

            "During the past decade there has been a substantial advance in our understanding of estrogen signaling both from a clinical as well as a preclinical perspective. Estrogen signaling is a balance between two opposing forces in the form of two distinct receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) and their splice variants. The prospect that these two pathways can be selectively stimulated or inhibited with subtype-selective drugs constitutes new and promising therapeutic opportunities in clinical areas as diverse as hormone replacement, autoimmune diseases, prostate and breast cancer, and depression. Molecular biological, biochemical, and structural studies have generated information which is invaluable for the development of more selective and effective ER ligands. We have also become aware that ERs do not function by themselves but require a number of coregulatory proteins whose cell-specific expression explains some of the \u2026",

            "The estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the steroid hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol, in both males and females. Since the isolation and cloning of ER, the consensus has been that only one such receptor exists.The finding of a second subtype of ER (ER\u03b2) has caused considerable excitement amongst endocrinologists. In this article, we present data regarding the genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the human ER\u03b2 gene, demonstrating that two independent ER genes do exist in the human. Furthermore, we present data regarding the tissue distribution of human ER\u03b2, showing that this receptor is expressed in multiple tissues. For instance, ER\u03b2 is found in developing spermatids of the testis, a finding of potential relevance for the ongoing debate on the effects of environmental estrogens on sperm counts. In addition, we find ER\u03b2 in ovarian granulosa \u2026",
