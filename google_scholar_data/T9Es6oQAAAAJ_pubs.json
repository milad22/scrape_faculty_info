It is shown that the degeneracy is removed if terms in the free energy of order (L \u03bb) 4 are taken into account, yielding both a unique structure and a preferred orientation of the vortex lattice with respect to the direction of B within the crystal. Parameters of the primitive cell for this structure are obtained and evaluated for known values of the anisotropy of Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7.

            "Irreversible magnetic properties of Ba (Fe 0.93 Co 0.07) 2 As 2 single crystals were studied by using several techniques including transport, magnetization, and magneto-optics. The mixed-state response was found to be very similar to high-T c cuprates, such as Y-Ba-Cu-O and Nd-Ce-Cu-O. In particular, we find a nonmonotonic \u201cfishtail\u201d shape of the magnetization loops M (T= const, H) and a corresponding feature in M (T, H= const) scans, as well as a very large magnetic relaxation rate. The supercurrent density, j, in the critical state was evaluated from magnetization and from direct transport measurements close to T c. At 5 K we estimate a moderate j\u2248 2.6\u00b10.2\u00d7 10 5 A\/cm 2. Analysis of the temperature and field dependencies of the magnetic relaxation is consistent with the collective pinning and creep (weak pinning and fast creep) model and suggests a crossover from the collective to the plastic creep regime in \u2026",

It is shown\u2014in agreement with experimental data\u2014that particles of high-T c materials at T< T c must orient with their c axis normal to the applied field. The torque acting on a particle is evaluated and shown to be independent of the ellipsoid shape. The torque is associated with the magnetization component perpendicular to the field direction.",

            "Nonlocal corrections to the London model are used to describe vortex lattices in LuNi 2 B 2 C. Within this scheme in fields along the c axis, vortices should form a square lattice (rotated 45 relative to the crystal axes afandfb) at large fields, should transform to a triangular one at a field H 2, and to another triangular lattice at a still lower field H 1. We argue that the transition at H 2 is of second order, whereas at H 1 it is of first order. In tilted fields, H 2 is predicted to move to higher fields. Neutron-scattering data for ErNi 2 B 2 C are discussed.",
