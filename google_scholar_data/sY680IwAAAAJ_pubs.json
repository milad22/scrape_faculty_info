In the case of minimal supergravity it is found that for low tan \u03b2 and for low values of fine-tuning \u03a6, where \u03a6 is defined essentially by the ratio \u03bc 2\/M Z 2 where \u03bc is the Higgs mixing parameter and M Z is the Z boson mass, the allowed values of the universal scalar parameter m 0, and the universal gaugino mass m 1\/2 lie on the surface of an ellipsoid with radii fixed by \u03a6 leading to tightly constrained upper bounds\u223c \u03a6. Thus for tan \u03b2<~ 2 (<~ 5) it is found that the upper limits for the entire set of sparticle masses lie in the range< 700 GeV (< 1.5 TeV) for any reasonable range of fine-tuning (\u03a6<~ 2 0).

            "Recently WMAP has measured the cosmological parameters to a much greater accuracy. We analyze the implications of this more precise measurement for supersymmetric dark matter and for the direct detection of supersymmetry at accelerators. We consider MSUGRA including also the hyperbolic branch (HB) in the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry. On the part of the hyperbolic branch where the lightest neutralino is dominantly a Higgsino rather than being mostly a B-ino, the relic density constraints are satisfied by coannihilation with the next lightest neutralino and the light chargino. Including this branch the lightest neutralino mass satisfies m \u03c7 1 0<~ 1200 GeV for tan \u03b2<~ 50. Constraints of b\u2192 s+ \u03b3, of g \u03bc\u2212 2, and of B s 0\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 are also analyzed.

            "A full analytic analysis of the effects of CP violating phases on the event rates in the direct detection of dark matter in the scattering of neutralinos from nuclear targets is given. The analysis includes CP violating phases in softly broken supersymmetry in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model when generational mixings are ignored. A numerical analysis shows that large CP violating phases including the constraints from the experimental limits on the neutron and the electron electric dipole moment can produce substantial effects on the event rates in dark matter detectors.",

We have studied the constraints on the minimal anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) model using the current data of muon g\u2212 2 from Brookhaven. A scenario of seeing no deviation from the standard model is also considered, within a 2 \u03c3 limit of the combined error from the standard model result and the Brookhaven predicted uncertainty level. The resulting constraint is found to be complementary to what one obtains from b\u2192 s+ \u03b3 bounds within the AMSB scenario, since only a definite sign of \u03bc is effectively probed via b\u2192 s+ \u03b3. A few relevant generic features of the model are also described for disallowed regions of parameter space.",
