            "The kinetics of interaction of nitrous oxides (NOx) with SnO2 sensor surfaces were investigated. It is shown that NO, similar to CO, undergoes a simple reducing interaction with SnO2 sensor surfaces producing a conductivity increase. In comparison, NO2 was found to exhibit a highly complex behaviour. At surface temperatures lower than 200\u00b0C, NO2 was found to reversibly oxidise SnO2 surfaces independently of the NO2 concentrations applied. In this latter case, reduced conductivities were observed. Approaching surface temperatures of the order of 400\u00b0C, a reducing interaction took over which gave way to the normally observed oxidising behaviour as NO2 concentrations above 1 ppm were applied. In this latter high-temperature\/high-concentration regime, poisoning effects were observed which caused the sensor resistance baseline to drift away. These latter results indicated that the poisoning effect of NO2 on \u2026",

Depending on gate porosity, either selective hydrogen sensors or sensors with a broad-band sensitivity towards a range of reducing and oxidizing gas species can be made. Applying porous Pt electrodes and sensor operation temperatures of about 400 \u00b0C, hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), acetylene (C2H2) and nitrous oxide (NO2) could be detected via sizable changes in the source drain current.",

We show that such distributions are determined by two energetic parameters, which are specific for the special adsorbate\/adsorbent system involved.

We find that at normal sensor operation temperatures of the order of 400\u00b0C thin-film devices mainly respond to oxidising gases such as O3 and NO2, whereas thick-film ones preferably respond to reducing species like CO and CH4. A significant response towards oxidising species, however, was observed upon reducing the operation temperature of the thick-film devices to about 100\u00b0C. We explain these effects in terms of a simple diffusion-reaction model taking into account the different architectures of thin- and thick-film gas sensing devices.",

            "In the present article recent results concerning sensor applications of AlGaN layers and AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures are summarized. The piezoresistive effect in piezoelectric AlGaN layers is investigated and the dependence of the piezoresistive gauge factor on the Al content is attributed to the influence of strain induced piezoelectric fields. An enhancement of this effect is observed in AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures resulting in high longitudinal gauge factors.The response of gas sensitive Pt:GaN Schottky diodes to hydrogen and hydrogen containing gases is analyzed up to temperatures of 600 \u00b0C and employed to realize gas sensitive field effect transistors which are demonstrated to operate up to 400 \u00b0C. In addition, ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs) have also been fabricated on the basis of AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures. The GaN surface shows a high pH sensitivity which is attributed to the presence of a \u2026",
