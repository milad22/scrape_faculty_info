            "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",

Photon candidates are identified by combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate. The results are compared to predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.",

            "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton\u2013proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s\u221a=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson, for  20\u2264pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |\u03b7|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |\u03b7|<1.2 ) for jets with  55\u2264pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |\u03b7|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating \u2026",
