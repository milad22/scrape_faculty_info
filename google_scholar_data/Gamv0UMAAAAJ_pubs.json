In a mouse breast adenocarcinoma model, fluorescently labeled pHLIP finds solid acidic tumors with high accuracy and accumulates in them even at a very early stage of tumor development. The fluorescence signal is stable for >4 days and is approximately five times higher in tumors than in healthy counterpart tissue. In a rat antigen-induced arthritis model, pHLIP preferentially accumulates in inflammatory foci. pHLIP also maps the renal cortical interstitium; however, kidney accumulation can be reduced significantly by providing mice with bicarbonate-containing drinking water. The peptide has three states: soluble in water, bound to the surface of a membrane, and inserted across the membrane as an \u03b1-helix. At \u2026",

            "Solid tumors often develop an acidic environment due to the Warburg effect. The effectiveness of diagnosis and therapy may therefore be enhanced by the design and use of pH-sensitive agents that target acidic tumors. Recently, a novel technology was introduced to target acidic tumors using pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP), a peptide that inserts across cell membranes as an \u03b1-helix when the extracellular pH (pHe) is acidic. In this study, we expanded the application of the pHLIP technology to include positron emission tomography imaging of the acidic environment in prostate tumors using 64Cu conjugated to the pHLIP (64Cu-DOTA-pHLIP). Studies showed that this construct avidly accumulated in LNCaP and PC-3 tumors, with higher uptake and retention in the LNCaP tumors. Uptake correlated with differences in the bulk pHe of PC-3 and LNCaP tumors measured in magnetic resonance spectroscopy \u2026",

Using the pH-triggered insertion of the pH low insertion peptide to enable kinetic analysis, we show that insertion occurs in several steps, with rapid (0.1 sec) interfacial helix formation, followed by a much slower (100 sec) insertion pathway to give a transmembrane helix. The reverse process of unfolding and peptide exit from the bilayer core, which can be induced by a rapid rise of the pH from acidic to basic, proceeds approximately 400 times faster than folding\/insertion and through different intermediate states. In the exit pathway, the helix\u2013coil transition is initiated while the polypeptide is still inside the membrane. The peptide starts to exit when about 30% of the helix is unfolded, and continues a rapid exit as it unfolds inside the membrane.

It has been observed that many diseased tissues are acidic and that tumors are especially so. A combination of effects acidifies tumor cell interiors, and cells pump out lactic acid and protons to maintain intracellular pH, acidifying the extracellular space. Overexpression of carbonic anhydrases on cell surfaces further contributes to acidification. Thus, the pH near tumor cell surfaces is expected to be low and to increase with distance from the membrane, so bulk pH measurements will not report surface acidity. Our new surface pH-measurement tool was validated in cancer cells grown in spheroids, in mouse tumor models in vivo, and in excised tumors.
