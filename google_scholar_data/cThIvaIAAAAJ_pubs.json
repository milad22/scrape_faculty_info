            "Increasing evidence has shown that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could transdifferentiate into Schwann cell (SC)-like cells to enhance nerve regeneration, suggesting potential new cell-based transplantation therapy for peripheral nerve injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. For the implementation of these results to the clinical setting, it is of great importance to establish the differentiation of human ASCs (hASCs) into a SC phenotype. In this study, we studied hASCs obtained from subcutaneous fat tissue of healthy donors. By a mixture of glial growth factors we differentiated them into Schwann cell-like cells (dhASCs). We then assessed their ability to act as Schwann cells in vitro and in vivo and also compared them with primary human Schwann cells (hSCs). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that dhASCs secreted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)\/nerve growth factor (NGF) at a \u2026",

            "Axons of the adult central nervous system have very limited ability to regenerate after injury. This inability may be, at least partly, attributable to myelin\u2010derived proteins, such as myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein, Nogo and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein. Recent evidence suggests that these proteins inhibit neurite outgrowth by activation of Rho through the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR\/Nogo receptor complex. Despite rapidly growing knowledge on these signals at the molecular level, it remained to be determined whether Rho is activated after injury to the central nervous system. To assess this question, we establish a new method to visualize endogenous Rho activity in situ. After treatment of cerebellar granular neurons with the Nogo peptide in vitro, Rho is spatially activated and colocalizes with p75NTR. Following spinal cord injury in vivo, massive activation of Rho is observed in the injured neurites. Spatial \u2026",

After nerve injury, the distal axonal and myelin segment undergoes dissolution and absorption by the surrounding cellular environment, a process called Wallerian degeneration. Using cDNA microarrays, we isolated FLRT3 as one of the up-regulated genes expressed in the distal segment of the sciatic nerve 7 days after transection relative to those of the intact sciatic nerve. FLRT3 is a putative type I transmembrane protein containing 10 leucine-rich repeats, a fibronectin type III domain, and an intracellular tail. The neurons plated on CHO cells expressing FLRT3 extended significantly longer neurites than those plated on wild-type CHO cells, demonstrating that FLRT3 promotes neurite outgrowth.

One of these cues, Slit protein, plays an important role in neuronal migration and axonal guidance through the interaction with Roundabout (Robo) receptor. It was reported that the signal from Robo is transmitted to a specific family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) named Slit\u2013Robo GAPs. The Slit\u2013Robo GAPs (srGAPs) further transmit the signal to the actin cytoskeleton controlling Rho GTPases and thus provide a direct link between Slit\u2013Robo signaling and actin cytoskeleton.We examined the effects of facial nerve transection on srGAP2 mRNA expression in the facial nerve nuclei by in situ hybridization.

Between Groups I and II, there were no significant differences in the functional, electrophysiologic, and histologic evaluations. In retrograde tracing of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, the number of double-labeled neurons was significantly higher in Group I.
