We use electron paramagnetic resonance at 240 GHz and 8 T to study the electron-spin coherence time T 2 of nitrogen-vacancy centers and nitrogen impurities in diamond from room temperature down to 1.3 K. A sharp increase of T 2 is observed below the Zeeman energy (11.5 K). The data are well described by a suppression of the flip-flop induced spin bath fluctuations due to thermal electron-spin polarization. T 2 saturates at\u223c 250 \u03bc s below 2 K, where the polarization of the electron-spin bath exceeds 99%.",

Applications such as quantum information processing depend on understanding it; there are even fundamental theories proposed that go beyond quantum mechanics 1, 2, 3, in which the breakdown of quantum theory would appear as an \u2018intrinsic\u2019decoherence, mimicking the more familiar environmental decoherence processes 4. Such applications cannot be optimized, and such theories cannot be tested, until we have a firm handle on ordinary environmental decoherence processes. Here we show that the theory for insulating electronic spin systems can make accurate and testable predictions for environmental decoherence in molecular-based quantum magnets 5. Experiments on molecular magnets have successfully demonstrated quantum-coherent phenomena 6, 7, 8 but the decoherence processes that ultimately limit such behaviour were not well \u2026",

The temperature dependence of the spin decoherence time T 2 measured by high-frequency pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance indicates that strong spin decoherence is dominated by Fe 8 spin bath fluctuations. By polarizing the spin bath in Fe 8 single-molecule magnets at magnetic field B= 4.6 T and temperature T= 1.3 K, spin decoherence is significantly suppressed and extends the spin decoherence time T 2 to as long as 712 ns. A second decoherence source is likely due to fluctuations of the nuclear spin bath.

However, the application of such techniques within the limited space of a high-field magnet presents significant technical challenges. We describe a 7.62mm\u00d77.62mm (diameter\u00d7length) rotating cylindrical cavity which overcomes these problems. The cylinder is mounted transverse to the bore of the magnet, coupling is achieved through the sidewalls of the cavity, and the end plate is then rotated (by means of an external drive) instead of the body of the cavity itself. Therefore, rotation does not affect the cylindrical geometry, or the mechanical connections to the incoming waveguides. The TE011 mode frequency of the cavity is 51.863GHz, with the \u2026",

More importantly, on the basis of the angle dependence of fine structures observed in the EPR spectra we infer that the tilt distribution must be discrete, as was previously suspected from studies which demonstrated the presence of a locally varying rhombic anisotropy [S. Hill et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 217204 (2003)]. The tilts are confined to two orthogonal planes, and the distribution extends up to\u223c 1.7 degrees away from the global easy (z) axis. We ascribe the tilting to the hydrogen-bonding effect associated with the disordered acetic acid solvent molecules. The effect is considerably larger than deduced from x-ray diffraction analyses.

Using the spin coherent-state P-representation method, we simulate coherence evolution of the NV center coupled to surrounding nitrogen electron (N) spins. In the system, the strength of NN coupling is the same order as that of NV-N coupling (the strong intrabath coupling regime). We find that spin decoherence time as well as free-induction decay of the NV center depend on the spatial configuration of N spins. Both the spin decoherence rate (1\/T 2) and dephasing rate (1\/T 2*) of the NV center increase linearly with the concentration of the N spins. Using the P-representation method, we also demonstrate extracting the noise spectrum of the N spin bath. The capability to calculate the noise spectrum will provide promising pathways to suppress decoherence of spin systems in the strong intrabath coupling regime.",
