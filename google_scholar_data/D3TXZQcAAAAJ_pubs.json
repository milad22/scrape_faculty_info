            "As a form of matter intermediate between molecules and bulk solids, atomic clusters have been much studied 1. Light-induced processes in clusters can lead to photo-fragmentation 2, 3 and Coulombic fission 4, producing atom and ion fragments with a few electronvolts (eV) of energy. However, recent studies of thephotoionization of atomic clusters with high intensity (> 10 16 W cm\u2212 2) femtosecond laser pulses have shown that these interactions can be far more energetic 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\u2014excitation of large atomic clusters can produce a superheated microplasma that ejects ions with kinetic energies up to 1 MeV (ref. 10). This phenomenon suggests that through irradiation of deuterium clusters, it would be possible to create plasmas with sufficient average ion energy for substantial nuclear fusion. Here we report the observation of nuclear fusion from the explosions of deuterium clusters heated with a \u2026",

            "We present theoretical and experimental evidence that nonionizing prepulses with intensities as low as 10 8\u201310 9 W\/c m 2 can substantially alter high intensity laser-solid interactions. We show that prepulse-heating and vaporization of the target can lead to a preformed plasma once the vapor is ionized by the rising edge of the high-intensity pulse. Our results indicate that peak prepulse intensity is not the only important parameter to consider in determining preformed plasma thresholds, and that a more comprehensive analysis of the prepulse duration and the target material is required.",
