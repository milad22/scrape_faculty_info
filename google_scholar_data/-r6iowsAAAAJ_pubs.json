The electronic states around the Fermi level are formed by partially filled Cu 3d  x\u00b2\u2212y\u00b2 orbitals with significant admixture of O 2p states. Theoretical spectra are calculated using DFT + U electronic structure method and their comparison with experimental photoemission and optical spectra show very good agreement.",

Our first principle, non-relativistic and ground state calculations employed a local density functional approximation (LDA) potential and the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). Within the framework of the Bagayoko\u2013Zhao\u2013Williams (BZW) method, we solved self-consistently both the Kohn\u2013Sham equation and the equation giving the ground state charge density in terms of the wave functions of the occupied states. Our calculated band structure shows that there is significant O 2p\u2013Ti 3d hybridization in the valence bands. These bands are well separated from the conduction bands by an indirect band gap of 2.95 eV, from \u0393 to R. Consequently, this work predicts that rutile TiO 2 is an indirect band gap material, as all other gaps from our calculations are larger than 2.95 eV. We \u2026",

Analysis of the accumulated data showed in all cases, that the highest percentage (%) proximate composition of the staple food crops is carbohydrate followed by crude protein, moisture, crude fibre, ash and fat for cereals and legumes while in tubers, moisture is the highest. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that there is no significant location effect in the crude protein contents of cereals, legumes and tubers at the time of harvest (P< 1.000).",

We solved self-consistently the two inherently coupled equations of density functional theory (DFT), following the Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams (BZW) method as enhanced by the work of Ekuma and Franklin (BZW-EF). We employed a local density approximation (LDA) potential and the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). Most of the calculated, electronic properties of w-ZnO are in excellent agreement with experiment, including our zero temperature band gap of 3.39 eV and the electron effective mass. The doubly self-consistent approach utilized in this work points to the ability of theory to predict accurately key properties of semiconductors and hence to inform and to guide the design and fabrication of semiconductor-based devices.",
