            "For over 30 years, researchers have investigated students\u2019 ideas about energy with the intent of reforming instructional practice. In this pursuit, Watts contributed an influential study with his 1983 paper \u201cSome alternative views of energy\u201d[Phys. Educ. 18, 213 (1983)]. Watts\u2019\u201calternative frameworks\u201d continue to be used for categorizing students\u2019 non-normative ideas about energy. Using a resources framework, we propose an alternate analysis of student responses from Watts\u2019 interviews. In our analysis, we show how students\u2019 activated resources about energy are disciplinarily productive. We suggest that fostering seeds of scientific understandings in students\u2019 ideas about energy may play an important role in their development of scientific literacy.",

            "When students share and explore chemistry ideas with others, they use gestures and their bodies to perform their understanding. As a publicly visible, spatio\u2013dynamic medium of expression, gestures and the body provide productive resources for imagining the submicroscopic, three-dimensional, and dynamic phenomena of chemistry together. In this paper, we analyze the role of gestures and the body as interactional resources in interactive spaces for collaborative meaning-making in chemistry. With our moment-by-moment analysis of video-recorded interviews, we demonstrate how creating spaces for, attending to, and interacting with students\u2019 gestures and bodily performances generate opportunities for learning. Implications for teaching and assessment that are responsive to students\u2019 ideas in chemistry are discussed.",

            "Energy is a crosscutting concept in science and features prominently in national science education documents. In the Next Generation Science Standards, the primary conceptual learning goal is for learners to conserve energy as they track the transfers and transformations of energy within, into, or out of the system of interest in complex physical processes. As part of tracking energy transfers among objects, learners should (i) distinguish energy from matter, including recognizing that energy flow does not uniformly align with the movement of matter, and should (ii) identify specific mechanisms by which energy is transferred among objects, such as mechanical work and thermal conduction. As part of tracking energy transformations within objects, learners should (iii) associate specific forms with specific models and indicators (e.g., kinetic energy with speed and\/or coordinated motion of molecules, thermal energy with \u2026",

However, the elicitation, assessment, and subsequent instruction that characterize proximal formative assessment are also seen in discourse among peers. We present a case in which secondary teachers in a professional development course at SPU are discussing energy flow in refrigerators. In this episode, a peer is invited to share her thinking (elicitation). Her idea that refrigerators move heat from a relatively cold compartment to a hotter environment is inappropriately judged as incorrect (assessment). The \"instruction\" (peer explanation) that follows is based on the second law of thermodynamics, and acts as corrective rather than collaborative.",
