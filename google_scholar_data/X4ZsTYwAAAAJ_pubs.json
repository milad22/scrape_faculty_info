            "We develop a point-spread function (PSF) engineering approach to imaging the spatial and spectral information of molecular emissions using a spatial light modulator (SLM). We show that a dispersive grating pattern imposed upon the emission reveals spectral information. We also propose a deconvolution model that allows the decoupling of the spectral and 3D spatial information in engineered PSFs. The work is readily applicable to single-molecule measurements and fluorescent microscopy.",
