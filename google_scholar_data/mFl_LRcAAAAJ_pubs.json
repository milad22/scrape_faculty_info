Temperature-programmed reaction studies of the catalyzed combustion of CO on size-selected small monodispersed Aun (n \u2264 20) gold clusters supported on magnesia, and first-principle simulations, reveal the microscopic origins of the observed unusual catalytic activity, with Au8 found to be the smallest catalytically active size. Partial electron transfer from the surface to the gold cluster and oxygen-vacancy F-center defects are shown to play an essential role in the activation of nanosize gold clusters as catalysts for the combustion reaction.

Charging of the supported clusters plays a key role in promoting their chemical activity. Infrared measurements of the stretch vibration of CO adsorbed on mass-selected gold octamers soft-landed on MgO(001) with coadsorbed O2 show a red shift on an F-center\u2013rich surface with respect to the perfect surface. The experiments agree with quantum ab initio calculations that predict that a red shift of the C\u2013O vibration should arise via electron back-donation to the CO antibonding orbital.",
