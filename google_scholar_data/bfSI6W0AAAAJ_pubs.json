            "Many researchers, especially those new to the field, need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy, either for the purposes of their own research, or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review. 1 Acceptable standards are an important issue, particularly considering that each of us may have his\/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately, the answer is in part a \u201cmoving target\u201d as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria, only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas. Conversely, as a reviewer, it is tiresome to raise the same objections repeatedly, wondering why researchers have not fulfilled some of the basic requirements for establishing the occurrence of an autophagic process.

            "Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in \u2026",

Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined \u2026",

            "HIV-1 sequences were analyzed to estimate the timing of the ancestral sequence of the main group of HIV-1, the strains responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Using parallel supercomputers and assuming a constant rate of evolution, we applied maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods to unprecedented amounts of data for this calculation. We validated our approach by correctly estimating the timing of two historically documented points. Using a comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment, we estimated the date of the last common ancestor of the main group of HIV-1 to be 1931 (1915\u201341). Analysis of a gag gene alignment, subregions of envelope including additional sequences, and a method that relaxed the assumption of a strict molecular clock also supported these results.",

            "A first attempt to classify HIV-1 sequences was to subdivide them into European\/North American and African strains, as sequences derived from European and North American isolates formed a distinct cluster in phylogenetic trees, while strains from Africa separated into different lineages (Li et al. 1988; Myers et al. 1988). However, when additional sequences from other geographic regions became available, it was clear that this classification system was too limited. Instead phylogenetic analysis of envelope sequences revealed the existence of multiple phylogenetic clusters, or clades, which were approximately equidistant from one another. These clades were named subtypes A to F, with the prototypic \u201cNorth-American\/European\u201d strains relabelled subtype B (Myers et al. 1992). Subsequently, five of these six env-based subtypes\/clades (A, B, C, D and F, but not subtype E) were identified in phylogenies inferred from the gag region (Louwagie et al. 1993). In the following years four additional subtypes, G to J, were characterized based on phylogenetic comparisons of partial sequences (Janssens et al. 1994; Kostrikis et al. 1995; Leitner et al. 1995; Louwagie et al. 1995). More recently, subtype F was reported to be comprised of sub-subtypes F1, F2 and F3 based upon gag and env phylogenetic comparisons (Triques et al. 1999), but after subsequent analysis of complete genomes, sub-subtype F3 was renamed subtype K (Triques et al. 2000).[The latter subtype \u201cK\u201d should not be confused with partial sequences recently designated as \u201ck\u201d which cluster as a sister clade to subtype D (Roques et al. 1999).] Collectively all of the HIV-1 subtypes group \u2026",
