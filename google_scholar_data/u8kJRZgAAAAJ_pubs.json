            "DNA is probably the molecule that carries the highest possible density of information. Information comes along with structuring and recognition that offer the possibility of using DNA to build self-assembled molecular circuits for nanoelectronics applications. This, however, must be complemented by suitable conductivity, which was tested in a series of experiments on charge migration along DNA molecules. These issues together with reports on possible high rates of charge transfer between donor and acceptor through the DNA, obtained in the last decade from solution chemistry experiments on large numbers of molecules, triggered a series of direct electrical transport measurements through DNA single molecules, bundles and networks. These measurements are reviewed and presented here. From these experiments we conclude that electrical transport is feasible in short DNA \u2026",

            "A classical atomistic force field to describe the interaction of proteins with gold (111) surfaces in explicit water has been devised. The force field is specifically designed to be easily usable in most common bio-oriented molecular dynamics codes, such as GROMACS and NAMD. Its parametrization is based on quantum mechanical (density functional theory [DFT] and second order M\u00f6ller-Plesset perturbation theory [MP2]) calculations and experimental data on the adsorption of small molecules on gold. In particular, a systematic DFT survey of the interaction between Au (111) and the natural amino acid side chains has been performed to single out chemisorption effects. Van der Waals parameters have been instead fitted to experimental desorption energy data of linear alkanes and were also studied via MP2 calculations. Finally, gold polarization (image charge effects) is taken into account by a recently proposed \u2026",

This approach provides the framework for the integration of DNA sequence and shape analyses in genome-wide studies. The HT methodology uses a sliding-window approach to mine DNA structural information obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. It requires only nucleotide sequence as input and instantly predicts multiple structural features of DNA (minor groove width, roll, propeller twist and helix twist). The results of rigorous validations of the HT predictions based on DNA structures solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, hydroxyl radical cleavage data, statistical analysis and cross-validation, and molecular dynamics simulations provide strong confidence in this approach.

A number of different adsorption modes are examined, including adsorption through the thiol group in either thiolate or disulfide form, and adsorption through both the thiol and amino functional groups. We find that at intermediate coverage densities the latter mode of adsorption is favored, followed by thiolate adsorption at the bridge (slightly displace toward fcc) site. The N\u2013Au and S\u2013Au bond strengths in the amino-thiolate adsorption are estimated to be of the order of 6 and 47 kcal\/mol, respectively.

Currents ranging from tens of picoamperes to more than 100 pA were measured in the G4-DNA over distances ranging from tens of nanometres to more than 100 nm.

            "By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we study the adsorption of pentacene on copper as a model for the coupling between aromatic molecules and metal surfaces. Our results for the interface electronic structure are not compatible with a purely physisorption picture, which is conventionally employed for such systems. Nay, we demonstrate electronic mixing between molecular orbitals and metal electronic states.",
