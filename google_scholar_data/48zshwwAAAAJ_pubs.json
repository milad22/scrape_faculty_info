            "This article refers to the different learning problems that the students present and that should have detected in time by the teachers so that they receive the pedagogical intervention in a timely manner. Among these difficulties are learning disorders, such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, discography, dyslalia, and attention deficit and hyperactivity. The objective is to meet the educational needs of students with appropriate strategies and methodologies to avoid school failure; the methodology used was a bibliographic review to find out the causes and the treatment that the teacher must apply in the teaching-learning process of the student.",
