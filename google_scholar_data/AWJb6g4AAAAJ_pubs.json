            "Using improved, self\u2010consistent analysis techniques, we determine the average solar wind charge state and elemental composition of nearly 40 ion species of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe observed with the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer on Ulysses. We compare results obtained during selected time periods, including both slow solar wind and fast streams, concentrating on the quasi\u2010stationary flows away from recurrent or intermittent disturbances such as corotating interaction regions or coronal mass ejections. In the fast streams the charge state distributions are consistent with a single freezing\u2010in temperature for each element, whereas in the slow wind these distributions appear to be composed of contributions from a range of temperatures. The elemental composition shows the well\u2010known first ionization potential (FIP) bias of the solar wind composition with respect to the photosphere. However \u2026",

            "Observations of solar wind from both large polar coronal holes (PCHs) during Ulysses' third orbit showed that the fast solar wind was slightly slower, significantly less dense, cooler, and had less mass and momentum flux than during the previous solar minimum (first) orbit. In addition, while much more variable, measurements in the slower, in\u2010ecliptic wind match quantitatively with Ulysses and show essentially identical trends. Thus, these combined observations indicate significant, long\u2010term variations in solar wind output from the entire Sun. The significant, long\u2010term trend to lower dynamic pressures means that the heliosphere has been shrinking and the heliopause must be moving inward toward the Voyager spacecraft. In addition, our observations suggest a significant and global reduction in the mass and energy fed in below the sonic point in the corona. The lower supply of mass and energy may result \u2026",

The recently launched Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has completed its first all-sky maps of the interstellar interaction at the edge of the heliosphere by imaging energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) emanating from this region. We found a bright ribbon of ENA emission, unpredicted by prior models or theories, that may be ordered by the local interstellar magnetic field interacting with the heliosphere. This ribbon is superposed on globally distributed flux variations ordered by both the solar wind structure and the direction of motion through the interstellar medium. Our results indicate that the external galactic environment strongly imprints the heliosphere.",

IBEX is designed to achieve this objective by answering four fundamental science questions: (1) What is the global strength and structure of the termination shock, (2) How are energetic protons accelerated at the termination shock, (3) What are the global properties of the solar wind flow beyond the termination shock and in the heliotail, and (4) How does the interstellar flow interact with the heliosphere beyond the heliopause? The answers to these questions rely on energy-resolved images of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), which originate beyond the termination shock, in the inner heliosheath.

A mid\u2010sized circumpolar coronal hole that formed around solar maximum in the northern hemisphere has persisted and produced a highly inclined CIR, which was observed from \u223c70\u00b0N down to \u223c30\u00b0N. We find that the speed maxima in the high\u2010speed streams follow the same slow drop in speed with decreasing latitude observed in the large polar coronal holes around solar minimum. These results suggest a solar wind acceleration effect that is related to heliolatitude or solar rotation. We also find that the solar wind dynamic pressure is significantly lower in the post\u2010maximum phase of this solar cycle than during the previous one, indicating that while the heliosphere is larger than near solar minimum, it should be smaller than during or after the previous \u2026",

Here, we provide combined consensus values for this velocity vector and show that they have important implications for the global interstellar interaction.
