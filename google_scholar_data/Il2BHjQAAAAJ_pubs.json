            "Introduction. Neonatal sepsis is a disease process, which represents the systemic response of bacteria entering the bloodstream during the first 28 days of life. The prevalence of sepsis is higher in male infants than in females, but the exact cause is unknown. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which leads to the production of NADPH. NADPH is required for the respiratory burst reaction in white blood cells (WBCs) to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis.Materials and methods. This study was performed on 76 neonates with sepsis and 1214 normal neonates from February 2012 to November 2014 in the west of Iran. The G6PD deficiency status was determined by fluorescent spot test. WBCs number and neutrophils percentages were measured and compared in \u2026",

The frequency of eNOS 4a\/b genotypes between T2DM and controls was not significantly difference. Studying eNOS 4a\/b variants alone indicated that the presence of eNOS 4a allele was not associated with the risk of developing DN. However, considering both polymorphisms of eNOS 4a\/b and G894T indicated that the risk of macroalbuminuria significantly increased in the presence of either eNOS 4a or 894T allele by 2.45 times (p= 0.014) and 3.7-fold (p= 0.016), respectively.

Human mutations in NR5A1were initially found in two 46, XY female patients suffering from severe gonadal dysgenesis and primary adrenal failure. However, more recent case reports have suggested that heterozygous mutations in NR5A1 may also contribute to the male infertility aetiology. We have analysed the coding sequence of NR5A1 in a cohort of 90 well\u2010characterised idiopathic Iranian azoospermic infertile men versus 112 fertile men. Heterozygous NR5A1 mutations were found in 2 of 90 (2.2%) of cases.

Hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders characterized by increased secretion of thyroid hormones T3 and\/or T4. This study investigated frequency of abnormal liver function tests in the patients with hyperthyroidism that referred to Imam Reza Hospital of Kermanshah from 1 st October 2009 to 30 th April 2012. Patients who had complication disorders such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, liver disease and using any of drugs effecting liver and thyroid function tests and patients with positive hepatic viral markers were excluded from the study. After excluding patients with complication disorders, fifty patients were remained. Fifty volunteers without history of significant diseases were chosen as matched control group. Mean ALT (Alanine amino transferase) of cases were 52.1\u00b16.97 and of controls were 25.6\u00b13.9. Also, Mean ALP (Alkaline phosphatase) of cases was 259.94\u00b125.83 and of controls were 185.10\u00b133.75. There is significant difference between ALT, ALP in case group in compare the control group (P< 0.05 and P< 0.01 respectively). Further, there is no significant difference in serum levels of AST (Aspartate amino transferase) and Mean direct bilirubin between case and control group. These findings indicate that ALT and ALP levels are frequently elevated in hyperthyroidism. Hence, they are possibly thyroid dependent enzymes.",

G6PD plays a key role in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is a major source of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH provides the reducing equivalents for oxidation-reduction reductions involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species such as H 2 O 2. We hypothesized that G6PD deficiency may reduce the amount of NADPH in sperms, thereby inhibiting the detoxification of H 2 O 2, which could potentially affect their motility and viability, resulting in an increased susceptibility to infertility.MethodsSemen samples were obtained from four males with G6PD deficiency and eight healthy males as a control.
