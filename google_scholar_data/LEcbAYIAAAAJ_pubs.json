We show that this theory has strong interactions at a length scale \u03bb 3~(\u03bb DGP 2\/M P) 1\/3. If \u03bb DGP is of order the Hubble length, then the theory loses predictivity at distances shorter than \u03bb 3~ 1000 km. The strong interaction can be viewed as arising from a longitudinaleaten Goldstone'mode that gets a small kinetic term only from mixing with transverse graviton polarizations, analogous to the case of massive gravity. We also present a negative-energy classical solution, which can be avoided by cutting off the theory at the same scale scale \u03bb 3. Finally, we examine the dynamics of the longitudinal Goldstone mode when the background geometry is curved.",

There is no normalizable zero-mode graviton in this case, nevertheless correct Newton's law can be obtained by exchanging bulk gravitons. This can be interpreted as an exchange of a single metastable 4D graviton. Such theories have remarkable phenomenological signatures since the evolution of the Universe becomes high-dimensional at very large scales. Furthermore, the bulk supersymmetry in the infinite volume limit might be preserved while being completely broken on a brane. This gives rise to a possibility of controlling the value of the bulk cosmological constant. Unfortunately, these theories have difficulties in reproducing certain predictions of Einstein's theory related to relativistic sources. This is due to the van Dam\u2013Veltman\u2013Zakharov \u2026",

            "We present a superconformal master action for a class of supergravity models with one arbitrary function defining the Jordan frame. It leads to a gauge-invariant action for a real vector multiplet, which upon gauge fixing describes a massive vector multiplet, or to a dual formulation with a linear multiplet and a massive tensor field. In both cases the models have one real scalar, the inflaton, naturally suited for single-field inflation. Vectors and tensors required by supersymmetry to complement a single real scalar do not acquire vacuum expectation values during inflation, so there is no need to stabilize the extra scalars that are always present in the theories with chiral matter multiplets. The new class of models can describe any inflaton potential that vanishes at its minimum and grows monotonically away from the minimum. In this class of supergravity models, one can fit any desirable choice of inflationary parameters n s \u2026",
