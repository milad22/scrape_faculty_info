            "The self-assembly of colloids is an alternative to top-down processing that enables the fabrication of nanostructures. We show that self-assembled clusters of metal-dielectric spheres are the basis for nanophotonic structures. By tailoring the number and position of spheres in close-packed clusters, plasmon modes exhibiting strong magnetic and Fano-like resonances emerge. The use of identical spheres simplifies cluster assembly and facilitates the fabrication of highly symmetric structures. Dielectric spacers are used to tailor the interparticle spacing in these clusters to be approximately 2 nanometers. These types of chemically synthesized nanoparticle clusters can be generalized to other two- and three-dimensional structures and can serve as building blocks for new metamaterials.",

As a result, complex or low-coordination structures, common in atomic and molecular systems, are rare in the colloidal domain. Here we demonstrate a general method for creating the colloidal analogues of atoms with valence: colloidal particles with chemically distinct surface patches that imitate hybridized atomic orbitals, including sp, sp 2, sp 3, sp 3 d, sp 3 d 2 and sp 3 d 3. Functionalized with DNA with single-stranded sticky ends, patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA hybridization.

Whereas natural colloids are the stuff of paint, milk, and glue, synthetic colloids with well-controlled size distributions and interactions are a model system for understanding phase transitions. These colloids can form crystals and other phases of matter seen in atomic and molecular systems, but because the particles are large enough to be seen under an optical microscope, the microscopic mechanisms of phase transitions can be directly observed. Furthermore, their ability to spontaneously form phases that are ordered on the scale of visible wavelengths makes colloids useful building blocks for optical materials such as photonic crystals.

However, little is known about the dynamics of binding. Here we show that the adsorption of polystyrene microspheres to a water\/oil interface is characterized by a sudden breach and an unexpectedly slow relaxation. The relaxation appears logarithmic in time, indicating that complete equilibration may take months. Surprisingly, viscous dissipation appears to play little role. Instead, the observed dynamics, which bear strong resemblance to ageing in glassy systems, agree well with a model describing activated \u2026",
