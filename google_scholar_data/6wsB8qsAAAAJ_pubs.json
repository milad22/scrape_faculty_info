The BBN models represent the ecological causal web of key environmental correlates (KECs) that most influence habitat capability, potential population response for each species, and influence of habitat planning alternatives. BBN models represent site-specific KECs, habitat capability at the subwatershed level, and pattern of habitat capability across all subwatersheds. BBNs use Dirichlet prior probability distributions and standard Bayesian updating of posterior probabilities. We derived estimates of prior and conditional probabilities from a mix of empirical data and expert judgment, mostly the latter. Sensitivity analyses identified planning decisions and KECs that most influence species outcomes, and can help prioritize monitoring activities. BBN models \u2026",

We identify areas where management applications using elasticity analysis potentially conflict with the mathematical basis of the technique, and we use a hypothetical example and three real data sets (Prairie Chicken [\u2003\u2003Tympanuchus cupido], desert tortoise [Gopherus agassizii], and killer whale [Orcinus orca]) to evaluate the extent to which conservation recommendations based on elasticities might be misleading. First, changes in one demographic rate can change the qualitative ranking of the elasticity values calculated from a population matrix, a result that dampens enthusiasm for ranking conservation actions based solely on which rates have the highest elasticity values.

First, we tested the hypothesis that elk selection of habitats increases with increasing distance away from open roads. This forms the empirical basis for the model. Second, we compared the model's predictions of relative elk habitat selection, or habitat effectiveness (HE), with observed values at varying levels of road density. And third, we examined the potentially confounding effects of different spatial patterns of roads on model predictions. We conducted our study during spring and summer, 1993-95, at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey), northeast Oregon. Selection ratios were calculated using >100,000 recorded locations of 89 radiocollared female elk, with locations mapped in relation to 0.1-km-wide \u2026",

Results presumably allow recovery efforts to focus on the life stage most responsible for change in population growth, as indexed by the highest elasticity. Specifically, the highest elasticity denotes the vital rate whose proportionate change exerts the largest proportionate effect on the finite rate of increase (\u03bb). We examined the utility of this analysis given uncertainty in parameter estimates and random variation in vital rates. We modeled these conditions to test the hypothesis that nest success and brood survival exert the greatest effect on population growth of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus). We calculated elasticity associated with each age-specific vital rate contained in 1,000 randomly-generated replicates of a Leslie matrix \u2026",

Disturbance to native plant communities, whether natural or management induced, is a primary factor contributing to successful invasion by exotic plant species. Herbivory by both wild and domestic ungulates exerts considerable impact on structure and composition of native plant communities. Intensive herbivory by ungulates can enhance exotic plant invasion, establishment, and spread for three reasons: (1) many exotic plants are adapted to ground disturbances such as those caused by ungulate feeding, trampling, and movements; (2) many exotic plants are adapted for easy transport from one area to another by ungulates via endozoochory and epizoochory; (3) many exotic plants are not palatable or are of low palatability to ungulates, and consequently, their survival is favored as ungulates reduce or eliminate palatable \u2026",

            "A major assumption of our work was that validation research will be conducted by agency scientists and other researchers to corroborate our findings. As a preliminary step in the process of validation, we found high agreement between trends in source habitats and prior trends in habitat outcomes that were estimated as part of the habitat outcome analysis for terrestrial species within the basin. Results of our assessment also were assumed to lead to finer scale evaluations of habitats for some species, groups, or families as part of implementation procedures. Implementation procedures are necessary to relate our findings to local conditions; this would enable managers to effectively apply local conservation and restoration practices to support broadscale conservation and restoration strategies that may evolve from our findings.",

            "Widespread degradation of the sagebrush ecosystem in the western United States, including the invasion of cheatgrass, has prompted resource managers to consider a variety of approaches to restore and conserve habitats for sagebrush-associated species. One such approach involves the use of greater sage-grouse, a species of prominent conservation interest, as an umbrella species. This shortcut approach assumes that managing habitats to conserve sage-grouse will simultaneously benefit other species of conservation concern. The efficacy of using sage-grouse as an umbrella species for conservation management, however, has not been fully evaluated. We tested that concept by comparing:(1) commonality in land-cover associations, and (2) spatial overlap in habitats between sage-grouse and 39 other sagebrush-associated vertebrate species of conservation concern in the Great Basin ecoregion \u2026",
