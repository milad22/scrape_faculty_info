            "In this paper, a new neural network (NN) for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery which synthesises the theory of adaptive resonance theory (ART) and the learning strategy of Kohonen neural network (KNN), is proposed. For NNs, as the new case occurs, the corresponding data should be added to their dataset for learning. However, the \u2018off-line\u2019 NNs are unable to adapt autonomously and must be retrained by applying the complete dataset including the new data. The ART networks can solve the plasticity\u2013stability dilemma. In other words, they are able to carry out \u2018on-line\u2019 training without forgetting previously trained patterns (stable training); it can recode previously trained categories adaptive to changes in the environment and is self-organising. ART\u2013KNN also holds these characteristics, and more suitable than original ART for fault diagnosis of machinery. In order to test the proposed network, the vibration signal \u2026",

            "It has been shown that the heparin\u2010degrading endosulfatase, sulfatase 1 (SULF1), functions as a liver tumor suppressor, but the role of the related sulfatase, sulfatase 2 (SULF2), in liver carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of SULF2 on liver tumorigenesis. Expression of SULF2 was increased in 79 (57%) of 139 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 8 (73%) of 11 HCC cell lines. Forced expression of SULF2 increased HCC cell growth and migration, whereas knockdown of SULF2 using short hairpin RNA targeting SULF2 abrogated HCC cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Because SULF1 and SULF2 desulfate heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the HSPG glypican 3 (GPC3) is up\u2010regulated in HCC, we investigated the effects of SULF2 on GPC3 expression and the association of SULF2 with GPC3.

            "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as a new type of nanoporous materials with tailorable structures and functions. Usually, MOFs have uniform pores smaller than 2 nm in size, limiting their practical applications in some cases. Although a few approaches have been adopted to prepare MOFs with larger pores, it is still challenging to synthesize hierarchical-pore MOFs (H-MOFs) with high structural controllability and good stability. Here we demonstrate a facile and versatile method, an in situ self-assembly template strategy for fabricating stable H-MOFs, in which multi-scale soluble and\/or acid-sensitive metal-organic assembly (MOA) fragments form during the reactions between metal ions and organic ligands (to construct MOFs), and act as removable dynamic chemical templates. This general strategy was successfully used to prepare various H-MOFs that show rich porous properties and \u2026",

Developing a valid PPTT that induces cancer cell apoptosis and avoids necrosis in vivo and exploring its molecular mechanism of action is of great importance. Furthermore, assessment of the long-term fate of the AuNRs after treatment is critical for clinical use. We first optimized the size, surface modification [rifampicin (RF) conjugation], and concentration (2.5 nM) of AuNRs and the PPTT laser power (2 W\/cm2) to achieve maximal induction of apoptosis. Second, we studied the potential mechanism of action of AuNRs-PPTT using quantitative proteomic analysis in mouse tumor tissues.

While most existing works rely on the abundance of labeled training data, we consider a more difficult zero-shot setting where no training data is supplied. We first pre-train a number of concept classifiers using data from other sources. Then we evaluate the semantic correlation of each concept wrt the event of interest. After further refinement to take prediction inaccuracy and discriminative power into account, we apply the discovered concept classifiers on all test videos and obtain multiple score vectors. These distinct score vectors are converted into pairwise comparison matrices and the nuclear norm rank aggregation framework is adopted to seek consensus. To address the challenging optimization formulation, we propose an efficient, highly scalable algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster than existing alternatives. Experiments on recent TRECVID datasets verify the superiority of the proposed approach.",

            "Numerous viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV) induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which interrupts protein folding causing accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in ER. To alleviate the stress placed on ER, these proteins must be refolded or degraded by activating a specific cellular response known as ER stress response or unfolded protein response (UPR). Two UPR-specific signaling pathways involving transmembrane proteins ATF6 and XBP1 generate critical transcription factors that activate UPR-responsive genes. In this study, the role of the multifunctional regulatory protein of HBV (HBx protein) in activation of UPR was investigated. In Hep3B cells with transit or stable expression of HBx, XBP1 expression and ATF6 cleavage was observed, suggesting that the ATF6 and IRE1-XBP1 pathways were activated.
