            "We present a phase-imaging technique to quantitatively study the three-dimensional structure of cells. The method, based on the simultaneous dual-wavelength digital holography, allows for higher axial range at which the unambiguous phase imaging can be performed. The technique is capable of nanometer axial resolution. The noise level, which increases as a result of using two wavelengths, is then reduced to the level of a single wavelength. The method compares favorably to software unwrapping, as the technique does not produce non-existent phase steps. Curvature mismatch between the reference and object beams is numerically compensated. The 3D images of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells are presented.",

            "Cellular volume changes play important roles in many processes associated with the normal cell activity, as well as various diseases. Consequently, there is a considerable need to accurately measure volumes of both individual cells and cell populations as a function of time. In this study, we have monitored cell volume changes in real time during apoptosis using digital holographic microscopy. Cell volume changes were deduced from the measured phase change of light transmitted through cells. Our digital holographic experiments showed that after exposure to 1 \u03bcM staurosporine for 4 h, the volumes of KB cells were reduced by \u223c50\u201360%, which is consistent with previous results obtained using electronic cell sizing and atomic force microscopy. In comparison with other techniques, digital holographic microscopy is advantageous because it employs noninvasive detection, has high time resolution, real time \u2026",

Phase imaging of objects with optical height variation greater than the wavelength of light is ambiguous and causes phase wrapping. By comparing two phase images recorded at different wavelengths, the images can be accurately unwrapped. The unwrapping method is computationally fast and straightforward, and it can process complex topologies. Additionally, the limitations on the total optical height are significantly relaxed. This new methodology is widely applicable to other phase-imaging techniques as well as in applications beyond optical microscopy.",

During a 2-week production period, ex vivo produced oral mucosa-equivalent constructs (EVPOMEs) may encounter adverse culturing conditions that might compromise their quality and render them ineffective. We demonstrate the application of near-infrared Raman spectroscopy to in vitro monitoring of EVPOMEs during their manufacturing process, with the ultimate goal of applying this technology in situ to monitor the grafted EVPOMEs. We identify Raman spectroscopic failure indicators for less-than optimal EVPOMEs that are stressed by higher temperature and exposure to higher than normal concentration of calcium ions.
