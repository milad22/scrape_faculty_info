            "The many-body formalism for dynamical mean-field theory is extended to treat nonequilibrium problems. We illustrate how the formalism works by examining the transient decay of the oscillating current that is driven by a large electric field turned on at time t= 0. We show how the Bloch oscillations are quenched by the electron-electron interactions, and how their character changes dramatically for a Mott insulator.",
