            "This paper presents a scalable method of preparing highly monodisperse core\u2013shell particles and hollow spheres, and their application in fabricating colloidal crystals. By using polystyrene (PS) particles as the template and vinyltrimethoxysilane as the precursor, the core\u2013shell particles could be obtained via direct growth of vinyl-SiO2 hybrid material on the negatively charged PS template. This method has two interesting characteristics. The first is the tunable shell thickness (from 10 to 170 nm) combined with a low polydispersity (smaller than 3%). Second, the method is simpler than traditional ones, which use surface modified PS as template to get a uniform coating. Furthermore, the core\u2013shell particles could be converted into hollow SiO2 spheres by removing the PS cores in a calcination process. Both the PS@vinyl-SiO2 particles and the hollow SiO2 spheres could be self-assembled into three-dimensional \u2026",

One process, one precursor (organosilane) and one solvent (water) were used in our experiments. The size of hybrid silica spheres could be adjusted from 360 to 770 nm with relative standard deviation below 2% by controlling the concentration of the organosilane precursor and the ammonia catalyst. The increasing of the precursor concentration increases the particle size while the catalyst concentration has a reverse effect on the particle size. The concept of homogeneous nucleation and growth processes are introduced to explain the formation mechanism and the effect of reaction conditions.

Changes in the particle shape were analyzed by electron microscopy and associated changes in the plasmon resonance by electron energy loss spectroscopy. Silica-coated rods were found to be more stable compared to uncoated rods but could still be deformed via an intermediate bullet-like shape for silica shell thicknesses of 14 nm. Changes in the size ratio of the rods after fs-illumination resulted in blue-shifting of the longitudinal plasmon resonances. Two-dimensional spatial mapping of the plasmon resonances revealed that the flat side of the bullet-like particles showed a less pronounced longitudinal plasmonic electric field enhancement. These findings were confirmed by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Furthermore, at higher laser fluences size reduction of the \u2026",

However, 3D tracking of anisotropic particles in concentrated phases remains not as optimized compared to algorithms for spherical particles. To address this problem, we developed a new particle-fitting algorithm that can extract the positions and orientations of fluorescent rod-like particles from three dimensional confocal microscopy data stacks. The algorithm is tailored to work even when the fluorescent signals of the particles overlap considerably and a threshold method and subsequent clusters analysis alone do not suffice. We demonstrate that our algorithm correctly identifies all five coordinates of uniaxial particles in both a concentrated disordered phase and a liquid-crystalline smectic-B phase.

Flat band slow light property is observed, which provides low group velocity dispersion and avoids high speed optics signal from distortion in transmission. A method is proposed by tuning the positions of the first and second rows with the ring-shape-holes adjacent to the slot, which can tune the group index and the bandwidth of the guided band at the same time. This method is used to optimize the slow light property of the RSPhCW. The bandwidths ranging from 1.8 nm to 17.3 nm for group indices from 15 to 67 are obtained.
