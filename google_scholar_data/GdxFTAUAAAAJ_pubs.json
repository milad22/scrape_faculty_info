When this homeostasis is perturbed, the formation of self-reactive antibodies can have serious pathological consequences. B cells expressing an antigen receptor specific for self-immunoglobulin-\u03b3 (IgG) make a class of autoantibodies known as rheumatoid factor (RF). Here we show that effective activation of RF+ B cells is mediated by IgG2a\u2013chromatin immune complexes and requires the synergistic engagement of the antigen receptor and a member of the MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) family.

The mechanism by which allogeneic T cells are initially stimulated is unknown. In a murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation model it was found that, despite the presence of numerous donor antigen-presenting cells, only host-derived antigen-presenting cells initiated graft versus host disease. Thus, strategies for preventing graft versus host disease could be developed that are based on inactivating host antigen-presenting cells. Such strategies could expand the safety and application of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in treatment of common genetic and neoplastic diseases.",

We showed previously that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, recognizing DNA, is required for the spontaneous generation of DNA autoantibodies, but not for the development of lupus nephritis in susceptible mice. We report that lupus-prone mice deficient in TLR7, a receptor for ssRNA, failed to generate Abs to RNA-containing antigens (Ags) such as Smith (Sm) Ag. TLR9 and TLR7 also had dramatic effects on clinical disease in lupus-prone mice. In the absence of TLR9, autoimmune disease was exacerbated, lymphocytes and plasmacytoid DCs were more activated, and serum IgG and IFN-\u03b1 were increased. In contrast, TLR7-deficient mice had ameliorated disease, decreased lymphocyte activation, and decreased serum IgG. These findings reveal opposing inflammatory and regulatory roles for TLR7 \u2026",

We demonstrate that this two-receptor paradigm can be extended to the BCR\/TLR7 activation of autoreactive B cells by RNA and RNA-associated autoantigens. These data implicate TLR recognition of endogenous ligands in the response to both DNA- and RNA-associated autoantigens.

            "Polyclonal activation has been proposed as the reason that auto-antibodies are produced during autoimmune disease 1\u20133. This model denies a role for specific antigen selection of B cells and predicts instead a multiclonal population of unmutated or randomly mutated autoantibodies. We have found that the genetic features and clonal composition of spontaneously derived immunoglobulin G (IgG) antiself-IgG (rheumatoid factor (RF)) autoantibodies derived from the autoimmune MRL\/lpr mouse strain are inconsistent with both the predictions of this model and the actual outcome of experimental polyclonal activation 4, 5. Instead we have found that MRL\/lpr RFs are oligoclonal or even monoclonal in origin. They harbour numerous somatic mutations which are distributed in a way that suggests immunoglobulin-receptor-depen-dent selection of these mutations. In this sense, the MRL\/lpr RFs resemble antibodies \u2026",

            "The proximate cause of autoantibodies characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases has been controversial. One hypothesis is that autoantibodies are the result of polyclonal nonspecific B cell activation. Alternatively, autoantibodies could be the result of antigen-driven B cell activation, as observed in secondary immune responses. We have approached this question by studying monoclonal anti-DNA autoantibodies derived from unmanipulated spleen cells of the autoimmune MRL\/lpr mouse strain. This analysis shows that anti-DNAs, like rheumatoid factors (19), are the result of specific antigen-driven stimulation. In addition, correlation of sequences with fine specificity shows that: (a) somatic mutations can cause specificity for dsDNA and that such mutations are selected for; (b) arginine residues play an important role in determining specificity; and (c) anti-idiotypes that recognize the majority of anti-DNA are \u2026",
