Total DNA was extracted from the intestine of Chinese shrimp. Then population fingerprints of the predominant microbiota were generated by DGGE analysis of universal V3 16S rDNA PCR amplicons, and 22 distinct bands from DGGE were sequenced. In addition, bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with universal bacterial primers 27F and 1387R. Amplicons were ligated into cloning vectors and near-full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts were analyzed. A clone library was constructed and 72 clones were sequenced. The results \u2026",

            "1,3-Butadiene, classified as hazardous in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, is an important ambient air pollutant. Understanding its atmospheric transformation is useful for its own sake, and is also helpful for eliciting isoprene's fate in the atmosphere (isoprene dominates the biogenic emissions in US). In this paper, samples from both hydroxyl- and ozone-initiated photooxidation of 1,3-butadiene were analyzed by derivatization with O- (2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine followed by separation and detection by gas chromatography\/ion trap mass spectrometry to detect and identify carbonyl compounds. The following carbonyls were observed: formaldehyde, acrolein, glycolaldehyde, glycidaldehyde, 3-hydroxy-propanaldehyde, hydroxy acetone, and malonaldehyde, which can be classified into three categories: epoxy carbonyls, hydroxyl carbonyls, and di-carbonyls.

A constitutive model was constructed based on the Gaussian-distributed morphology of crimped collagen fibrils. The parameters that represent the micro characteristics of collagen fibrils were determined by fitting the experimental data to the constitutive model. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to visualize the crimping morphology of collagen fibrils in the stroma. A quantitative analysis of fibril crimping degrees in the TEM images was conducted to test the parameters predicted by the constitutive model.Results.: The parameters were derived using a fitting method that included the expectation for the distribution of fibril crimping degrees, \u03bc= 1.063; the standard deviation, \u03c3= 0.0781; the elastic modulus of collagen fibrils, E= 52.74 MPa; and the fibril ultimate strain, \u03b5 b= 0.1957. TEM images showed a variation of the fibril crimping morphology when the cornea was subjected to different tensile loads. A good agreement was found between the parameters derived by the constitutive model and the data quantified from the TEM images.Conclusions.: The nonlinear mechanical behavior of the cornea is closely correlated with the crimping morphology of collagen fibrils. The findings are expected to guide further research of corneal pathologies related to the abnormal microstructure of collagen fibrils.",
