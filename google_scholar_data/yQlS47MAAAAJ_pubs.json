            "First-generation semiconductors could not be properly termed\" doped-they were simply very impure. Uncontrolled impurities hindered the discovery of physical laws, baffling researchers and evoking pessimism and derision in advocates of the burgeoning\" pure\" physical disciplines. The eventual banish ment of the\" dirt\" heralded a new era in semiconductor physics, an era that had\" purity\" as its motto. It was this era that yielded the successes of the 1950s and brought about a new technology of\" semiconductor electronics\". Experiments with pure crystals provided a powerful stimulus to the develop ment of semiconductor theory. New methods and theories were developed and tested: the effective-mass method for complex bands, the theory of impurity states, and the theory of kinetic phenomena. These developments constitute what is now known as semiconductor phys ics. In the last fifteen years, however, there has been a noticeable shift towards impure semiconductors-a shift which came about because it is precisely the impurities that are essential to a number of major semiconductor devices. Technology needs impure semiconductors, which unlike the first-generation items, are termed\" doped\" rather than\" impure\" to indicate that the impurity levels can now be controlled to a certain extent.",

The self-consistent electrostatic potential in the region occupied by 2DEG changes in a steplike manner due to the formation of alternating strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquids. We obtain the dependence of positions and widths of these strips on the filling factor. Incompressible strips are shown to be much more narrow than the compressible ones. The relationship between the widths of the adjacent compressible and incompressible strips is found to be universal: It does not depend on the strip number, magnetic field, or gate voltage. Our theory enables us to explain results obtained in experimental studies of edge-state equilibration.",

In these systems, many phenomena go beyond the framework of mean-field theories, whether linear Debye-H\u00fcckel or nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann, culminating in charge inversion\u2014a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a strongly charged particle, called a macroion, binds so many counterions that its net charge changes sign. The review discusses the universal theory of charge inversion based on the idea of a strongly correlated liquid of adsorbed counterions, similar to a Wigner crystal. This theory has a vast array of applications, particularly in biology and chemistry; for example, in the presence of positive multivalent ions (eg, polycations), the DNA double helix acquires a net positive charge and drifts as a positive particle in an electric field.

We claim that in the limit of an infinite system there are only three possible functions P (s): Wigner surmise P W (s) in a metal, Poisson law P P (s) in an insulator, and a third one P T (s), exactly at the transition. The function P T is an interesting hybrid of P W (s) and P P (s), it has the small-s behavior of the former and the large-s behavior of the latter one. A scaling theory of critical behavior of P (s) in finite samples is proposed and verified numerically.",

It is shown that the electrons at the upper Landau level form domains with filling factors equal to 1 and zero. The domains alternate with a spatial period of order of the cyclotron radius, which is much larger than the interparticle distance at the upper Landau level. The one-particle density of states, which can be probed by tunneling experiments, is shown to have a gap linearly dependent on the magnetic field in the limit of large N.",
