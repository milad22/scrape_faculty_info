Different spectral weights of the partial superconducting density of states are a reflection of different tunneling directions in this multiband system. Temperature evolution of the tunneling spectra follows the BCS scenario [Phys. Rev. Lett. 3, 552 (1959)] with both gaps vanishing at the bulk T c.

A reproducible dip feature in the tunneling conductance is found near| eV|= 2 \u0394, observed for both voltage polarities in the best resolved spectra. With overdoping the position of the dip continues to scale with \u0394, and its magnitude decreases as \u0394 decreases. These results indicate that the dip feature arises from a strong-coupling effect whereby the quasiparticle lifetime is decreased at a characteristic energy of\u223c 2 \u0394, consistent with an electron-electron pairing interaction.",

The vortex configuration states are strongly dependent on the number of flux quanta and the nanoscale confinement architecture of the mesoscopic superconductor.

Here we investigate, using photoemission, X-ray scattering and scanning tunnelling microscopy, the canonical CDW compound 2H-NbSe 2 intercalated with Mn and Co, and show that the conventional view is untenable. We find that, either at high temperature or at large intercalation, CDW order becomes short-ranged with a well-defined amplitude, which has impacts on the electronic dispersion, giving rise to an energy gap. The phase transition at T cdw marks the onset of long-range order with global phase coherence, leading to sharp electronic excitations. Our observations emphasize the \u2026",

            "Using scanning tunneling microscopy and Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we explore vortex configurations in magnetically coupled NbSe 2\/permalloy superconductor\/ferromagnet bilayer. The permalloy film with stripe domain structure induces periodic local magnetic induction in the superconductor, creating a series of pinning-antipinning channels for externally added magnetic flux quanta. Such laterally confined Abrikosov vortices form quasi-one-dimensional arrays (chains). The transitions between multichain states occur through propagation of kinks at the intermediate fields. At high fields we show that the system becomes nonlinear due to a change in both the number of vortices and the confining potential. The longitudinal instabilities of the resulting vortex structures lead to vortices \u201clevitating\u201d in the antipinning channels.",
