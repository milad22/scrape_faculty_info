            "The utilization of plant oil renewable resources as raw materials for monomers and polymers is discussed and reviewed. In an age of increasing oil prices, global warming and other environmental problems (e.g. waste) the change from fossil feedstock to renewable resources can considerably contribute to a sustainable development in the future. Especially plant derived fats and oils bear a large potential for the substitution of currently used petrochemicals, since monomers, fine chemicals and polymers can be derived from these resources in a straightforward fashion. The synthesis of monomers as well as polymers from plant fats and oils has already found some industrial application and recent developments in this field offer promising new opportunities, as is shown within this contribution.

A tremendous geographical and feedstock shift of oleochemical production has taken place from North America and Europe to southeast Asia and from tallow to palm oil. It will be important to introduce and to cultivate more and new oil plants containing fatty acids with interesting and desired properties for chemical utilization while simultaneously increasing the agricultural biodiversity. The problem of the industrial utilization of food plant oils has become more urgent with the development of the global biodiesel production. The remarkable advances made during the last decade in organic synthesis, catalysis, and biotechnology using plant oils and the basic oleochemicals derived from them will be reported, including, for example, \u03c9\u2010functionalization of fatty acids \u2026",

Although many different synthetic approaches have been used, more recent examples are pointing in the direction of catalytic transformations and other efficient reactions to achieve a more sustainable production of polymers from these renewable resources. In this context, olefin metathesis, thiol\u2013ene additions, and other processes can contribute not only to a more efficient synthesis of plant oil based polymers, but also to broaden the application possibilities of plant oils.

Upon enhancing the reaction rates by factors of up to 400 in the range from 80 to 200 \u00b0C, the first-order kinetics of the monomer consumption and the livingness of the polymerization were maintained. As a consequence of the fast, direct, and noncontact heating by the microwave irradiation, the polymerizations could be carried out in highly concentrated solutions or even from bulk conditions, yielding well-defined polymers (PDI < 1.20). Under the conditions applied in this study, a maximum number of 300 monomers (100 in the case of 2-methyl- and 2-nonyl-2-oxazoline) could be incorporated into the polymer chains under the premise that the average molecular weight distributions remained narrow (PDI < 1 \u2026",

Two different approaches were studied and compared to each other. First, monomers were synthesized by the Passerini-3CR and then polymerized via acyclic diene metathesis. Alternatively, bifunctional monomers were synthesized by self-metathesis and then polymerized by Passerini-3CR. Both approaches led to the formation of high-molecular-weight polymers. Moreover, Passerini-3CRs were shown to be a versatile grafting-onto method. The results clearly demonstrate that the Passerini-3CR offers an interesting new access to monomers and polymers and thus broadens the synthetic portfolio of polymer science.",
