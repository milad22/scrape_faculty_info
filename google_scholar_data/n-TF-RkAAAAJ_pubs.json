In general, the cross section d \u03c3\/d Q 2 d y d \u03a9 is determined by nine structure functions, and several interesting correlations between the polarization direction and the observed cross section are possible. In the Drell-Yan parton model for the process, the structure of the cross section is much simpler: there are six linear relations among the structure functions. An experimental test of these relations would provide a stringent test of the Drell-Yan model.",

Although this distribution is straightforward to define in the QCD-improved parton model and represents a fundamental quark degree of freedom, it has never been measured. Moreover, deeply inelastic electroproduction experiments are only sensitive to this distribution at the higher twist level, and then mix this contribution with others, including the one coming from multiparton initial states. Reviewing this, we conclude that the Drell-Yan process is the best way to measure the quark transverse spin polarization distribution.",

An enlarged data set and a more detailed study of hadronic showers results in a sensitivity improvement of more than 1 order of magnitude compared to our previously published results.

            "Cosmic ray events above 1020 eV are on the verge of confronting fundamental particle physics. The neutrino is the only candidate primary among established particles capable of crossing 100 Mpc intergalactic distances unimpeded. The magnitude of \u03bdN cross sections indicated by events, plus consistency with the Standard Model at low-energy, point to new physics of massive spin-2 exchange. In models based on extra dimensions, we find that the \u03bdN cross section rises to typical hadronic values of between 1 and 100 mb at energies above 1020 eV. Our calculations take into account constraints of unitarity. We conclude that air-showers observed with energies above 1019 eV are consistent with neutrino primaries and extra-dimension models. An upper bound of 1\u201310 TeV on the mass scale at which graviton exchange becomes strong in current Kaluza\u2013Klein models follows.",

            "Color transparency is the proposal that under certain circumstances the strong interactions can be controlled and in some cases reduced in magnitude. We give a comprehensive review of the physics, which hinges on the interface of perturbative QCD with non-perturbative strong interactions. Color transparency is expected to occur in many kinds of quasi-exclusive reactions with either electron or hadron beams. We review the interplay of color transparency with nuclear filtering, which is the conversion of quark wave functions in hadrons to smaller transverse space dimensions by interaction with a nuclear medium. A complete description of these phenomena as a multi-scale QCD process is given in terms of light-cone matrix elements. We also review a number of other approaches, including pictures based on modeling the time evolution of hadronic wave packets and the use of hadronic interpolating states. Spin \u2026",
