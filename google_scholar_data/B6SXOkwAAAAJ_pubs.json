            "Achieving the control of light fields in a manner similar in sophistication to the control of electromagnetic fields in the microwave and radiofrequency regimes has been a major challenge in optical physics research. We manipulated the phase and amplitude of five discrete harmonics spanning the blue to mid-infrared frequencies to produce instantaneous optical fields in the shape of square, sawtooth, and subcycle sine and cosine pulses at a repetition rate of 125 terahertz. Furthermore, we developed an all-optical shaper-assisted linear cross-correlation technique to retrieve these fields and thereby verified their shapes and confirmed the critical role of carrier-envelope phase in Fourier synthesis of optical waveforms.",

            "Mechanically triturated n- and p-type Bi2Te3 nanoparticles, the nanoscale topological insulators (TIs), are employed as nonlinear saturable absorbers to passively mode-lock the erbium-doped fiber lasers (EDFLs) for sub-400 fs pulse generations. A novel method is proposed to enable the control on the self-amplitude modulation (SAM) of TI by adjusting its dopant type. The dopant type of TI only shifts the Fermi level without changing its energy bandgap, that the n- and p-type Bi2Te3 nanoparticles have shown the broadband saturable absorption at 800 and 1570 nm. In addition, both the complicated pulse shortening procedure and the competition between hybrid mode-locking mechanisms in the Bi2Te3 nanoparticle mode-locked EDFL system have been elucidated. The p-type Bi2Te3 with its lower effective Fermi level results in more capacity for excited carriers than the n-type Bi2Te3, which shortens the pulse \u2026",

We verify by optical correlation that the carrier-envelope phase is constant in these waveforms when they are synthesized from commensurate sidebands. The estimated overall shift of the carrier-envelope phase is less than 0.18 cycles from the first to the last pulse of nearly 10 6 pulses in the pulse train.",

The measured modulation depth was from 1 to 4.5% as the thickness increased 18 to 265 \u03bcm. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the stable mode-locked EDFL (MLEDFL) pulse decreased from 3.43 to 2.02 ps as the concentrations of SWCNTs SA increased 0.125 to 0.5 wt%. At constant concentration of 0.125 wt%, the similar pulse shortening effect of the MLEDFL was also observed when the FWHM decreased from 3.43 to 1.85 ps as the thickness of SWCNTs SA increased 8 to 100 \u03bcm. With an erbium-doped fiber length of 80 cm, the shortest pulse width of 1.85 ps were achieved at 1.56\u03bcm with a \u2026",
