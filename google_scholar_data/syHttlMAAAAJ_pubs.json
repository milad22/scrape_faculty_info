            "Many researchers, especially those new to the field, need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy, either for the purposes of their own research, or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review. 1 Acceptable standards are an important issue, particularly considering that each of us may have his\/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately, the answer is in part a \u201cmoving target\u201d as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria, only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas. Conversely, as a reviewer, it is tiresome to raise the same objections repeatedly, wondering why researchers have not fulfilled some of the basic requirements for establishing the occurrence of an autophagic process.

Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. 2, 3 There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes.

This Lewy pathology appears to spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Furthermore, recent studies showed the occurrence of Lewy pathology in neurons grafted into the brains of PD patients, suggesting the spread of pathology from the host tissues to the grafts. The mechanism underlying this propagation is unknown. Here, we show that \u03b1-synuclein is transmitted via endocytosis to neighboring neurons and neuronal precursor cells, forming Lewy-like inclusions. Moreover, \u03b1-synuclein was transmitted from the affected neurons to engrafted neuronal precursor cells in a transgenic model of PD-like pathology.

However, the normal biology of \u03b1-syn and how it relates to the aggregation of the protein are not clearly understood. Because of the lack of the signal sequence and its predominant localization in the cytosol, \u03b1-syn is generally considered exclusively an intracellular protein. Contrary to this assumption, here, we show that a small percentage of newly synthesized \u03b1-syn is rapidly secreted from cells via unconventional, endoplasmic reticulum\/Golgi-independent exocytosis. Consistent with this finding, we also demonstrate that a portion of cellular \u03b1-syn is present in the lumen of vesicles.

The TLR2 ligand activity of \u03b1-synuclein is conformation-sensitive; only specific types of oligomer can interact with and activate TLR2.

            "Abnormal folding and accumulation of a-synuclein is implicated in several neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease. Although a-synuclein is a typical cytoplasmic protein, a small amount of both monomeric and aggregated forms is secreted from cells and is present in human body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid. Extracellular a-synuclein aggregates have been shown to be neurotoxic, posing a challenge to any cell exposed to them. Here, we examine the internalization of various forms of extracellular a-synuclein, including fibrils, oligomers, and monomer, into neuronal cells and their subsequent degradation. Internalization of fibrillar a-synuclein could be inhibited by low temperature or the expression of a dominant-negative mutant dynamin-1 K44A, suggesting the endocytosis-mediated internalization. The internalized fibrils moved through the endosomal pathway and were degraded in the lysosome \u2026",

            "Cytoplasmic deposition of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates is a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Strong evidence for the causative role of \u03b1-synuclein in these disorders is provided by genetic linkage between this gene and familial Parkinson9s disease and by neurodegeneration in transgenic animals that overexpress this protein. In particular, it has been hypothesized that the accumulation of nonfibrillar oligomers of \u03b1-synuclein, which serve as intermediates for fibrillar inclusion body formation, causes neurodegeneration. However, little is known about how cells handle potentially toxic protein aggregates. Here we demonstrate that cells are capable of clearing preformed \u03b1-synuclein aggregates via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Consequently, blocking this pathway causes the accumulation of the aggregates in non-neuronal cells, differentiated neuroblastoma cells, and primary \u2026",

However, the nature of pathogenic aggregates and the biological consequences of their formation remain elusive. Here, we describe (i) a model cellular system in which prefibrillar \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and fibrillar inclusions are naturally formed in the cytoplasm with distinctive kinetics and (ii) a tight correlation between the presence of prefibrillar aggregates and the Golgi fragmentation. Consistent with the structural abnormality of Golgi apparatus, trafficking and maturation of dopamine transporter through the biosynthetic pathway were impaired in the presence of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Reduction in cell viability was also observed in the prefibrillar aggregate-forming condition and before the inclusion formation. The fibrillar inclusions, on the other hand, showed no correlation with \u2026",
