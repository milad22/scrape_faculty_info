Further, bedrock channels communicate tectonic and climatic signals across the landscape, thus dictating, to first order, the dynamic response of mountainous landscapes to external forcings. We review and explore the stream\u2010power erosion model in an effort to (1) elucidate its consequences in terms of large\u2010scale topographic (fluvial) relief and its sensitivity to tectonic and climatic forcing, (2) derive a relationship for system response time to tectonic perturbations, (3) determine the sensitivity of model behavior to various model parameters, and (4) integrate the above to suggest useful guidelines for further study of bedrock channel systems and for future refinement of the streampower erosion law.

Quantitative field assessments of process-based laws are needed to accurately describe landscape uplift and denudation in response to tectonics and climate. We evaluate and calibrate the shear stress (or similar unit stream-power) bedrock-incision model by studying stream profiles in a tectonically active mountain range. Previous work on emergent marine terraces in the Mendocino triple junction region of northern California provides spatial and temporal control on rock-uplift rates. Digital elevation models and field data are used to quantify differences in landscape morphology associated with along-strike northwest to southeast changes in tectonic and climatic conditions.

The consequences of several different hillslope process laws are explored in a series of experiments with a numerical model of drainage basin evolution. Five different models are considered, including a simple diffusive\u2010advective process transition, a runoff generation threshold, an erosion threshold, and two types of threshold\u2010activated landsliding. These different hillslope processes alter both the visual appearance of the landscape and the predicted relationship between slope and contributing area. On the basis of the different threshold theories, we derive expressions for the relationships between drainage density and environmental factors such as rainfall, relief, and mean erosion rate. These relationships vary depending on the dominant hillslope threshold. In particular, the sign of the predicted relationship between \u2026",

The sensitivity of such basins to climate change is analyzed using a physically based model of drainage basin evolution. The GOLEM model simulates basin evolution under the action of weathering processes, hillslope transport, and fluvial bedrock erosion and sediment transport. Results from perturbation analyses reveal that the nature and timescale of basin response depends on the direction of change. An increase in runoff intensity (or a decrease in vegetation cover) will lead to a rapid expansion of the channel network, with the resulting increase in sediment supply initially generating aggradation along the main network, followed by downcutting as the sediment supply tapers off. By contrast, a decrease in runoff intensity (or an increase in the erosion threshold \u2026",

This observation suggests that incision processes are more effective in the HUZ. It motivates a detailed field study of channel morphology in the differing tectonic settings to test whether various factors that are hypothesized to influence incision rates (discharge, channel width, lithology, sediment load) change in response to uplift or otherwise differ between the HUZ and LUZ.

            "Mechanistic theories of fluvial erosion are essential for quantifying large\u2010scale orogenic denudation. We examine the topographic implications of two leading classes of river erosion model, detachment\u2010limited and transport\u2010limited, in order to identify diagnostic and testable differences between them. Several formulations predict distinctly different longitudinal profile shapes, which are shown to be closely linked to terrain morphology. Of these, some can be rejected on the basis of unrealistic morphology and slope\u2010area scaling. An expression is derived for total drainage basin relief and its apportionment between hillslope and fluvial components. Relief and valley density are found to vary with tectonic forcing in a manner that reflects erosion physics; these properties therefore constitute an additional set of testable predictions. Finally, transient responses to tectonic perturbations are shown to depend strongly on the \u2026",

            "We describe a new set of data structures and algorithms for dynamic terrain modeling using a triangulated irregular network (TINs). The framework provides an efficient method for storing, accessing, and updating a Delaunay triangulation and its associated Voronoi diagram. The basic data structure consists of three interconnected data objects: triangles, nodes, and directed edges. Encapsulating each of these geometric elements within a data object makes it possible to essentially decouple the TIN representation from the modeling applications that make use of it. Both the triangulation and its corresponding Voronoi diagram can be rapidly retrieved or updated, making these methods well suited to adaptive remeshing schemes. We develop a set of algorithms for defining drainage networks and identifying closed depressions (e.g., lakes) for hydrologic and geomorphic modeling applications. We also outline simple \u2026",
