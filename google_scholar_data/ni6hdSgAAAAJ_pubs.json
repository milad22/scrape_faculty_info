Theory predicts that parametric resonances occur near drive frequencies of 2\u03c9 0\/n, where \u03c9 0 is the system's natural frequency and n is an integer\u2a7e 1. But in macroscopic systems, only the first instability region can typically be observed, because of damping and the exponential narrowing 10 of the regions with increasing n. Here we report parametrically excited torsional oscillations in a single-crystal silicon microelectromechanical system. Five instability regions can be measured, due to the low damping, stability and precise frequency control achievable in this system. The centre frequencies of the instability regions agree with \u2026",

            "A new mechanical scanner design for a high-speed atomic force microscope (AFM) is presented and discussed in terms of modeling and control. The positioning range of this scanner is 13 mum in the X- and Y-directions and 4.3 mum in the vertical direction. The lowest resonance frequency of this scanner is above 22 kHz. This paper is focused on the vertical direction of the scanner, being the crucial axis of motion with the highest precision and bandwidth requirements for gentle imaging with the AFM. A second- and a fourth-order mathematical model of the scanner are derived that allow new insights into important design parameters. Proportional-integral (Pl)-feedback control of the high-speed scanner is discussed and the performance of the new AFM is demonstrated by imaging a calibration grating and a biological sample at 8 frames\/s.",

            "Parametric resonance has been well established in many areas of science, including the stability of ships, the forced motion of a swing and Faraday surface wave patterns on water. We have previously investigated a linear parametrically driven torsional oscillator and along with other groups have mentioned applications including mass sensing, parametric amplification, and others. Here, we thoroughly investigate the design of a highly sensitive mass sensor. The device we use to carry out this study is an in-plane parametrically resonant oscillator. We show that in this configuration, the nonlinearities (electrostatic and mechanical) have a large impact on the dynamic response of the structure. This result is not unique to this oscillator\u2014many MEMS oscillators display nonlinearities of equal importance (including the very common parallel plate actuator).

The benefits of such an approach include smaller size, lower damping, and improved performance metrics.

The particular systems of interest are those which feature parametric excitation that arises from forces produced by fluctuating voltages applied across comb drives. These systems are known to exhibit a wide range of behaviors, some of which have escaped explanation or prediction. In this paper we examine a general governing equation of motion for these systems and use it to provide a complete description of the dynamic response and its dependence on the system parameters. The defining feature of this equation is that both the linear and cubic terms feature parametric excitation which, in comparison to the case of purely linear parametric excitation (e.g. the Mathieu equation), significantly complicates the system's dynamics.
