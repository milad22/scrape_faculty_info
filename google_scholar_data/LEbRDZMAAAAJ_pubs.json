            "We report the first successful study of the use of Raman spectroscopy for quantitative, noninvasive (\"transcutaneous\") measurement of blood analytes, using glucose as an example. As an initial evaluation of the ability of Raman spectroscopy to measure glucose transcutaneously, we studied 17 healthy human subjects whose blood glucose levels were elevated over a period of 2\u20133 h using a standard glucose tolerance test protocol. During the test, 461 Raman spectra were collected transcutaneously along with glucose reference values provided by standard capillary blood analysis. A partial least squares calibration was created from the data from each subject and validated using leave-one-out cross validation. The mean absolute errors for each subject were 7.8%\u00b11.8% (mean\u00b1std) with R2 values of 0.83\u00b10.10. We provide spectral evidence that the glucose spectrum is an important part of the calibrations by \u2026",

            "Plasmonic metal nanostructures have shown great potential in sensing, photovoltaics, imaging and biomedicine, principally due to the enhancement of local electric field by light-excited surface plasmons, i.e., collective oscillation of conduction band electrons. Thin films of nanoporous gold have received a great deal of interest due to the unique 3-dimensional bicontinuous nanostructures with high specific surface area. However, in the form of semi-infinite thin films, nanoporous gold exhibits weak plasmonic extinction and little tunability in the plasmon resonance, because the pore size is much smaller than the wavelength of light. Here we show that by making nanoporous gold in the form of disks of sub-wavelength diameter and sub-100 nm thickness, these limitations can be overcome.
