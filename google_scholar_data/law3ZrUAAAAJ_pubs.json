            "Kisspeptin and its receptor GPR54 have recently been identified as key signaling partners in the neural control of fertility in animal models and humans. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent the final output neurons of the neural network controlling fertility and are suspected to be the primary locus of kisspeptin\u2013GPR54 signaling. Using mouse models, the present study addressed whether kisspeptin and GPR54 have a key role in the activation of GnRH neurons to generate the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge responsible for ovulation. Dual-label immunocytochemistry experiments showed that 40\u201360% of kisspeptin neurons in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) expressed estrogen receptor \u03b1 and progesterone receptors. Using an ovariectomized, gonadal steroid-replacement regimen, which reliably generates an LH surge, \u223c30% of RP3V kisspeptin neurons were \u2026",

            "Molecular cloning of cockroach allergens and their expression as recombinant proteins have allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms of cockroach allergic disease. Recombinant cockroach allergens have been used for skin testing or in vitro methods to measure IgE antibody levels in serum. Early studies evaluating selected U.S. patients revealed that a cocktail of four cockroach allergens, Bla g 1, Bla g 2, Bla g 4, and Bla g 5, would identify 95 % of cockroach allergic patients. More recent studies pointed to an important role of sensitization to tropomyosin among certain populations, and suggested that a cocktail of five allergens Bla g 1 and\/or Per a 1, Bla g 2, Bla g 4, Bla g 5, and Bla g 7, and\/or Per a 7, would be expected to diagnose 50\u2013 64 % of cockroach-allergic patients worldwide. Variation in IgE reactivity profiles could be in part due to IgE responses to cross-reactive homologous allergens \u2026",

It is caused by deficiency of the C1 inhibitor protein, leading to elevated levels of bradykinin. More than 200 mutations in C1 inhibitor gene have been reported.

The skin of patients with moderate to severe AD is characterized by significant barrier disruption and T helper 2 (Th2)-driven inflammation, which are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Current management of AD is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory response and restoring the barrier function of the skin, reducing exacerbations, and preventing secondary skin infections. Combinations of treatment strategies are used to alleviate the symptoms of the disease; however, resolution is often temporary, and long-term usage of some of the medications for AD can be associated with significant side effects. Antibody therapies previously approved for other inflammatory diseases have been evaluated in patients with AD. Unfortunately, they have often failed to result in significant clinical \u2026",
