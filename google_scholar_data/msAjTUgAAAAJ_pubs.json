            "We show that there exists a consistent truncation of 11 dimensional supergravity to the `massless' fields of maximal (N=4) 7 dimensional gauged supergravity. We find the complete expressions for the nonlinear embedding of the 7 dimensional fields into the 11 dimensional fields, and check them by reproducing the d=7 susy transformation laws from the d=11 laws in various sectors. In particular we determine explicitly the matrix U which connects the Killing spinors to the gravitinos in the KK ansatz, and the dependence of the 4-index field strength on the scalars. This is the first time a complete nonlinear KK reduction of the original d=11 supergravity on a nontrivial compact space has been explicitly given. We need a first order formulation for the 3 index tensor field A\u039b\u03a0\u03a3 in d=11 to reproduce the 7 dimensional result. The concept of `self-duality in odd dimensions' is thus shown to originate from first order formalism in \u2026",

The ansatz itself is nonpolynomial but the final d= 7 results are polynomial. The correct d= 7 scalar potential is obtained. For most of our results the explicit form of the matrix U connecting the d= 7 gravitino to the Killing spinor is not needed, but we derive the equation which U has to satisfy and present the general solution. Requiring that the expression\u03b4F= d\u03b4A in d= 11 can be written as \u03b4d (fields in d= 7), we find the ansatz for the 4-form F. It satisfies the Bianchi identities.

Using the entanglement Hamiltonian, we calculate the first order change in the entanglement entropy due to changes in conserved charges of the ground state, and find a local first law-like relation for the entanglement entropy. Our approach provides a field theory derivation and generalization of recent results obtained by holographic techniques.

We complete the standard metric ansatz by providing an analytic expression for the warp factor, under the assumption of a logarithmically running axion-dilaton. From the gauge dual perspective, this behavior is related to the positive beta function of the N= 4, d= 4 SU (N c) super Yang-Mills gauge theory, coupled to N f fundamental N= 2 hypermultiplets. We comment on the existence of tadpoles and relate them to the same gauge theory beta function.

            "We attempt to obtain realistic glueball Regge trajectories from the gauge\/string correspondence. To this end we study closed spinning string configurations in two supergravity backgrounds: Klebanov\u2013Strassler (KS) and Maldacena\u2013Nunez (MN) which are dual to confining gauge theories. These backgrounds represent two embeddings of N= 1 SYM, in the large rank N limit, in string theory. The classical configuration that we consider is that of a folded closed string spinning in a supergravity region with vanishing transverse radius (\u03c4= 0) which is dual to the IR of the gauge theory. Classically, a spinning string yields a linear Regge trajectory with zero intercept. By performing a semi-classical analysis we find that quantum effects alter both the linearity of the trajectory and the vanishing classical intercept: J\u2261 \u03b1 (t)= \u03b1 0+ \u03b1\u2032 t+ \u03b2 t. Two features of our Regge trajectories are compatible with the experimental pomeron \u2026",
