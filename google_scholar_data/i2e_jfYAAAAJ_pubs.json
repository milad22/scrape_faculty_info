Unlike nonlinear Dirac equations posited by particle theorists, which are designed to preserve the principle of relativity, i.e., Poincar\u00e9 covariance, the nonlinear Dirac equation for Bose\u2013Einstein condensates breaks this symmetry. We present a rigorous derivation of the nonlinear Dirac equation from first principles. We provide a thorough discussion of all symmetries broken and maintained.",

Excitations in the remaining large direction of the lattice correspond to the linear subbands in the armchair nanoribbon spectrum. Analytical as well as numerical soliton Dirac spinor solutions are obtained. We analyze the solution space of the quasi-1D NLDE by finding fixed points, delineating the various regions in solution space, and through an invariance relation which we obtain as a first integral of the NLDE. We obtain spatially oscillating multi-soliton solutions as well as asymptotically flat single soliton solutions using five different methods: by direct integration; an \u2026",

A full derivation of the relativistic linear stability equations (RLSE) is presented by two independent methods to ensure veracity of our results. Solutions of the RLSE are used to compute fluctuations and lifetimes of vortex solutions of the nonlinear Dirac equation, which include Anderson\u2013Toulouse skyrmions with lifetime  s. Beyond vortex stabilities the RLSE provide insight into the character of collective superfluid excitations, which we find to encode several established theories of physics.
