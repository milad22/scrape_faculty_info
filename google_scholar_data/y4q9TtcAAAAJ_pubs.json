Illustris is a suite of large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo and including a comprehensive set of physical models critical for following the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Each simulates a volume of (106.5 Mpc) 3 and self-consistently evolves five different types of resolution elements from a starting redshift of z= 127 to the present day, z= 0. These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run. These include three resolution levels with \u2026",

            "Mergers of galaxies are thought to cause significant gas inflows to the inner parsecs, which can activate rapid accretion on to supermassive black holes (SMBHs), giving rise to active galactic nuclei (AGN). During a significant fraction of this process, SMBHs are predicted to be enshrouded by gas and dust. Studying 52 galactic nuclei in infrared-selected local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies in different merger stages in the hard X-ray band, where radiation is less affected by absorption, we find that the amount of material around SMBHs increases during the last phases of the merger. We find that the fraction of Compton-thick (CT, N\u2009H \u2265 1024\u2009cm\u2212 2) AGN in late-merger galaxies is higher () than in local hard X-ray selected AGN (f\u2009CT = 27 \u00b1 4\u2009per\u2009cent), and that obscuration reaches its maximum when the nuclei of the two merging galaxies are at a projected distance of D12 \u2243 0.4\u201310.8 \u2026",

            "Gravitational-wave recoil of merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may influence the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. We examine this possibility using smoothed particle hydrodynamic\/N-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers, including SMBH accretion, in which the merged BH receives a recoil kick. This enables us to follow the trajectories and accretion of recoiling BHs in self-consistent, evolving merger remnants. In contrast to recent studies on similar topics, we conduct a large parameter study, generating a suite of over 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models and a range of recoil velocities (vk). With this, we can identify systematic trends in the behaviour of recoiling BHs. Our main results are as follows. (1) BHs kicked at nearly the central escape speed (vesc) may oscillate on large orbits for up to a Hubble time, but in gas-rich mergers, BHs kicked with up to \u223c0.7vesc \u2026",

            "Simulations of binary black hole mergers indicate that asymmetrical gravitational wave (GW) emission can cause black holes to recoil at speeds up to thousands of km s\u22121. These GW recoil events can dramatically affect the co-evolution of recoiling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However, theoretical studies of SMBH\u2013galaxy evolution almost always assume a stationary central black hole. In light of the numerical results on GW recoil velocities, we relax that assumption here and consider the consequences of recoil for SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a smooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a multicomponent gaseous disc. In addition, we calculate the accretion rate on to the SMBH as a function of time, using a hybrid prescription of viscous (\u03b1-disc) and Bondi accretion.
