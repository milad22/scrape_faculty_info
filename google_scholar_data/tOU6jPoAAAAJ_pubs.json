            "The ratio of the proton's elastic electromagnetic form factors, G E p\/G M p, was obtained by measuring P t and P \u2113, the transverse and the longitudinal recoil proton polarization, respectively. For elastic e\u2192 p\u2192 e p\u2192, G E p\/G M p is proportional to P t\/P \u2113. Simultaneous measurement of P t and P \u2113 in a polarimeter provides good control of the systematic uncertainty. The results for the ratio G E p\/G M p show a systematic decrease as Q 2 increases from 0.5 to 3.5 GeV 2, indicating for the first time a definite difference in the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization currents in the proton.",

In the single-photon exchange approximation, G Ep\/G Mp is directly proportional to P t\/P \u2113. The simultaneous measurement of P t and P \u2113 in a polarimeter reduces systematic uncertainties. The results for G Ep\/G Mp show a systematic decrease with increasing Q 2, indicating for the first time a definite difference in the distribution of charge and magnetization in the proton. The data have been reanalyzed and their systematic uncertainties have become significantly smaller than those reported previously.",
