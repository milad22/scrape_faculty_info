The direct route, by avoiding several wet chemical steps and accompanying mechanical stresses and contamination common to all presently reported layer-area graphene transfer methods, enables fabrication of layer-area graphene devices with unprecedented quality. To demonstrate, we directly transfer layer-area graphene from Cu growth substrates to holey amorphous carbon transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids, resulting in robust, clean, full-coverage graphene grids ideal for high resolution TEM.",

For graphene, an ideal two-dimensional material, folding may transform it to complex shapes with new and distinct properties. Here, we present experimental results that folded structures in graphene, termed grafold, exist, and their formations can be controlled by introducing anisotropic surface curvature during graphene synthesis or transfer processes. Using pseudopotential-density-functional-theory calculations, we also show that double folding modifies the electronic band structure of graphene. Furthermore, we demonstrate the intercalation of C 60 into the grafolds. Intercalation or functionalization of the chemically reactive folds further expands grafold's mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic diversity.",

Despite the motion and random orientation of nitrogen-vacancy centers suspended in the optical trap, we observe distinct peaks in the measured ESR spectra qualitatively similar to the same measurement in bulk. Accounting for the random dynamics, we model the ESR spectra observed in an externally applied magnetic field to enable dc magnetometry in solution. We estimate the dc magnetic field sensitivity based on variations in ESR line shapes to be approximately .
