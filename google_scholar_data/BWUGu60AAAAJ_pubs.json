In contrast to established \u201ctop-down\u201d fabrication techniques, molecular self-assembly is emerging as a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach for fabricating nanostructured materials. Biological macromolecules, especially proteins, provide many valuable properties, but poor physical stability and poor electrical characteristics have prevented their direct use in electrical circuits. Here we describe the use of self-assembling amyloid protein fibers to construct nanowire elements. Self-assembly of a prion determinant from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the N-terminal and middle region (NM) of Sup35p, produced 10-nm-wide protein fibers that were stable under a wide variety of harsh physical conditions. Their lengths could be roughly controlled by assembly conditions in the \u2026",

Coupling between local curvature and chemical composition in membranes could provide a means of mechanically controlling the spatial organization of membrane components. Although this concept has surfaced repeatedly over the years, controlled experimental investigations have proven elusive. Here, we introduce an experimental platform, in which microfabricated surfaces impose specific curvature patterns onto lipid bilayers, that allows quantification of mechanochemical couplings in membranes. We find that, beyond a critical curvature value, membrane geometry governs the spatial ordering of phase-separated domain structures in membranes composed of cholesterol and phospholipids.

In monolayers of weakly coupled gold nanocrystals, quenched charge disorder produces a range of local thresholds for the onset of electron tunneling. Our measurements delineate two regimes separated by a crossover temperature T*. Up to T* the nonlinear zero-temperature shape of the current-voltage curves survives, but with a threshold voltage for conduction that decreases linearly with temperature. Above T* the threshold vanishes and the low-bias conductance increases rapidly with temperature. We develop a model that accounts for these findings and predicts T*.",

Additionally, the MeRho-Az scaffold is less susceptible to photoactivation than other commonly used azide-based systems, increasing its potential application in imaging experiments.
