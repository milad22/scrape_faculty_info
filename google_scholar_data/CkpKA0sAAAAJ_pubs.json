            "We obtain first order equations that determine a supersymmetric kink solution in five-dimensional N= 8 gauged supergravity. The kink interpolates between an exterior anti-de Sitter region with maximal supersymmetry and an interior anti-de Sitter region with one quarter of the maximal supersymmetry. One eighth of supersymmetry is preserved by the kink as a whole. We interpret it as describing the renormalization group flow in N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory broken to an N= 1 theory by the addition of a mass term for one of the three adjoint chiral superfields. A detailed correspondence is obtained between fields of bulk supergravity in the interior anti-de Sitter region and composite operators of the infrared field theory. We also point out that the truncation used to find the reduced symmetry critical point can be extended to obtain a new N= 4 gauged supergravity theory holographically dual to a sector of N= 2 gauge theories based on quiver diagrams.We consider more general kink geometries and construct a c-function that is positive and monotonic if a weak energy condition holds in the bulk gravity theory. For even-dimensional boundaries, the c-function coincides with the trace anomaly coefficients of the holographically related field theory in limits where conformal invariance is recovered.",

This has important consequences for the running of the gauge coupling in massive perturbations of the AdS\/CFT correspondence. We conjecture an exact analytic expression for the ten-dimensional dilaton in terms of five-dimensional quantities, and we test this conjecture. Specifically, we construct a family of solutions to IIB supergravity that preserve half of the supersymmetries, and are lifts of supersymmetric flows in five-dimensional, gauged N= 8 supergravity. Via the AdS\/CFT correspondence these flows correspond to softly broken N= 4, large N Yang\u2013Mills theory on part of the Coulomb branch of N= 2 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills. Our solutions involve non-trivial backgrounds for all the tensor gauge fields as well as for the dilaton and axion.",

The critical points give rise to Anti-de Sitter vacua, and preserve at least an SU (2) gauge symmetry. Consistent truncation implies that these solutions correspond to Anti-de Sitter compactifications of IIB supergravity, and hence to possible near-horizon geometries of 3-branes. Thus we find new conformal phases of softly broken N= 4 Yang\u2013Mills theory. One of the critical points preserves N= 2 supersymmetry in the bulk and is therefore completely stable, and corresponds to an N= 1 superconformal fixed point of the Yang\u2013Mills theory.

The Liouville system is represented by a free scalar field,\u03c6  L , with background charge such that the BRST operator imposing reparametrization invariance is nilpotent. We compute the cohomology of this BRST charge on the product of the Fock space of\u03c6  L  with those of the ghosts and one other free scalar field,\u03c6  M  representing the matter system. From this calculation the physical states of the full theory are determined. For thec<1 case the further projection from the Fock space of\u03c6  M  to the irreducible representation, using Felder's resolution, reproduces the results of Lian and Zuckerman.",

We explicitly construct the complete ten-dimensional lift of the flow in which exactly one chiral superfield becomes massive (the LS flow). We also examine the ten-dimensional metric and dilaton configurations for the``super-QCD''flow (the GPPZ flow) in which all chiral superfields become massive. We show that the latter flow generically gives rise to a dielectric 7-brane in the infra-red, but the solution contains a singularity that may be interpreted as a``duality averaged''ring distribution of 5-branes wrapped on S^ 2. At special values of the parameters the singularity simplifies to a pair of S-dual branes with (p, q) charge (1,\\pm 1).",

We study the latter case, with attention to its connection with a possible gauged {ce:inline-formula}N = 4{\/ce:inline-formula} supergravity in {ce:inline-formula}d = 7{\/ce:inline-formula}. We derive the linearized field equations and supersymmetry transformation rules for the effective {ce:inline-formula}d = 7{\/ce:inline-formula} supergravity multiplet. There are five third rank antisymmetric tensors in this multiplet which are in the 5 representation of the gauge group USp(4) and they are propagated with a self-duality condition in 7 dimensions. There is also a 14 of scalar fields and they are found to propagate with a non-conformal wave operator.",
