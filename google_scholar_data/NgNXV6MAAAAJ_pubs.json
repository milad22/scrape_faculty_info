            "The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV) of the IMAGE Mission will study the distribution of He+ in Earth\u2019s plasmasphere by detecting its resonantly-scattered emission at 30.4 nm. It will record the structure and dynamics of the cold plasma in Earth\u2019s plasmasphere on a global scale. The 30.4-nm feature is relatively easy to measure because it is the brightest ion emission from the plasmasphere, it is spectrally isolated, and the background at that wavelength is negligible. Measurements are easy to interpret because the plasmaspheric He+ emission is optically thin, so its brightness is directly proportional to the He+ column abundance. Effective imaging of the plasmaspheric He+ requires global\u2019 snapshots\u2019 in which the high apogee and the wide field of view of EUV provide in a single exposure a map of the entire plasmasphere. EUV consists of three identical sensor heads, each having a field of view 30\u00b0 in \u2026",

One purpose of the lens is to show refraction of sound waves in an analogy to geometric optics. We discuss the physics of the balloon lens demonstration. To determine the validity of a gas-filled balloon as a classroom demonstration of an acoustic lens and to understand the corresponding phenomena, its physics is considered analytically, numerically, and experimentally. Our results show that although a geometric analogy is a good first-order approximation, scattering theory is required to fully understand the observed phenomena. Thus this demonstration can be adapted to a wide range of students, from those learning the basic principles of refraction to advanced students studying scattering.",

Using this approach we have coated a set of six mirrors for the EUV Imager, a component of the IMAGE mission. This mission is a Medium Explorer (MIDEX) program, which is scheduled for launch early in 2000. The EUV Imager will study the distribution of He+ in the Earth's plasmasphere by detecting its resonantly scattered emission at 30.4 nm (41 eV) and will produce images of the structure and dynamics of the cold plasma on a global scale. There is, however, a bright emission at 58.4 nm (21 eV), which comes from neutral helium in the earth's ionosphere which also must be blocked. These photons are at too high an energy to filter with aluminum but at too low an energy to have negligible reflectance from most materials commonly used in EUV mirrors.

This suggests that uranium could be used to produce high reflectance imaging mirrors for many soft x-ray applications.  Elemental uranium is too chemically active to be used as a front surface mirror without protection. We computed the expected reflectance of carbon-coated uranium films and of uranium-nickel alloys for low-angle reflectors.  Carbon is mostly transparent below its K absorption edge at about 283 eV.  The reflectance at 10 degrees from grazing is computed to be greater than 50% at 277 eV (C K\u03b1).  For comparison, about 5 degrees is the maximum grazing incidence angle for which conventional materials are computed to have comparable reflectance.
