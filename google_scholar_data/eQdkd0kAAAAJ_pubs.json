            "Integrated optical modulators with high modulation speed, small footprint and large optical bandwidth are poised to be the enabling devices for on-chip optical interconnects 1, 2. Semiconductor modulators have therefore been heavily researched over the past few years. However, the device footprint of silicon-based modulators is of the order of millimetres, owing to its weak electro-optical properties 3. Germanium and compound semiconductors, on the other hand, face the major challenge of integration with existing silicon electronics and photonics platforms 4, 5, 6. Integrating silicon modulators with high-quality-factor optical resonators increases the modulation strength, but these devices suffer from intrinsic narrow bandwidth and require sophisticated optical design; they also have stringent fabrication requirements and limited temperature tolerances 7.

They have a fundamental role in the dynamic responses of electron systems and form the basis of research into optical metamaterials 1, 2, 3. Plasmons of two-dimensional massless electrons, as present in graphene, show unusual behaviour 4, 5, 6, 7 that enables new tunable plasmonic metamaterials 8, 9, 10 and, potentially, optoelectronic applications in the terahertz frequency range 8, 9, 11, 12. Here we explore plasmon excitations in engineered graphene micro-ribbon arrays. We demonstrate that graphene plasmon resonances can be tuned over a broad terahertz frequency range by changing micro-ribbon width and in situ electrostatic doping. The ribbon width and carrier doping dependences of graphene plasmon frequency demonstrate power-law behaviour characteristic of two-dimensional massless Dirac electrons 4, 5, 6.

            "The unique electronic structure of graphene leads to several distinctive optical properties. In this brief review, we outline the current understanding of two general aspects of optical response of graphene: optical absorption and light emission. We show that optical absorption in graphene is dominated by intraband transitions at low photon energies (in the far-infrared spectral range) and by interband transitions at higher energies (from mid-infrared to ultraviolet). We discuss how the intraband and interband transitions in graphene can be modified through electrostatic gating. We describe plasmonic resonances arising from the free-carrier (intraband) response and excitonic effects that are manifested in the interband absorption. Light emission, the reverse process of absorption, is weak in graphene due to the absence of a band gap. We show that photoluminescence from hot electrons can, however, become \u2026",

A tunable bandgap can be induced in bilayer graphene by an external electric field 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and such gapped bilayer graphene is predicted to be a topological insulating phase protected by no-valley mixing symmetry, featuring quantum valley Hall effects and chiral edge states 6, 7, 8, 9. Observation of such chiral edge states, however, is challenging because inter-valley scattering is induced by atomic-scale defects at real bilayer graphene edges 10. Recent theoretical work 11, 12, 13 has shown that domain walls between AB-and BA-stacked bilayer graphene can support protected chiral edge states of quantum valley Hall insulators.

Transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the CNS has a tube-like structure with a hollow core surrounded by graphene walls 0.35 nm apart. Raman spectroscopy studies show that the CNS is free of significant defects, and the electronic structure and phonon dispersion are slightly different from those of two-dimensional graphene. Finally, the CNS-based device is fabricated, directly on the SiO2\/Si substrate. Electrical-transport measurements show that its resistance is weakly gate-dependent but strongly temperature-dependent. In addition, the CNS can sustain a high current density up to 5 \u00d7 107 A\/cm2, indicating that it is a good candidate for microcircuit interconnects.
