            "This bestseller will help you learn regression-analysis methods that you can apply to real-life problems. It highlights the role of the computer in contemporary statistics with numerous printouts and exercises that you can solve using the computer. The authors continue to emphasize model development, the intuitive logic and assumptions that underlie the techniques covered, the purposes, advantages, and disadvantages of the techniques, and valid interpretations of those techniques.

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) established active, statewide surveillance to describe hospitalized patients with the syndrome. Methods Hospitals in New York State reported cases of Kawasaki\u2019s disease, toxic shock syndrome, myocarditis, and potential MIS-C in hospitalized patients younger than 21 years of age and sent medical records to the NYSDOH. We carried out descriptive analyses that summarized the clinical presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients who met the NYSDOH case definition for MIS-C between March 1 and May 10, 2020. Results As of May 10, 2020, a total of 191 potential cases were reported to the NYSDOH.
