The M II, III (3 p) subshell was studied in Ar, Cu, and Ge, as well as the M IV, V (3 d) and M II, III in Kr, Rh, Xe, Eu, Au, and Fm in an effort to explain the combined Z and energy dependence of the photo-ionization cross sections for these subshells. In addition, calculations have been performed for 3 s, 4 s, 5 s, 4 p, 5 p, 4 d, 5 d, and 4 f subshells in certain elements. The results, which are considerably different from the predictions of the hydrogenlike model, show certain regularities which are explained in terms of the potentials. Comparisons with experiment show that the model correctly predicts the gross spectral shape of photo-ionization cross sections, but the results are somewhat inaccurate in the vicinity of large absorption \u2026",

Its features, which are embodied in a single asymmetry parameter \u03b2 in the electric dipole approximation, are examined within the framework of the angular momentum transfer formulation. The \u03b2 parameter is in principle always energy dependent. Within the LS coupling approximation, however, there are instances, each representing a multitude of particular photoionization processes, in which \u03b2 is an analytically determined constant. The energy dependence of the \u03b2 parameters in such instances is due entirely to spin-orbit and other relativistic interactions. The study of the energy dependence of the \u03b2 parameter in these cases is thus of interest because it spotlights weak-interaction effects which are usually overwhelmed by stronger interactions. We illustrate the general predictions by a detailed consideration of the energy \u2026",

            "A comprehensive study of the angular and energy distributions of electrons ejected in collisions of fast electrons and protons with He is presented. New experimental results for 300-keV, 1-MeV, and 5-MeV proton impact are reported along with theoretical results for 2-keV electron impact and 100-keV, 300-keV, 1-MeV, and 5-MeV proton impact. The theoretical results, based upon Born approximation with Hartree-Slater initial discrete and final continuum wave functions, show excellent agreement with experimental electron-impact results. Serious discrepancies are found between theory and experiment in the angular distribution of ejected electrons for forward angles for 100-and 300-keV proton impact; the discrepancies decrease markedly for 1-MeV proton impact and are absent for 5-MeV protons.

Generalized oscillator strengths and proton energy-loss cross sections from threshold to ionized-electron energies of 128 Ry have been calculated. The results show a delayed maximum above threshold, and the ramifications of this phenomenon are discussed. Comparison is made with hydrogenic results and good agreement is found at intermediate and large energy loss, but the hydrogenic calculation is totally inadequate near threshold. The implications of this for stopping-power calculations and subshell corrections is discussed. The Bethe asymptotic cross section is obtained and the variation of parameters therein is investigated.",
