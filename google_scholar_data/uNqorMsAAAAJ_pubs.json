            "In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect the copy-move forgery in an image, mainly by extracting the keypoints for comparison. The main difference to the traditional methods is that the proposed scheme first segments the test image into semantically independent patches prior to keypoint extraction. As a result, the copy-move regions can be detected by matching between these patches. The matching process consists of two stages. In the first stage, we find the suspicious pairs of patches that may contain copy-move forgery regions, and we roughly estimate an affine transform matrix. In the second stage, an Expectation-Maximization-based algorithm is designed to refine the estimated matrix and to confirm the existence of copy-move forgery. Experimental results prove the good performance of the proposed scheme via comparing it with the state-of-the-art schemes on the public databases.",

            "Prediction-error expansion (PEE) is an important technique of reversible watermarking which can embed large payloads into digital images with low distortion. In this paper, the PEE technique is further investigated and an efficient reversible watermarking scheme is proposed, by incorporating in PEE two new strategies, namely, adaptive embedding and pixel selection. Unlike conventional PEE which embeds data uniformly, we propose to adaptively embed 1 or 2 bits into expandable pixel according to the local complexity. This avoids expanding pixels with large prediction-errors, and thus, it reduces embedding impact by decreasing the maximum modification to pixel values. Meanwhile, adaptive PEE allows very large payload in a single embedding pass, and it improves the capacity limit of conventional PEE. We also propose to select pixels of smooth area for data embedding and leave rough pixels unchanged \u2026",

However, the correlations among prediction-errors are not considered and utilized in current PEE based methods. Specifically, in PEE, the prediction-errors are modified individually in data embedding. In this paper, to better exploit these correlations, instead of utilizing prediction-errors individually, we propose to consider every two adjacent prediction-errors jointly to generate a sequence consisting of prediction-error pairs. Then, based on the sequence and the resulting 2D prediction-error histogram, a more efficient embedding strategy, namely, pairwise PEE, can be designed to achieve an improved performance.

Moreover, by taking specific shifting and embedding functions, we show that several RDH algorithms reported in the literature are special cases of this general construction. In addition, two novel and efficient RDH algorithms are also introduced to further demonstrate the universality and applicability of our framework.

Then the maximum and minimum values of each block are predicted by other pixels of the block according to their pixel value orders. With such a PVO-based predictor, data embedding is implemented via PEE. The incorporation of PVO into PEE has an advantage in reducing the number of shifted pixels, and thus it can alleviate the degradation in image quality. Consequently, the proposed method can embed adequate data into a host image with rather limited distortion. The PSNR of a marked image versus its original one is guaranteed to be above 51.14 dB.
