In contrast with the predicted commensurate spin-density-wave order at the nesting wave vector (\u03c0, 0), a completely different magnetic order with a composition tunable propagation vector (\u03b4 \u03c0, \u03b4 \u03c0) was determined for the parent compound Fe 1+ y Te in this powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction study. The new antiferromagnetic order survives as a short-range one even in the highest T C sample. An alternative to the prevailing nesting Fermi surface mechanism is required to understand the latest family of ferrous superconductors.",

Measurements of transport, magnetization, and polarized neutron reflectivity reveal that the ferromagnetism is relatively uniform in the metallic state, and is strongly modulated in the insulating state, being high in LaMnO 3 and suppressed in SrMnO 3. The modulation is consistent with a Mott transition driven by the proximity between the (LaMnO 3)\/(SrMnO 3) interfaces. The insulating state for n\u2265 3 obeys variable range hopping at low temperatures. We suggest that this is due to states at the Fermi level that emerge at the (LaMnO 3)\/(SrMnO 3) interfaces and are localized by disorder.",

The key issue for these materials is to understand the limits between their physical properties (transport, magnetism, mechanical, etc.) and their chemical\u2013physical structure. In principle, a detailed knowledge of the chemical and physical structures allows calculation of their physical properties. Theoretical and computational methods are rapidly evolving so that magnetic properties of nanostructured materials might soon be predicted. Success in this endeavor requires detailed quantitative understanding of magnetic structure at the microscopic level. Neutron scattering is a well-developed technique that can determine magnetic structure at the atomic length scale in samples of ever diminishing size.

Consistent with this behaviour, the strain distribution determined from the width of intensity peaks was significantly broader in the nanocrystalline sample than in the coarse-grained sample.

            "We present an investigation of the effect of ferromagnetic layer thickness on the exchange bias and coercivity enhancement in antiferromagnet\/ferromagnet bilayers. At low temperatures both the exchange bias and coercivity closely follow an inverse thickness relationship, contrary to several recent theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the coercivity as a function of the ferromagnet thickness provides clear evidence for the existence of two distinct regimes. These regimes were probed with conventional magnetometry, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and polarized neutron reflectometry. At low thickness the coercivity exhibits a monotonic temperature dependence, whereas at higher thickness a broad maximum occurs in the vicinity of the N\u00e9el temperature. These regimes are delineated by a particular ratio of the ferromagnet to antiferromagnet thickness. We propose that the ratio of the \u2026",

            "We studied the magnetic properties of La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3\u2215 YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 superlattices. Magnetometry showed that with increasing YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 layer thickness the saturation magnetization per La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3 layer decreases. From polarized neutron reflectometry we determined that this magnetization reduction is due to an inhomogenous magnetization depth profile arising from the suppression of magnetization near the La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3\u2215 YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 interface. Electron energy loss spectroscopy indicates an increased 3 d band occupation of the Mn atoms in the La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3 layers at the interface. Thus, the suppression of ferromagnetic order at the La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3\u2215 YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 interface is most likely due to charge transfer between the two materials.",
