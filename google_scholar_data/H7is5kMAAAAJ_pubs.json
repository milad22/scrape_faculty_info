The reaction fronts travel at a constant velocity that drastically depends on the mean flow direction and rate. The fronts may propagate either downstream and upstream but, surprisingly, they remain static over a range of flow rate values. Resulting from the competition between the chemical reaction and the disordered flow field, these frozen fronts display a particular sawtooth shape. The frozen regime is likely to be associated with front pinning in low velocity zones, the number of which varies with the ratio of the mean flow and the chemical front velocities.",

We measure spatial and temporal fluctuations of the front in 1+ 1 dimensions, controlled by a single parameter, the mean flow velocity. Three distinct universality classes are observed, consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class for fast advancing or receding fronts, the quenched KPZ class (positive-qKPZ) when the mean flow approximately cancels the reaction rate, and the negative-qKPZ class for slowly receding fronts. Both qKPZ classes exhibit distinct depinning transitions, in agreement with the theory.",

The heterogeneities of the porous medium are characterized by the standard deviation of its log-normal distribution of permeability and its correlation length. We focus on the situation where chemical reaction and flow field act in opposite directions. In agreement with previous experiments we observe upstream, downstream fronts as well as static, frozen ones over a range of flow velocity which depends drastically on the heterogeneities of the flow field. The transition between the static regime and the downstream one account for large enough low-velocity zones, whereas the transition from static to upstream regime is found to be given by a kind of percolation path.",

The coupling between autocatalytic reaction front and forced simple hydrodynamic flows leads to stationary fronts whose velocity and shape depend on the underlying flow field. We address the issue of the chemico-hydrodynamic coupling between forced advection in porous media and self-sustained chemical waves. Towards that purpose, we perform experiments over a wide range of flow velocities with the well characterized iodate arsenious acid and chlorite-tetrathionate autocatalytic reactions in transparent packed beads porous media. The characteristics of these porous media such as their porosity, tortuosity, and hydrodynamics dispersion are determined. In a pack of beads, the characteristic pore size and the velocity field correlation length are of the order of the bead size. In order to address \u2026",

The front propagation is controlled by an adverse flow resulting in upstream, static, or downstream regimes. In an earlier study focusing on front shape, we identified three different universality classes associated with this system by following the front dynamics experimentally and numerically. Here, using numerical simulations in the vicinity of the second-order transition, we identify an avalanche dynamics characterized by power-law distributions of avalanche sizes, durations, and lateral extensions. The related exponents agree well with the quenched-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang theory, which describes the front dynamics. However, the geometry of the propagating front differs slightly from that of the theoretical one. We show that this discrepancy can be understood in terms of the nonquasistatic correction induced by the finite \u2026",
