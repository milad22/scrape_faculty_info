            " The effects of lowering pH by an acidulant (citric acid) on the formation of acrylamide in fried and baked corn chips and in french fries were studied by using a GC\/MS. The 0.2% citric acid treatments induced 82.2% and 72.8% inhibition of acrylamide formation in fried and baked corn chips, respectively. Dipping potato cuts in 1% and 2% citric acid solutions for 1 h before frying showed 73.1% and 79.7% inhibition of acrylamide formation in french fries. In the experiment of heating 1 mL solution containing asparagine and glucose in phosphate buffers, by lowering the pH from 7.0 to 4.0, 99.1% inhibition of acrylamide formation was achieved. This is the first finding of an effective, simple, and practical way to limit the acrylamide formation in real foods.",

Among the herb extracts tested, 44 species showed strong antioxidant activities on the oxidation of linoleic acid. The antioxidative effects of these 44 selected herb extracts were studied further in a methyl linoleate system during storage for 35 d. Among the 44 species tested, 11 species had particularly high antioxidative effects. The effects of type of extraction solvent (methanol, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate) on the antioxidant activities of the 11 species were studied. Antioxidant activities of most herb extracts were greatly dependent on the extraction solvent used; however, some of the extracts showed strong antioxidant activities regardless of the solvents used for the extraction.

Their chemical structures were elucidated as 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols, and 6-shogaol using spectroscopic analysis. Among the five isolated compounds, 6-shogaol exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against human A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, and HCT15 tumor cells. 6-shogaol inhibited proliferation of the transgenic mouse ovarian cancer cell lines, C1 (genotype: p53-\/-, c-myc, K-ras) and C2 (genotype: p53-\/-, c-myc, Akt), with ED50 values of 0.58 \u03bcM (C1) and 10.7 \u03bcM (C2).",

Sensory evaluation and identified compounds suggest that dimethyl disulfide was mainly responsible for the light\u2010induced off\u2010flavor in skim milk. Dimethyl disulfide was formed by the singlet oxygen oxidation of methionine in milk. Gas chromatographic analysis and sensory evaluation showed that 200,500, and 1000 ppm ascorbic acid, which is a singlet oxygen quencher, lowered the formation of dimethyl disulfide and off\u2010flavor in skim milk (p<0.05).",
