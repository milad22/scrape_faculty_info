In this paper we treat a system of self-interacting bosons described by \u03bb \u03c6 4 scalar fields in flat space. We adopt the closed-time-path (CTP or \u2018\u2018in-in\u2019\u2019) functional formalism and use a two-particle irreducible (2PI) representation for the effective action. These formalisms allow for a full account of the dynamics of quantum fields, and put the correlation functions on an equal footing with the mean fields. By assuming a thermal distribution we recover the real-time finite-temperature theory as a special case. By requiring the CTP effective action to be stationary with respect to variations of the correlation functions we obtain an infinite set of coupled equations which is the quantum-field-theoretical generalization of the Bogoliubov \u2026",

This closed-time-path formalism which generalizes the conventional method based on in-out vacuum persistence amplitudes yields real and causal effective actions, field equations, and expectation values. We apply this method to two problems in semiclassical cosmology. First we study the back reaction of particle production in a radiation-filled Bianchi type-I universe with a conformal scalar field.

Observed laser performance is compared with that calculated by use of collisional and radiative coupling rates observed in nonionized gases and of electron activation and deactivation rates estimated from CO2 discharge systems.

The cosmological models studied are the Kasner-like (type I) metrics (homogeneous, spatially flat, nonrotating, but anisotropic), and also the isotropic Robertson-Walker metrics. The methods employed have previously been expounded in the context of a minimally coupled scalar field and a Robertson-Walker metric. Three divergent leading terms are extracted from an adiabatic expansion of the formal expressions for the expectation values of the energy density and pressures. In the Kasner case a slight reshuffling of the leading terms in the energy density displays all divergences to \u2026",

A suitable expectation value of the renormalized energy-momentum tensor acts as the source of the metric in the Einstein equations. The coupled set of differential equations is numerically integrated, with the help of several approximations, in the case when the quantized field is the massless conformal scalar field. Boundary conditions are imposed at an initial time t 0 of the order of the Planck time, with the initial expansion rates varying over a wide range consistent with the constraints. It is found that the expansion rates tend toward isotropy and approach a radiation-filled Friedmann expansion in an interval of less than 10 3 Planck times, for the full range of initial expansion rates considered.",

The noise kernel is the vacuum expectation value of the (operator-valued) stress-energy bitensor, which describes the fluctuations of quantum-matter fields in curved spacetimes. A new improved criterion for the validity of semiclassical gravity may also be formulated from the viewpoint of this theory. In the first part of this review we describe the fundamentals of this new theory via two approaches: the axiomatic and the functional. The axiomatic approach is useful to see the structure of the theory from the framework of semiclassical gravity, showing the link from the mean value of the stress-energy tensor to the \u2026",
