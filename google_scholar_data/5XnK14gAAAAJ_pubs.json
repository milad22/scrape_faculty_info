            "After the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, interest in nonlinear dynamics, especially deterministic chaotic dynamics, has increased in both the financial press and the academic literature. This has come about because the frequency of large moves in stock markets is greater than would be expected under a normal distribution. There are a number of possible explanations. A popular one is that the stock market is governed by chaotic dynamics. What exactly is chaos and how is it related to nonlinear dynamics? How does one detect chaos? Is there chaos in financial markets? Are there other explanations of the movements of financial prices other than chaos? The purpose of this paper is to explore these issues.",

            "Chaos theory has touched on such fields as biology, cognitive science, and physics. By providing a unified and complete explanation of new statistical methods that are useful for testing for chaos in data sets, Brock, Hsieh, and LeBaron show how the principles of chaos theory can be applied to such areas of economics and finance as the changing structure of stock returns and nonlinearity in foreign exchange. They use computer models extensively to illustrate their ideas and explain this frontier research at a level of rigor sufficient for others to build upon as well as to verify the soundness of their arguments. The authors, who have played a major role in developing basic testing methods that are effective in detecting chaos and other nonlinearities, provide a detailed exposition of empirical techniques for identifying evidence of chaos. They introduce and describe the BDS statistic, an easy-to-use test that detects the existence of potentially forecastable structure, nonstationarity, or hidden patterns in time-series data and that can be adapted to test for the adequacy of fit of forecasting models. An extensive performance evaluation of the BDS is included. Nonlinear Dynamics, Chaos, and Instability also reviews important issues in the theoretical economics literature on chaos and complex dynamics, surveys existing work on the detection of chaos and nonlinear structure, and develops models and processes to discover predictable sequencing in time-series data, such as stock returns, that currently appear random.

Instead, in an extension of previous work on asset-based style (ABS) factors, the article proposes a model of hedge fund returns that is similar to models based on arbitrage pricing theory, with dynamic risk-factor coefficients. For diversified hedge fund portfolios (as proxied by indexes of hedge funds and funds of hedge funds), the seven ABS factors can explain up to 80 percent of monthly return variations. Because ABS factors are directly observable from market prices, this model provides a standardized framework for identifying differences among major hedge fund indexes that is free of the biases inherent in hedge fund databases.

            "This article estimates autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH) and generalized ARCH (GARCH) models for five foreign currencies, using 10 years of daily data, a variety of ARCH and GARCH specifications, a number of nonnormal error densities, and a comprehensive set of diagnostic checks. It finds that ARCH and GARCH models can usually remove all heteroscedasticity in price changes in all five currencies. Goodness-of-fit diagnostics indicate that exponential GARCH with certain nonnormal distributions fits the Canadian dollar extremely well and the Swiss franc and the deutsche mark reasonably well. Only one nonnormal distribution fits the Japanese yen reasonably well. None fit the British pound.",

The risk-adjusted difference in returns between the top five percent and the bottom five percent of the NYSE firms is about one to two percent a year, a drop from about twelve percent per year before risk adjustment. The variable most responsible for the adjustment is the sensitivity of asset returns to the changing risk premium, measured by the return difference between low-grade bonds and long-term government bonds.",

The main purpose is to discriminate between two competing explanations for the observed heavy tails of the distribution: that the data are independently drawn from a heavy tail distribution which remains fixed over time, and that the data come from distributions which vary over time. Evidence point to the rejection of the first hypothesis. Further investigations show that the rejection can be attributed to changing means and variances in the data, which can be described by a simple statistical model.",
