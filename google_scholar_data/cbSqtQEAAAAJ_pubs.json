            "In an ultraclean 2D electron system (2DES) subjected to crossed millimeterwave (30\u2013150 GHz) and weak (B< 2 k G) magnetic fields, a series of apparently dissipationless states emerges as the system is detuned from cyclotron resonances. Such states are characterized by an exponentially vanishing low-temperature diagonal resistance and a classical Hall resistance. The activation energies associated with such states exceed the Landau level spacing by an order of magnitude. Our findings are likely indicative of a collective ground state previously unknown for 2DES.",

The hallmark of these phenomena is magnetoresistance oscillations generated by the external forces that drive the electron system out of equilibrium. The rich set of dramatic phenomena of this kind, discovered in high-mobility semiconductor nanostructures, includes, in particular, microwave radiation-induced resistance oscillations and zero-resistance states, as well as Hall field-induced resistance oscillations and associated zero-differential resistance states. The experimental manifestations of these phenomena and the unified theoretical framework for describing them in terms of a quantum kinetic equation are reviewed.

Appearing in a weak magnetic field (B< 0.3 T) and only in a narrow temperature range (2 K< T< 9 K), these oscillations are periodic in 1\/B with a frequency proportional to the electron Fermi wave vector, k F. We interpret the effect as a magnetophonon resonance of the 2DEG with leaky interface-acoustic phonon modes carrying a wave vector q= 2 k F. Calculations show a few branches of such modes existing on the GaAs\u2212 Al x Ga 1\u2212 x As interface, and their velocities are in quantitative agreement with the observation.",
