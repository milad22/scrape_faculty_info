To recover background pixels, we extend the image repairing method, where layer segmentation and homography blending are used to preserve temporal coherence and avoid flickering. By exploiting the constraint imposed by periodic motion and a subclass of camera and object motions, we adopt a two-phase approach to repair moving foreground pixels: In the sampling phase, motion data are sampled and regularized by 3D tensor voting to maintain temporal coherence and motion periodicity. In the alignment phase, missing moving foreground pixels are inferred by spatial and temporal alignment of the sampled motion data at multiple scales. We experimented our system with some difficult examples, where the camera can be stationary or in motion.",

Because textures are maintained in the shadowless image after the extraction process, our approach produces some of the best results to date among shadow removal techniques. Using the image formation equation typical of computer vision, we advocate a new model for shadow formation where shadow effect is understood as light attenuation instead of a mixture of two colors governed by the conventional matting equation. This leads to a new shadow equation with fewer unknowns to solve, where a three-channel shadow matte and a shadowless image are considered in our optimization. Our problem is formulated as one of energy minimization guided by user-supplied hints in the form of a quadmap which can be specified easily by the user. This formulation allows for robust shadow \u2026",

Our system employs user-assisted video layer segmentation, while the main processing in video repair is fully automatic. The input video is first decomposed into the color and illumination videos. The necessary temporal consistency is maintained by tensor voting in the spatio-temporal domain. Missing colors and illumination of the background are synthesized by applying image repairing. Finally, the occluded motions are inferred by spatio-temporal alignment of collected samples at multiple scales.

No simplifying assumption on the camera and the light source other than the Lambertian assumption is used. Our method is unique because it is capable of translating very rough user-supplied hints into the effective likelihood and prior functions for our Bayesian optimization. The likelihood function requires a decent estimation of the shadowless image, which is obtained by solving the associated Poisson equation. Our Bayesian framework allows for the optimal extraction of smooth shadows while preserving texture appearance under the extracted shadow. Thus our technique can be applied to shadow removal, producing some best results to date compared with the current state-of-the-art techniques using a single input image.

First, we introduce a novel shape-from-shading algorithm (SfS) that produces faithful normal reconstruction for local image region (high-frequency component), but it fails to faithfully recover the overall global structure (low-frequency component). Our second contribution consists of an approach that corrects low-frequency error using a simple markup procedure. This approach, aptly called rotation palette, allows the user to specify large scale corrections of surface normals by drawing simple stroke correspondences between the normal map and a sphere image which represents rotation directions. Combining these two approaches, we can produce high-quality surfaces quickly from single images.",

The 3D orientation from the shape palette is transferred to the 2D primitive based on the markup. As we will demonstrate, only sparse markup is needed to generate expressive and detailed 3D surfaces.

In this paper, we present a method which does not enforce discrete integrability and reconstructs a 3D continuous surface from a gradient or a height field, or a combination of both, which can be dense or sparse. The key to our approach is the use of kernel basis functions, which transfer the continuous surface reconstruction problem into high-dimensional space, where a closed-form solution exists.
