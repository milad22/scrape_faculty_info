            "We report on the coherent optical excitation of electron spin polarization in the ground state of charged GaAs quantum dots via an intermediate charged exciton (trion) state. Coherent optical fields are used for the creation and detection of the Raman spin coherence between the spin ground states of the charged quantum dot. The measured spin decoherence time, which is likely limited by the nature of the spin ensemble, approaches 10 ns at zero field. We also show that the Raman spin coherence in the quantum beats is caused not only by the usual stimulated Raman interaction but also by simultaneous spontaneous radiative decay of either excited trion state to a coherent combination of the two spin states.",

Electron spins in quantum dots are particularly attractive for implementations of qubits, and efficient optical methods for initialization and readout of spins have been developed in recent years 3, 4. Spin coherence times in the microsecond range have been demonstrated 5. Therefore, spin control by picosecond optical pulses would be highly desirable so that a large number of spin rotations could be carried out while coherence is maintained. A major remaining challenge is demonstration of such rotations with high fidelity. Here, we use an ensemble of quantum-dot electron spins focused into a small number of precession modes about a magnetic field by periodic optical pumping.

Photonic crystal architectures are promising platforms for enhancing the coupling of light to solid-state qubits. Quantum dots can be integrated into a photonic crystal, with optical transitions coupling to photons and spin states forming a long-lived quantum memory. Many researchers have now succeeded in coupling these emitters to photonic crystal cavities, but there have been no demonstrations of a functional spin qubit and quantum gates in this environment. Here, we have developed a coupled cavity\u2013quantum dot system in which the dot is controllably charged with a single electron.

In particular, we make use of the analytic properties of sech pulses in two-level systems to realize spin rotations about the growth direction by an arbitrary angle, for which we give an analytical expression. We propose to use this scheme to experimentally demonstrate this spin rotation. Using realistic system and pulse parameters we find the fidelity of the rotation to be more than 96% for pulses in the picosecond regime, and robust against small errors in pulse parameters. We design a feedback (adaptive) loop to correct for errors originating from unintended dynamics.

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy.
