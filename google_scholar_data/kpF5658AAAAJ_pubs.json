            "This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg 2 of imaging data, with most of the~ 2000 deg 2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120 long, 2 fdg 5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg 2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg 2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was \u2026",

            "We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the \u2026",

These numbers represent a roughly 27% increment over those of the Third Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. The Fourth Data Release also includes an additional 131,840 spectra of objects selected using a variety of alternative algorithms, to address scientific issues ranging from the kinematics of stars in the Milky Way thick disk to populations of faint galaxies and quasars.",

The imaging data reach a depth of r\u2248 22.2 (95% completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread function magnitudes for point \u2026",

Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin\u00b12 spherical harmonics. These are the analogues of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin\u00b12 multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receive contributions from scalar modes and does not cross correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit expressions \u2026",
