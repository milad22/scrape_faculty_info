            "We use ATLAS and CMS searches in the monojet+ missing energy and monophoton+ missing energy final state to set limits on the couplings of dark matter to quarks and gluons. Working in an effective field theory framework we compare several existing monojet analyses and find that searches with high p T cuts are more sensitive to dark matter. We constrain the suppression scale of the effective dark matter\u2013standard model interactions and convert these limits into bounds on the cross sections relevant to direct and indirect detection. We find that, for certain types of operators, in particular, spin-independent dark matter\u2013gluon couplings and spin-dependent dark matter\u2013quark couplings, LHC constraints from the monojet channel are competitive with, or superior to, limits from direct searches up to dark matter masses of order 1 TeV. Comparing to indirect searches, we exclude, at 90% CL, dark matter annihilating to \u2026",

We use LEP data on monophoton events with large missing energy to constrain the coupling of dark matter to electrons. Within a large class of models, our limits are complementary to and competitive with limits on dark matter annihilation and on WIMP-nucleon scattering from indirect and direct searches. Our limits, however, do not suffer from systematic and astrophysical uncertainties associated with direct and indirect limits. For example, we are able to rule out light (\u2272 10 GeV) thermal relic dark matter with universal couplings exclusively to charged leptons. In addition, for dark matter mass below about 80 GeV, LEP limits are stronger than Fermi constraints on annihilation into charged leptons in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Within its kinematic \u2026",

LLPs are a common prediction of a wide range of theories that address unsolved fundamental mysteries such as naturalness, dark matter, baryogenesis and neutrino masses, and represent a natural and generic possibility for physics beyond the SM (BSM). In most cases the LLP lifetime can be treated as a free parameter from the m scale up to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limit of m. Neutral LLPs with lifetimes above 100 m are particularly difficult to probe, as the sensitivity of the LHC main detectors is limited by challenging backgrounds, triggers, and small acceptances.

The growth of density perturbations in the subdominant component is inhibited by dark acoustic oscillations due to its coupling to the dark radiation, solving the \u03c3 8 problem, while the presence of tightly coupled dark radiation ameliorates the H 0 problem.

            "We calculate contributions to the photon and gluon magnetic dipole operators that mediate b\u2192 s\u03b3 and b\u2192 d\u03b3 transitions in the Randall-Sundrum model of a warped extra dimension with anarchic bulk fermions and a brane localized Higgs. Unlike the Standard Model, there are large contributions to the left-handed b quark decays, parameterized by the Wilson coefficient, due to the pattern of bulk fermion localization, and sizable contributions from the gluonic penguins,, through renormalization group mixing. Further, unlike the Randall-Sundrum result for \u03bc\u2192 e\u03b3, the unprimed Wilson coefficients receive non-negligible contributions from the misalignment of the bulk fermion spectrum with the Standard Model flavor sector. We compare the size of effects and the constraints imposed by the branching ratios Br (B\u2192 X s\u03b3) and B\u2192 X d\u03b3)> within the minimal and the custodial model. Within the custodial framework, we study \u2026",
