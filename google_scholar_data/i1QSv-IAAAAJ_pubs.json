It includes 11,663 deg 2 of imaging data, with most of the~ 2000 deg 2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120 long, 2 fdg 5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg 2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg 2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was \u2026",

In addition to \u201cstandard\u201d SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy \u2026",

The survey will begin in the fall of 2012, and will run for at least four years. The telescope's design constrains the optimal declination range for observations to 10< \u03b4< 50, and site conditions lead to an emphasis on stars in the direction of the Galactic anticenter.

The 8889 stars are selected from the ongoing SUPERBLINK survey of stars with proper motion \u03bc> 40 mas yr\u20131, supplemented on the bright end with the Tycho-2 catalog. Completeness tests which account for kinematic (proper motion) bias suggest that our catalog represents\u2248 75% of the estimated~ 11, 900 M dwarfs with J< 10 expected to populate the entire sky. Our catalog is, however, significantly more complete for the northern sky (\u2248 90%) than it is for the south (\u2248 60%). Stars are identified as cool, red M dwarfs from a combination of optical and infrared color cuts, and are distinguished from background M giants and highly reddened stars using either existing parallax measurements or, if such measurements are lacking, using their location in an optical-to-infrared reduced proper motion diagram. These bright M dwarfs are \u2026",

            "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be conducting a nearly all-sky photometric survey over two years, with a core mission goal to discover small transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars. It will obtain 30 minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with two-minute cadence observations of 200,000\u2013400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the two-minute cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL \u2026",

These reveal stochastic variable substructures in the line, which tend to move away from the line center with time. Similar scaled-up features are well established in the strong winds of Wolf-Rayet stars (the presumed descendants of O stars), where they are explained by outward-moving inhomogeneities (eg, blobs, clumps, and shocks) in the winds. If all hot star winds are clumped like that of \u03b6 Pup, as is plausible, then mass loss rates based on recombination-line intensities will have to be revised downward. Using a standard\" \u03b2\" velocity law, we deduce a value of \u03b2= 1.0-1.2 to account for the kinematics of these structures in the wind of \u03b6 Pup. In addition to the small-scale stochastic variations, we also find a slow systematic variation of the mean \u2026",

The LPVs are shown to present systematic patterns: they all consist of a number of relatively narrow emission subpeaks that tend to move from the line centers toward the line edges. We introduce a phenomenological model that depicts WR winds as being made up of a large number of randomly distributed, radially propagating, discrete wind emission elements (DWEEs). This working model is used to simulate LPV patterns in emission lines from a clumped wind. General properties of the LPV patterns are analyzed with the help of novel numerical \u2026",
