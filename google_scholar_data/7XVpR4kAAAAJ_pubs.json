This is a great pity, because [...] it is the need to engage in dialogue, and to make things logical and clear, that is the primary defence against obscurantism and abstraction.\u201d",

            "As time passes, once simple quantum states tend to become more complex. For strongly coupled k-local Hamiltonians, this growth of computational complexity has been conjectured to follow a distinctive and universal pattern. In this paper we show that the same pattern is exhibited by a much simpler system\u2014classical geodesics on a compact two-dimensional geometry of uniform negative curvature. This striking parallel persists whether the system is allowed to evolve naturally or is perturbed from the outside.",
