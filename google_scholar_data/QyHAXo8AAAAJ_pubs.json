            "The Einstein equation is derived from the proportionality of entropy and the horizon area together with the fundamental relation \u03b4 Q= T dS. The key idea is to demand that this relation hold for all the local Rindler causal horizons through each spacetime point, with \u03b4 Q and T interpreted as the energy flux and Unruh temperature seen by an accelerated observer just inside the horizon. This requires that gravitational lensing by matter energy distorts the causal structure of spacetime so that the Einstein equation holds.

The techniques are Wald\u2019s Noether charge approach introduced recently, and a field redefinition method developed in this paper. Wald\u2019s results are extended by establishing that his local geometric expression for the black hole entropy gives the same result when evaluated on an arbitrary cross section of a Killing horizon (rather than just the bifurcation surface). Further, we show that his expression for the entropy is not affected by ambiguities which arise in the Noether construction. Using the Noether charge expression, the entropy is evaluated explicitly for black holes in a wide class of generally covariant theories. For a Lagrangian of the functional form L\u0303= L\u0303 (\u03c8 m,\u2207 a \u03c8 m, g a b, R a b c d,\u2207 e R a b c d), it is found that the entropy is given by S=-2\u03c0\u222e(Y a b c d-\u2207 e Z e \u2026",

We discuss some of the current observational bounds on LV, focusing mostly on those from high energy astrophysics in the QED sector at order E\/MPlanck.

The question\" would a black hole radiate if there were a Planck scale cutoff in the rest frame of the hole?\" is posed. Guidance is sought from Unruh's fluid-flow analogue of black-hole radiation, by taking into account the atomic nature of the fluid. Two arguments for black-hole radiation are given which assume a Planck length cutoff. One involves the response of static accelerated detectors outside the horizon, and the other involves conservation of the expectation value of the stress tensor. Neither argument is conclusive, but they do strongly suggest that, in spite of reasonable doubt about the usual derivations of black-hole radiation, a\" safe\" derivation which avoids our ignorance of ultrashort-distance physics can likely be formulated.

            "We study the spectrum of created particles in two-dimensional black hole geometries for a linear, Hermitian scalar field satisfying a Lorentz noninvariant field equation with higher spatial derivative terms that are suppressed by powers of a fundamental momentum scale k 0. The preferred frame is the\" free-fall frame\" of the black hole. This model is a variation of Unruh's sonic black hole analogy. We find that there are two qualitatively different types of particle production in this model: a thermal Hawking flux generated by\" mode conversion\" at the black hole horizon, and a nonthermal spectrum generated via scattering off the background into negative free-fall frequency modes. This second process has nothing to do with black holes and does not occur for the ordinary wave equation because such modes do not propagate outside the horizon with positive Killing frequency. The horizon component of the radiation is \u2026",
