To this end we perform a discretized light-cone quantization of large-N gauge theory in 1+ 1 dimensions, with scalar or fermionic matter fields transforming in the adjoint representation of SU (N). The entire spectrum consists of bosonic and fermionic closed-string excitations, which are free as N\u2192\u221e. We analyze the general features of such states as a function of the cutoff and the gauge coupling, obtaining good convergence for the case of adjoint fermions. We discuss possible extensions of the model and the search for new noncritical string theories.",

A large-N c approximation is made and the light-cone Hamiltonian expanded in massive dynamical fields at fixed lattice spacing. In contrast with earlier calculations, we include contributions from states containing many gluonic link fields between the quarks. The Hamiltonian is renormalized by a combination of covariance conditions on bound states and fitting the physical masses M \u03c1 and M \u03c0, decay constant f \u03c0, and the string tension \u03c3. Good covariance is obtained for the lightest 0\u2212+ state, which we compare with the pion. Many observables can be deduced from its light-cone wave functions. After perturbative evolution, the quark valence structure function is found to be consistent with the experimental pion structure function deduced from \u2026",

Physical gauge degrees of freedom are represented by disordered flux fields on the links of the lattice. A renormalised light-cone Hamiltonian is obtained by making a colour-dielectric expansion for the link-field interactions. Parameters in the Hamiltonian are renormalised non-perturbatively by seeking regions in parameter space with enhanced Lorentz symmetry. In the case of pure gauge theories to lowest non-trivial order of the colour-dielectric expansion, this is sufficient to determine accurately all parameters in the large-N limit. We summarize results from applications to glueballs. After quarks are added, the Hamiltonian and Hilbert space are expanded in both dynamical fermion and link fields.

We find 0++, 2++, and 1+\u2212 glueballs having masses consistent with N c= 3 data available from Euclidean lattice path integral methods. The wave functions exhibit a light-front constituent gluon structure.",
