            "From cell phones to biomedical systems, modern life is inexorably dependent on the complex convergence of technologies into stand-alone products designed to provide a complete solution in small, highly integrated systems with computing, communication, biomedical and consumer functions. The concept of system-on-package (SOP) originated in the mid-1990s at the NSF-funded Packaging Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This can be thought of as a conceptual paradigm in which the package, and not the bulky board, as the system and the package provides all the system functions in one single module, not as an assemblage of discrete components to be connected together, but as a continuous merging of various integrated thin film technologies in a small package. In the SOP concept, this is accomplished by codesign and fabrication of digital, optical, RF and sensor functions in both IC \u2026",

            "In this paper, we demonstrate compatibility of hybrid, large-scale integration of both active and passive devices and components onto standard printed wiring boards in order to address mixed signal system-on-package (SOP)-based systems and applications. Fabrication, integration and characterization of high density passive components are presented, which includes the first time fabrication on FR-4 boards of a polymer buffer layer with nano scale local smoothness, blazed polymer surface relief gratings recorded by incoherent illumination, arrays of polymer micro lenses, and embedded bare die commercial p-i-n photodetectors. These embedded optical components are the essential building blocks toward a highly integrated SOP technology. The effort in this research demonstrates the potential for merging high-performance optical functions with traditional digital and radio frequency (RF) electronics onto large \u2026",

A new spectrum of opportunities and challenges arises for integrated system designers, which warrants rethinking and innovations from system design perspectives. By selecting three representative cases, i.e., solid-state data storage, power delivery, and hybrid radio-frequency\/optical transceiver for distributed sensor networks, this paper intends to exemplify the potentials of exploiting the benefits of 3-D integration technology from system perspectives.",
