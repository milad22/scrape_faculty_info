Deformations of the Lie algebra of C\u221e functions, defined by the Poisson bracket, generalize the well-known Moyal bracket. Deformations of the algebra of C\u221e functions, defined by ordinary multiplication, give rise to noncommutative, associative algebras, isomorphic to the operator algebras of quantum theory. In particular, we study deformations invariant under any Lie algebra of \u201cdistinguished observables\u201d, thus generalizing the usual quantization scheme based on the Heisenberg algebra.",

Although the manifold admits groups of motion isomorphic to the real 3-dimensional rotation group and the one-dimensional translation group, it is impossible to introduce a global time-coordinate in such a way that the latter is realized as translations in time.

Therefore, in de Sitter space, every state of a free, \u2018massless\u2019 particle may be interpreted as a state of two free singletons \u2014 and vice versa. The term \u2018massless\u2019 is associated with a set of particle-like representations of SO(3, 2) that, besides the noted conformal extension, exhibit other phenomena typical of masslessness, especially gauge invariance.",
