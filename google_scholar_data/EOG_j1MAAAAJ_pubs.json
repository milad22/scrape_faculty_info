            "We have studied temperature dependences of electron transport in graphene and its bilayer and found extremely low electron-phonon scattering rates that set the fundamental limit on possible charge carrier mobilities at room temperature. Our measurements show that mobilities higher than 200 000 cm 2\/V s are achievable, if extrinsic disorder is eliminated. A sharp (thresholdlike) increase in resistivity observed above\u223c 200 K is unexpected but can qualitatively be understood within a model of a rippled graphene sheet in which scattering occurs on intraripple flexural phonons.",

QH plateaus at filling factors \u03bd= 0,\u00b11,\u00b14 are discovered at magnetic fields B> 20 T, indicating the lifting of the fourfold degeneracy of the previously observed QH states at \u03bd=\u00b14 (| n|+ 1\/2), where n is the Landau-level index. In particular, the presence of the \u03bd= 0,\u00b11 QH plateaus indicates that the Landau level at the charge neutral Dirac point splits into four sublevels, lifting sublattice and spin degeneracy. The QH effect at \u03bd=\u00b14 is investigated in a tilted magnetic field and can be attributed to lifting of the spin degeneracy of the n= 1 Landau level.",

Even though the potential applications of cone arrays as electron emitters and other devices are very promising, understanding of their structure and formation mechanisms is still very limited compared to nanotubes and other carbon structures. Moreover, the cones have only been synthesized in a mixture with other shapes, but never as continuous arrays. It appears, however, that we can learn from nature how to produce large carbon cone arrays. We here report the first-known natural occurrence of large arrays of conical graphite crystals. These occur on the surfaces of millimeter-sized polycrystalline spheroidal aggregates of graphite. Cone heights range from less then a micron to 40 \u03bcm, which is larger than any other carbon cones reported in the literature. They are also observed to dominate sample surfaces. The \u2026",

Incorporation of the actual diamond-cubic crystal structure allows for the inclusion of possible effects of the structure's rotational symmetry, coordination and the layer-stacking periodicity (normal to the surface) on the surface properties and dynamics. Results of extensive equilibrium simulations, including surface energies, surface specific heats, step energies and surface roughness, are presented to characterize the basic model. A broad peak in the surface specific heat and the universal behavior of the height-difference correlation function indicate a roughening transition at temperature TR. A preroughening transition is indicated by a sharp peak in the surface specific heat and a dramatic decrease in the step \u2026",
