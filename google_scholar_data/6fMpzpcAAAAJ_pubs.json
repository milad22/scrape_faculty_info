Such systems may find technological applications that range from graphene synthesis, to condensation heat transfer, to electrical contacts to graphene, to composites. Using density functional theory, we have calculated surface energies of the three low-index faces of bulk Cu. We find that these surface energies, calculated with the PBEsol functional, are significantly higher than with the more common PBE functional and agree more closely with experiment. We have also calculated the surface energies of graphene and graphite, the exfoliation energy between graphene and graphite, and the adhesion energies between graphene or graphite and a Cu(111) slab. The adhesion energy between a carbon layer and Cu(111) is close to the exfoliation energy and cleavage energy of graphite, the four sets \u2026",

Individual NCs can have far-from-equilibrium shapes and composition profiles. The free energy of NC ensembles is lowered by coarsening which can involve Ostwald ripening or Smoluchowski ripening (NC diffusion and coalescence). Preservation of individual NC structure and inhibition of coarsening are key, e.g., for avoiding catalyst degradation. This review focuses on postsynthesis evolution of metallic NCs. Atomistic-level modeling typically utilizes stochastic lattice-gas models to access appropriate time and length scales. However, predictive modeling requires incorporation of realistic rates for relaxation mechanisms, e.g., periphery diffusion and intermixing, in numerous local environments \u2026",

Necessary conditions for encapsulation are preexisting ion-induced defects in the graphite substrate and elevated deposition temperature of 875\u2013900\u2009K. Evidence of encapsulation consists of atomically resolved STM images of a carbon lattice, both on top of the islands and on the sloping sides.

We find that large facetted clusters grow at elevated temperatures, using high Cu exposures. The cluster size distribution is bimodal, and under some conditions, large clusters are surrounded by a denuded zone. We propose that defect-mediated nucleation, and coarsening during deposition, are both operative in this system. At 780 K, a surprising type of facetted cluster emerges, and at 900 K this type predominates: pyramidal clusters with a triangular base, exposing (311) planes as side facets.
