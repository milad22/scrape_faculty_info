Beyond solely diagnostic applications, CTCs are also a subject of interest for drug development and cancer research. In this paper, we adapt a technology previously introduced, combining the use of micro-scale vortices and inertial focusing, specifically for the high-purity extraction of CTCs from blood samples. First, we systematically varied parameters including channel dimensions and flow rates to arrive at an optimal device for maximum trapping efficiency and purity. Second, we \u2026",

            "Objectives. This study sought to determine whether early disease is identifiable in asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by means of noninvasive cardiologic assessment. Background. DCM is diagnosed on the basis of advanced heart failure, where cardiac dilation and impaired contractility are recognized in the absence of a recognized etiology (World Health Organization criteria). However, initial clinical presentation may be with severe complications: thromboembolism, arrhythmia or sudden death. DCM has recently been recognized to be familial, with autosomal dominant inheritance in many cases. Familial disease is present in 9% to 20% of patients with DCM, and the ability to identify early disease in such people may improve patient management and aid in the understanding of pathogenesis. Method. We prospectively assessed 408 asymptomatic relatives (mean [\u00b1SD] age 35 \u2026",

Data on QT disper sion in patients with congestive heart failure are scarce. In this study, conventional 12-lead ECGs were recorded in 135 consecutive patients with congestive heart failure secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Seventy-five patients were excluded from QT interval assessments due to one or more of the following reasons: (1) low amplitude of the T wave (n=3), (2) atrial fibrillation (n=26) and (3) bundle branch block (n=46). QT dispersion was calculated as (I) QT-range: the difference between the maximum and minimum QT intervals on any of the 12 leads and (2) QT-SD: the standard deviation of the QT interval in all the 12 leads. RR intervals were measured in leads II, aVL, V2 and V5 QT-SD (20\u00b785 \u00b1 5\u00b700 ms) was significantly (r=0 \u2026",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Time domain analysis of 24 hour HRV was performed in 64 patients with DCM, 19 of their relatives with left ventricular enlargement (possible early DCM), and 33 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Measures of HRV were reduced in patients with DCM compared with controls (P < 0.05). HRV parameters were similar in relatives and controls. Measures of HRV were lower in DCM patients in whom progressive heart failure developed (n = 28) than in those who remained clinically stable (n = 36) during a follow up of 24 (20) months (P = 0.0001). Reduced HRV was associated with NYHA functional class, left ventricular end diastolic dimension, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and peak exercise oxygen consumption (P < 0.05) in all patients.

            "To assess the frequency of circulating cardiac specific autoantibodies in HIV positive patients with and without echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction.74 HIV positive patients including 28 with echocardiographic evidence of heart muscle disease, 52 HIV negative people at low risk of HIV infection, and 14 HIV negative drug users who had all undergone non-invasive cardiac assessment were studied along with a group of 200 healthy blood donors.Cardiac autoantibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence (serum dilution 1\/10) were more common in the HIV positive patients (15%), particularly the HIV heart muscle disease group (21%), than in HIV negative controls (3.5%) (both\u2009p\u2009<\u20090.001). By elisa (dilution 1\/320), abnormal anti-\u03b1 myosin autoantibody concentrations were found more often in HIV patients with heart muscle disease (43%) than in HIV positive \u2026",

            "Myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy may be phases of an organ-specific autoimmune disease of the myocardium. To provide evidence for autoimmune involvement in myocarditis, cardiac autoantibodies were detected in patient sera from the Myocarditis Treatment Trial.Cardiac antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence and by anti-\u03b1-myosin enzyme-linked inimunosorbent assay in 53 patients from the Myocarditis Treatment Trial (35 males, aged 42\u00b115 years); all had clinical myocarditis, but only 24 were classified as having histological myocarditis (Dallas criteria). By immunofluorescence, cardiac antibodies were more common in myocarditis (13\/53) than in ischaemic (11\/186, P=0\u00b70001) or in normal controls (24\/270, P=0\u00b7001). Abnormally raised anti-\u03b1-myosin antibodies were also more frequent in myocarditis (9\/53) than in \u2026",
