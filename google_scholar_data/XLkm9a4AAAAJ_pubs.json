            "The effort to develop earth\u2010abundant kesterite solar cells has led to an approximate doubling of the power conversion efficiency over the past five years to 12.6%, primarily due to increases in short\u2010circuit current and fill factor; open\u2010circuit voltage has resisted similar change, limiting further efficiency improvement. In the present investigation, Auger nanoprobe spectroscopy, X\u2010ray\/ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and device characterization are used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of grain boundaries and interfaces in limiting performance in kesterite\u2010based devices. High photovoltaic performance is found to correlate with grain boundaries that are Cu\u2010depleted and enriched with SnOx. The formation of this bulk\u2010like oxide at grain boundaries with type I band offset provides a unique effective passivation that limits electron\u2010hole recombination. Building on these new insights, photovoltaic \u2026",

            "The kesterite material Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) is an attractive earth\u2010abundant semiconductor for photovoltaics. However, the power conversion efficiency is limited by a large density of I\u2013II antisite defects, which cause severe band tailing and open\u2010circuit voltage loss. Ag2ZnSnSe4 (AZTSe) is a promising alternative to CZTSSe with a substantially lower I\u2013II antisite defect density and smaller band tailing. AZTSe is weakly n\u2010type, and this study reports for the first time on how the carrier density is impacted by stoichiometry. This study presents the first\u2010ever photovoltaic device based on AZTSe, which exhibits an efficiency of 5.2%, which is the highest value reported for an n\u2010type thin\u2010film absorber. Due to the weakly n\u2010type nature of the absorber, a new architecture is employed (SnO:F\/AZTSe\/MoO3\/ITO) to replace conventional contacts and buffer materials. Using this platform, it is shown that the band tailing \u2026",

            "The growth in efficiency of earth-abundant kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells has slowed, due in part to the intrinsic limitations imposed by the band tailing attributed primarily to I-II antisite exchange. In this study, density functional theory simulations show that when Ag is substituted for Cu to form kesterite Ag2ZnSnSe4 (AZTSe), the I-II isolated antisite formation energy becomes 3.7 times greater than in CZTSSe, resulting in at least an order of magnitude reduction in I-II antisite density. Experimental evidence of an optoelectronically improved material is also provided. Comparison of the low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) structure of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe), CZTSSe, and AZTSe shows that AZTSe has a shallow defect structure with emission significantly closer to the band edge than CZTSe. Existence of suppressed band tailing is found in the proximity of the room-temperature PL peak of AZTSe to \u2026",
