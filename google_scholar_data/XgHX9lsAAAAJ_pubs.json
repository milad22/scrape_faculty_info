The room temperature values of the thermal conductivity in the range \u223c(4.84 \u00b1 0.44) \u00d7 103 to (5.30 \u00b1 0.48) \u00d7 103 W\/mK were extracted for a single-layer graphene from the dependence of the Raman G peak frequency on the excitation laser power and independently measured G peak temperature coefficient. The extremely high value of the thermal conductivity suggests that graphene can outperform carbon nanotubes in heat conduction. The superb thermal conduction property of graphene is beneficial for the proposed electronic applications and establishes graphene as an excellent material for thermal management.",

Rapid progress in plasmonics has largely relied on advances in device nano-fabrication 5, 6, 7, whereas less attention has been paid to the tunable properties of plasmonic media. One such medium\u2014graphene\u2014is amenable to convenient tuning of its electronic and optical properties by varying the applied voltage 8, 9, 10, 11. Here, using infrared nano-imaging, we show that common graphene\/SiO 2\/Si back-gated structures support propagating surface plasmons. The wavelength of graphene plasmons is of the order of 200 nanometres at technologically relevant infrared frequencies, and they can propagate several times this distance. We have succeeded in altering both the amplitude and the wavelength of these plasmons by \u2026",

Ripples are an intrinsic feature of graphene sheets 6 and are expected to strongly influence electronic properties by inducing effective magnetic fields and changing local potentials 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The ability to control ripple structure in graphene could allow device design based on local strain 13 and selective bandgap engineering 14. Here, we report the first direct observation and controlled creation of one-and two-dimensional periodic ripples in suspended graphene sheets, using both spontaneously and thermally generated strains. We are able to control ripple orientation, wavelength and amplitude by controlling boundary conditions and making use of graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), which we measure to be much larger than that of graphite.

The fact that the thermal conductivity of large enough graphene sheets should be higher than that of basal planes of bulk graphite was predicted theoretically by Klemens 7. However, the exact mechanisms behind the drastic alteration of a material\u2019s intrinsic ability to conduct heat as its dimensionality changes from two to three dimensions remain elusive. The recent availability of high-quality few-layer graphene (FLG) materials allowed us to study dimensional crossover experimentally. Here we show that the room-temperature thermal conductivity changes from\u223c 2,800 to\u223c 1,300 W m\u2212 1 K\u2212 1 as the number of atomic planes in FLG increases from 2 to 4.

            "As an emergent electronic material and model system for condensed-matter physics, graphene and its electrical transport properties have become a subject of intense focus. By performing low-temperature transport spectroscopy on single-layer and bilayer graphene, we observe ballistic propagation and quantum interference of multiply reflected waves of charges from normal electrodes and multiple Andreev reflections from superconducting electrodes, thereby realizing quantum billiards in which scattering only occurs at the boundaries. In contrast to the conductivity of conventional two-dimensional materials, graphene9s conductivity at the Dirac point is geometry-dependent because of conduction via evanescent modes, approaching the theoretical value 4e2\/\u03c0h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck9s constant) only for short and wide devices. These distinctive transport properties have important \u2026",
