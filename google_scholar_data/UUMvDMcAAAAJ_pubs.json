A strong dependence of orientation, crystallite size, and electrical resistivity upon the substrate-induced strain along the c axis has been found. The results of structural and morphological studies indicate that relatively larger tensile strain exists in ZnO deposited on sapphire and glass, while a smaller compressive strain appears in film deposited on GaN and the strain is relaxed in larger crystallite size. The electrical resistivity of the films increases exponentially with increasing strain. The excitonic peak positions are found to shift slightly towards lower energy side with increasing strain.

XRD results show that the annealed ZnO films with wurtzite structure are randomly oriented. Crystallite size, carrier concentration, resistivity and mobility are found to be dependent on the annealing temperature. The change in carrier concentration is discussed with respect to the removal of adsorbed oxygen from the grain boundaries. The highest carrier concentration and lowest resistivity are 8 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123 and 2.25 \u00d7 10\u22121 \u03a9 cm, respectively, for the film annealed at 500 \u00b0C in vacuum. The annealed films are highly transparent with average transmission exceeding 80% in the wavelength region of 400\u2013800 nm.
