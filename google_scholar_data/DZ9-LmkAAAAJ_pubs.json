            "How do neuronal populations in the auditory cortex represent acoustic stimuli? Although sound-evoked neural responses in the anesthetized auditory cortex are mainly transient, recent experiments in the unanesthetized preparation have emphasized subpopulations with other response properties. To quantify the relative contributions of these different subpopulations in the awake preparation, we have estimated the representation of sounds across the neuronal population using a representative ensemble of stimuli. We used cell-attached recording with a glass electrode, a method for which single-unit isolation does not depend on neuronal activity, to quantify the fraction of neurons engaged by acoustic stimuli (tones, frequency modulated sweeps, white-noise bursts, and natural stimuli) in the primary auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. We find that the population response is sparse, with stimuli typically eliciting high firing rates (>20 spikes\/second) in less than 5% of neurons at any instant. Some neurons had very low spontaneous firing rates (<0.01 spikes\/second). At the other extreme, some neurons had driven rates in excess of 50 spikes\/second. Interestingly, the overall population response was well described by a lognormal distribution, rather than the exponential distribution that is often reported. Our results represent, to our knowledge, the first quantitative evidence for sparse representations of sounds in the unanesthetized auditory cortex. Our results are compatible with a model in which most neurons are silent much of the time, and in which representations are composed of small dynamic subsets of highly active neurons.",

However, much of the experimental evidence supporting this view  was obtained in the visual cortex. We have, therefore, assessed trial-to-trial  variability in the auditory cortex of the rat. To ensure single-unit  isolation, we used cell-attached recording. Tone-evoked responses were usually  transient, often consisting of, on average, only a single spike per stimulus.  Surprisingly, the majority of responses were not just transient, but were also  binary, consisting of 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to  each stimulus; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on  100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count.

We have developed a biophysically motivated spiking network, relying solely on synaptically local information, that can predict the full diversity of V1 simple cell receptive field shapes when trained on natural images. This represents the first demonstration that sparse coding principles, operating within the constraints imposed by cortical architecture, can successfully reproduce these receptive fields. We further prove, mathematically, that sparseness and decorrelation are the key ingredients that allow for synaptically local plasticity rules to optimize a cooperative, linear generative image model formed by the neural representation. Finally, we discuss several interesting emergent properties of our network, with the intent of bridging the gap between theoretical and experimental studies of visual cortex.",

A recurring question regards the amount of information conveyed by a specific neuronal response. Here we show that the commonly used definition for this quantity has a serious flaw: the information accumulated during subsequent observations of neural activity fails to combine additively. Additivity is a highly desirable property, both on theoretical grounds and for the practical purpose of analysing population codes. We propose an alternative measure for the information per observation and prove that this is the only definition that satisfies additivity. The old and the new definitions measure very different aspects of the neural code, which is illustrated with visual responses from a motion-sensitive neuron in the primate cortex.

By analyzing the subthreshold membrane potential dynamics on single trials, we made inferences about the underlying population activity.

This maximization process requires neural adaptation to not only the d.c. signal level, as in conventional light and dark adaptation (for example), but also to the statistical structure of the signal and noise distributions. Interestingly, if we fix the threshold level, we can observe a peak in the transmitted information at a finite value of the input signal-to-noise ratio.

We used chronically implanted microelectrode pairs to stimulateneurons in the rat auditory cortex directly. Here we demonstrate that rats canexploit differences in the timing of cortical activity as short as three milliseconds toguide decisions.",
