A cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope was used to spatially resolve the electronic properties of individual magnetic atoms displaying the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic measurements performed on individual cobalt atoms on the surface of gold show an energetically narrow feature that is identified as the Kondo resonance\u2014the predicted response of a Kondo impurity. Unexpected structure in the Kondo resonance is shown to arise from quantum mechanical interference between the d orbital and conduction electron channels for an electron tunneling into a magnetic atom in a metallic host.",

Although crystals of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors are not granular in a structural sense, theory suggests that at low levels of hole doping the holes can become concentrated at certain locations resulting in hole-rich superconducting domains 2, 3, 4, 5. Granular superconductivity arising from tunnelling between such domains would represent a new view of the underdoped copper oxide superconductors.

By contrast, in some unconventional macroscopic quantum systems (such as superfluid 3 He and superconducting UGe 2), the superconductivity (or superfluidity) is actually mediated by magnetic interactions. A magnetic mechanism has also been proposed for high-temperature superconductivity 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Within this context, the fact that magnetic Ni impurity atoms have a weaker effect on superconductivity than non-magnetic Zn atoms in the high-T c superconductors has been put forward as evidence supporting a magnetic mechanism 5, 6. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to determine directly the influence of individual Ni atoms on the local electronic structure of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4.

We find that the long-range herringbone reconstruction on Au (111) acts as a superlattice for surface-state electrons, creating a new band structure and modulated electronic density. Low energy electrons respond to the superlattice by localizing in the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) region of the reconstruction, while higher energy electrons reverse this trend, shifting density back to the adjacent face-centered-cubic (fcc) region. These observations are quantitatively explained by an extended Kronig-Penney model, from which we estimate the well-depth of the reconstruction-induced surface superlattice.",

The line shape of the Fermi-energy resonance, identified as a Kondo resonance, is observed to vary with lateral position from the impurity center and with impurity binding position on the reconstructed Au (111) surface. Little vertical dependence is seen in the resonance line shape for positions above the center of the impurity.

            "We study interference patterns of a magnetically doped topological insulator Bi 2\u2212 x Fe x Te 3+ d by using Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy and observe several new scattering channels. A comparison with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy allows us to unambiguously ascertain the momentum-space origin of distinct dispersing channels along high-symmetry directions and identify those originating from time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our analysis also reveals that the surface state survives far above the energy where angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy finds the onset of continuum bulk bands.",
