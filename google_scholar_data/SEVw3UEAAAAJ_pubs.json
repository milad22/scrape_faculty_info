Large-aspect-ratio Sweet-Parker current sheets are shown to be unstable to super-Alfv\u00e9nically fast formation of plasmoid (magnetic-island) chains. The plasmoid number scales as S 3\/8 and the instability growth rate in the linear stage as S 1\/4, in agreement with the theory by Loureiro et al.[Phys. Plasmas 14, 100703 (2007)]. In the nonlinear regime, plasmoids continue to grow faster than they are ejected and completely disrupt the reconnection layer. These results suggest that high-Lundquist-number reconnection is inherently time-dependent and hence call for a substantial revision of the standard Sweet-Parker quasistationary picture for S> 10 4.",

The key geometry factors that influence the effectiveness of turbulence suppression by flow shear are discussed, and we show that toroidal equilibrium flow shear can sometimes entirely suppress ion scale turbulence in today's STs. Advanced nonlinear simulations of electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven turbulence, including kinetic ion physics, collisions and equilibrium flow shear, support the model that ETG turbulence can explain electron heat transport in many ST discharges.",
