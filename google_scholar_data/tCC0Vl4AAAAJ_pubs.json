HiRes\u2019 measurement of the flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays shows a sharp suppression at an energy of 6\u00d7 10 19 eV, consistent with the expected cutoff energy. We observe the ankle of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum as well, at an energy of 4\u00d7 10 18 eV. We describe the experiment, data collection, and analysis and estimate the systematic uncertainties. The results are presented and the calculation of the statistical significance of our observation is described.",

This measurement is based upon four years of observation by the surface detector component of TA. The spectrum shows a dip at an energy of 4.6\u00d7 10 18 eV and a steepening at 5.4\u00d7 10 19 eV which is consistent with the expectation from the GZK cutoff. We present the results of a technique, new to the analysis of UHECR surface detector data, that involves generating a complete simulation of UHECRs striking the TA surface detector. The procedure starts with shower simulations using the CORSIKA Monte Carlo program where we have solved the problems caused by use of the\" thinning\" approximation. This simulation method allows us to make an accurate calculation of the acceptance of the detector for the energies concerned.",

The hotspot has a Li-Ma statistical significance of 5.1 \u03c3, and is centered at RA= 146 fdg 7, decl.= 43 fdg 2. The position of the hotspot is about 19 off of the supergalactic plane. The probability of a cluster of events of 5.1 \u03c3 significance, appearing by chance in an isotropic cosmic-ray sky, is estimated to be 3.7\u00d7 10\u20134 (3.4 \u03c3).",

            "Since 2007, the Telescope Array (TA) experiment, based in Utah, USA, has been observing ultra high energy cosmic rays to understand their origins. The experiment includes a surface detector (SD) array and three fluorescence detector (FD) stations. The FD stations, installed surrounding the SD array, measure the air fluorescence light emitted from extensive air showers (EASs) for precise determination of their energies and species. The detectors employed at one of the three FD stations were relocated from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) experiment. At the other two stations, newly designed detectors were constructed for the TA experiment. An FD consists of a primary mirror and a camera equipped with photomultiplier tube pixels. To obtain the EAS parameters with high accuracy, understanding the FD optical characteristics is important. In this paper, we report the characteristics and installation of the new \u2026",
