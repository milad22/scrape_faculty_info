            "Satellite observations of enhanced energetic particle fluxes in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA) region have been supported by ground-based observations of enhanced ionization induced by particle precipitation in the ionosphere over this region. Past observations using a variety of instruments such as vertical sounding ionosondes, riometers and VLF receivers have provided evidences of the enhanced ionization due to energetic particle precipitation in the ionosphere over Brazil. The extra ionization at E-layer heights could produce enhanced ionospheric conductivity within and around the SAMA region. The energetic particle ionization source that is operative even under \u201cquiet\u201d conditions can undergo significant enhancements during magnetospheric storm disturbances, when the geographic region of enhanced ionospheric conductivity can extend to magnetic latitudes closer to the equator where \u2026",

The PW scale oscillations in the PRE produces strong modulation in the equatorial spread F (ESF) irregularity processes as diagnosed by the digisondes. Considerations on the PRE development mechanism involving the E layer integrated conductivity including the effect of metallic ions and tidal winds point to the source of the PRE oscillations to be PW modulation of E region tidal winds. The PW oscillations in PRE appear to be an important source of the day\u2010to\u2010day variability in the ESF.",

The data are obtained by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (42.6\u00b0N, 288.5\u00b0E) on 18\u201331 January 2010, in coincidence with a major sudden stratospheric warming. We elucidate oscillations in ion temperature with both tidal periods (~8\u2009h and ~12\u2009h) and non\u2010tidal periods (>24\u2009h) by analyzing residuals between the observed temperatures and those expected from an empirical model. We present the spatial\u2010temporal development of periodicities in ion temperature and discuss to what degree these periodicities might be related to the sudden stratospheric warming event. The spectral location and temporal evolution of periodicities with ~9.9\u201312.9\u2009h and ~6.2\u20137.9\u2009h suggest that they are related to the semidiurnal \u2026",

This observation was made with the K Doppler lidar at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (18.35\u00b0N; 66.75\u00b0W) on 12 March 2005. The layer was first observed before 08:00 UT (04:00 AST) centered near 145 km with the vertical extent up to \u223c155 km, and then it descended to near 126 km just over 2 h later at dawn. The descent rate of 2.56\u00b10.38 m\/s matches the vertical phase speed of the GSWM09-computed semidiurnal tide between 120 and 150 km. This also matches the descent rates of the thermospheric semidiurnal tides measured at Arecibo. Although the K density above 120 km remains less than 1 cm\u22123, its presence is unequivocal and has strong similarities to the neutral iron (Fe) layers in the thermosphere over 155 km recently discovered by lidar observations at McMurdo, Antarctica.

We show and discuss the solar and geomagnetic dependencies as well as the long\u2010term trend of the TNW components and their variation over time and season. A main result of this study was the detection of a substantial seasonal and local time dependence of the response of the TNW to solar and geomagnetic activity. In addition, we found that there is a long\u2010term trend in the thermospheric neutral wind, which can be of a larger magnitude than the variation found in the seasonal, solar cycle, and geomagnetic activity influences. A major signature of this trend over the last 30 years was an increase in the meridional northward component up to 1.4 m s\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 before midnight local time \u2026",

The model was developed using nearly 25 years of incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements made at the Arecibo Observatory (AO) between 1985 and 2009. The model describes the variability of the F2 peak frequency (foF2) and F2 peak height (hmF2) as a function of local time, season, and solar activity for quiet\u2010to\u2010moderate geomagnetic activity conditions (Kp < 4+). Our results show that the solar activity control of hmF2 and foF2 over Arecibo can be better described by a new proxy of the solar flux (F107P), which is presented here. The variation of hmF2 parameter with F107P is virtually linear, and only a small saturation of the foF2 parameter is observed at the highest levels of solar flux.
