            "We demonstrate critical behavior in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) that are isolated directly from living cells. GPMVs contain two liquid phases at low temperatures and one liquid phase at high temperatures and exhibit transition temperatures in the range of 15 to 25 \u00b0C. In the two-phase region, line tensions linearly approach zero as temperature is increased to the transition. In the one-phase region, micrometer-scale composition fluctuations occur and become increasingly large and long-lived as temperature is decreased to the transition. These results indicate proximity to a critical point and are quantitatively consistent with established theory. Our observations of robust critical fluctuations suggest that the compositions of mammalian plasma membranes are tuned to reside near a miscibility critical point and that heterogeneity corresponding to <50 nm-sized compositional fluctuations are present in \u2026",

When membranes are prepared from a ternary lipid mixture at a critical composition, they pass through a miscibility critical point at the transition temperature. Since the critical temperature is typically on the order of room temperature, membranes provide an unusual opportunity in which to perform a quantitative study of biophysical systems that exhibit critical phenomena in the two-dimensional Ising universality class. As a critical point is approached from either high or low temperature, the scale of fluctuations in lipid composition, set by the correlation length, diverges. In addition, as a critical point is approached from low temperature, the line tension between coexisting phases \u2026",

We first review basic concepts and equations associated with critical phenomena for the general reader. We then apply these concepts to the specific biophysical system of lipid membranes. We recently reported that lipid membranes can contain composition fluctuations that behave in a manner consistent with the two-dimensional Ising universality class. Near the membrane's critical point, these fluctuations are micron-sized, clearly observable by fluorescence microscopy. At higher temperatures, above the critical point, we expect to find submicron fluctuations. In separate work, we have reported that plasma membranes isolated directly from cells exhibit the same Ising behavior as model membranes do.

Domains appear after a rapid temperature quench, when the membrane is cooled through a miscibility phase transition such that coexisting liquid phases form. In membranes quenched far from a miscibility critical point, circular domains nucleate and then progress within seconds to late stage coarsening in which domains grow via two mechanisms 1), collision and coalescence of liquid domains, and 2), Ostwald ripening. Both mechanisms are expected to yield the same growth exponent, \u03b1 = 1\/3, where domain radius grows as time\u03b1. We measure \u03b1 = 0.28 \u00b1 0.05, in excellent agreement.

Here we introduce a new method based on quantification of the large-scale circulation patterns induced inside vesicles adhered to a solid surface and subjected to simple shear flow in a microfluidic device. Particle image velocimetry based on spinning disk confocal imaging of tracer particles inside and outside of the vesicle and tracking of phase-separated membrane domains are used to reconstruct the full three-dimensional flow pattern induced by the shear. These measurements show excellent agreement with the predictions of a recent theoretical analysis, and allow direct determination of the membrane viscosity.",

Colocalized domains have never been observed to spontaneously move out of registry. This result indicates that the lipid compositions in one leaflet are strongly coupled to compositions in the opposing leaflet. Predictions of the interleaflet coupling parameter, \u039b, vary by a factor of 50. We measure the value of \u039b by applying high shear forces to supported lipid bilayers.

Yet most studies of development average their observations and, discarding the variability, seek to derive models, biological or physical, that explain these average observations. Here, we analyse this variability in a study of cell sheet folding in the green alga Volvox, whose spherical embryos turn themselves inside out in a process sharing invagination, expansion, involution, and peeling of a cell sheet with animal models of morphogenesis. We generalise our earlier, qualitative model of the initial stages of inversion by combining ideas from morphoelasticity and shell theory. Together with three-dimensional visualisations of inversion using light sheet microscopy, this yields a detailed, quantitative model of the entire inversion process. With this model, we show how the variability of inversion reveals that two separate, temporally uncoupled processes drive the initial invagination and subsequent expansion of the cell sheet. This implies a prototypical transition towards higher developmental complexity in the volvocine algae and provides proof of principle of analysing morphogenesis based on its variability.",
