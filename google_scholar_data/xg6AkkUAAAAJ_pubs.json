            "NMR spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful technique to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. Fundamentals of Protein NMR Spectroscopy is a comprehensive textbook that guides the reader from a basic understanding of the phenomenological properties of magnetic resonance to the application and interpretation of modern multi-dimensional NMR experiments on 15N\/13C-labeled proteins. Beginning with elementary quantum mechanics, a set of practical rules is presented and used to describe many commonly employed multi-dimensional, multi-nuclear NMR pulse sequences. A modular analysis of NMR pulse sequence building blocks also provides a basis for understanding and developing novel pulse programs. This text not only covers topics from chemical shift assignment to protein structure refinement, as well as the analysis of protein dynamics and chemical kinetics, but also provides a practical guide to many aspects of modern spectrometer hardware, sample preparation, experimental set-up, and data processing. End of chapter exercises are included to emphasize important concepts. Fundamentals of Protein NMR Spectroscopy not only offer students a systematic, in-depth, understanding of modern NMR spectroscopy and its application to biomolecular systems, but will also be a useful reference for the experienced investigator.",

Immune cells, e.g., macrophages, play crucial roles in many pathophysiological processes, including organ rejection, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, cancer, atherosclerotic plaque formation, numerous neurological disorders, etc. The current gold standard for diagnosing and staging rejection after organ transplantation is biopsy, which is not only invasive, but also prone to sampling errors. Here, we report a noninvasive approach using MRI to detect graft rejection after solid organ transplantation. In addition, we present the feasibility of imaging individual macrophages in vivo by MRI in a rodent heterotopic working-heart transplantation model using a more sensitive contrast agent, the micrometer-sized paramagnetic iron oxide particle, as a methodology to detect acute cardiac rejection.",

Studies indicate the involvement of host macrophages in the development of CR; however, the precise role of these cells in CR is unclear. Thus, it is important to develop noninvasive techniques to serially monitor the movement and distribution of recipient macrophages in chronic cardiac allograft rejection in vivo.Methods and Results\u2014 We have employed a rat heterotopic working-heart CR model for a magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Twenty-one allograft (PVG.1U\u2192PVG.R8) and 9 isograft (PVG.R8\u2192PVG.R8) transplantations were performed. Recipient macrophages are labeled via intravenous injection of micron-sized paramagnetic iron oxide particles (0.9 \u03bcm in diameter) at a dose of 4.5 mg Fe per rat 1 day before transplantation.

            "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations after asphyxial cardiac arrest (CA) are not defined in developmental animal models or humans. We characterized regional and temporal changes in CBF from 5 to 150 mins after asphyxial CA of increasing duration (8.5, 9, 12 min) in postnatal day (PND) 17 rats using the noninvasive method of arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI). We also assessed blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and evaluated the relationship between CBF and mean arterial pressure after resuscitation. After all durations of asphyxia CBF alterations were region dependent. After 8.5- and 9-min asphyxia, intense subcortical hyperemia at 5 min was followed by return of CBF to baseline values by 10 mins. After 12-min asphyxia, hyperemia was absent and hypoperfusion reached a nadir of 38% to 65% of baselines with the lowest values in the cortex. BBB was impermeable to \u2026",
