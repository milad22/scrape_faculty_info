            "The mitochondrial outer membrane contains machinery for the import of preproteins encoded by nuclear genes 1, 2, 3. Eight different Tom (translocase of outer membrane) proteins have been identified that function as receptors and\/or are related to a hypothetical general import pore. Many mitochondrial membrane channel activities have been described 4, 5, 6, 7, including one related to Tim23 of the inner-membrane protein-import system 5; however, the pore-forming subunit (s) of the Tom machinery have not been identified until now. Here we describe the expression and functional reconstitution of Tom40, an integral membrane protein with mainly \u03b2-sheet structure. Tom40 forms a cation-selective high-conductance channel that specifically binds to and transports mitochondrial-targeting sequences added to the cis side of the membrane. We conclude that Tom40 is the pore-forming subunit of the mitochondrial \u2026",

We purified the protein insertion complex (TIM22 complex), a twin-pore translocase that mediated the insertion of precursor proteins in a three-step process. After the precursor is tethered to the translocase without losing energy from the \u0394\u03c8, two energy-requiring steps were needed. First, \u0394\u03c8 acted on the precursor protein and promoted its docking in the translocase complex. Then, \u0394\u03c8 and an internal signal peptide together induced rapid gating transitions in one pore and closing of the other pore and drove membrane insertion to completion. Thus, protein insertion was driven by the coordinated action of a twin-pore complex in two voltage-dependent steps.",

            "The chloroplastic outer envelope protein OEP75 with a molecular weight of 75 kDa probably forms the central pore of the protein import machinery of the outer chloroplastic membrane. Patch\u2013clamp analysis shows that heterologously expressed, purified and reconstituted OEP75 constitutes a voltage-gated ion channel with a unit conductance of \u039b 145pS. Activation of the OEP75 channel in vitro is completely dependent on the magnitude and direction of the voltage gradient. Therefore, movements of protein charges of parts of OEP75 in the membrane electric field are required either for pore formation or its opening. In the presence of precursor protein from only one side of the bilayer, strong flickering and partial closing of the channel was observed, indicating a specific interaction of the precursor with OEP75. The comparatively low ionic conductance of OEP75 is compatible with a rather narrow aqueous pore (dpore \u2026",

            "Aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein is a key event in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease. Recent findings suggest that oligomers represent the principal toxic aggregate species. Using confocal single-molecule fluorescence techniques, such as scanning for intensely fluorescent targets (SIFT) and atomic force microscopy, we monitored \u03b1-synuclein oligomer formation at the single particle level. Organic solvents were used to trigger aggregation, which resulted in small oligomers (\u201cintermediate I\u201d). Under these conditions, Fe3+ at low micromolar concentrations dramatically increased aggregation and induced formation of larger oligomers (\u201cintermediate II\u201d). Both oligomer species were on-pathway to amyloid fibrils and could seed amyloid formation. Notably, only Fe3+-induced oligomers were SDS-resistant and could form ion-permeable pores in a planar lipid bilayer, which were inhibited by the \u2026",
