The calculations begin with correlated many-body wave functions that have an \u03b1-like core and multiple p-shell nucleons, LS-coupled to the appropriate (J \u03c0; T) quantum numbers for the state of interest. After optimization, these variational trial functions are used as input to a Green\u2019s function Monte Carlo calculation of the energy, using a constrained path algorithm. We find that the Hamiltonians that include Illinois three-nucleon potentials reproduce ten states in 9 Li, 9 Be, 10 Be, and 10 B with an rms deviation as little as 900 keV. In particular, we obtain the correct 3+ ground state for 10 B, whereas the Argonne v 18 alone \u2026",

What we call dynamical microscopic theories are those in which the decay width is derived from the nucleonic structures, of the participating nuclei, which are deduced through the solution of their equations of motion. After a brief review of the various expressions for the decay width, we turn to the nuclear-structure aspects of the problem. We thoroughly discuss the treatment of the Pauli effects in models involving macroscopic elements. We settle the long-standing controversy over the cluster-core norm operator that relates microscopic and macroscopic relative-motion wave functions in the transition amplitude. We conclude that the way the norm operator was originally introduced in the mid-1970s is in principle correct. The main \u2026",

            "The variational method complemented with the use of explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions is one of the most powerful approaches currently used for calculating the properties of few-body systems. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the method offers great flexibility, high accuracy, and can be used to study diverse quantum systems, ranging from small atoms and molecules to light nuclei, hadrons, quantum dots, and Efimov systems. The basic theoretical foundations are discussed, recent advances in the applications of explicitly correlated Gaussians in physics and chemistry are reviewed, and the strengths and weaknesses of the explicitly correlated Gaussians approach are compared with other few-body techniques.",

            "We study the performance of some recent potential models suggested as effective interactions between constituent quarks. In particular, we address constituent quark models for baryons with hybrid Q\u2212 Q interactions stemming from one-gluon plus meson exchanges. Upon recalculating two of such models we find them to fail in describing the N and \u0394 spectra. Our calculations are based on accurate solutions of the three-quark systems in both a variational Schr\u00f6dinger and a rigorous Faddeev approach. It is argued that hybrid Q\u2212 Q interactions with a sizable one-gluon-exchange component encounter difficulties in describing baryon spectra due to the specific contributions from one-gluon and meson exchanges together. In contrast, a chiral constituent quark model with a Q\u2212 Q interaction relying solely on Goldstone-boson exchange is capable of providing a unified description not only of the N and \u0394 spectra but also \u2026",

The binding energies and annihilation rates for seven exotic species with electronically stable ground states, namely HPs,, LiPs,,, NaPs and have been predicted. The binding energy for HPs, 0.038 1944 Hartree, is the largest attained so far. Two of the species, and, with approximate binding energies of 0.0024 and 0.0005 Hartree respectively, are seen to have structures best described as a positronium atom orbiting a residual or positively charged core. The atom with an approximate binding energy of 0.0028 Hartree is best characterized as a positron orbiting a polarized Be core. The binding energy of the ground state, 0.014 Hartree, is larger than that of any other positronic atom (a neutral atom with an attached \u2026",
