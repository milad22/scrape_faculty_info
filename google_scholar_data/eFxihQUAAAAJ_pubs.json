This error resulted in the reported wave amplitudes being too high by a factor of (2\u03c0) 1\/2. The error does affect multiple calculations, figures, and data in tables. It does not alter the principal conclusion on the dominance of chorus scattering in producing the diffuse aurora. It does, however, affect the overall rates of pitch angle and momentum diffusion, and the resultant temporal evolution of electron phase space density in our subsequent 2D Fokker-Planck simulations.[3] The specifics of how the error manifested itself in the papers are listed below.[4] The recent analysis of the scattering of plasma sheet electrons [Ni et al., 2011a, 2011b] employed CRRES wave data obtained from the 0000 to 0600 MLT range [Meredith et al., 2009] to construct a statistical model for the average spectral intensity of both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves, and upper band (f> fce\/2) and lower band (f< fce\/2) chorus emissions in the inner magnetosphere over the spatial region where diffuse auroral precipitation is most intense [Newell et al., 2009]. The wave model was subsequently used to evaluate the scattering of plasma sheet electrons from 30 eV to 100 keV under different levels of geomagnetic activity. To evaluate electron pitch angle and momentum diffusion rates, a least square Gaussian fit was applied to the frequency distribution of wave spectral intensity [eg, Glauert and Horne, 2005]. The key parameters obtained for the chorus Gaussian distribution included magnetic field wave amplitude (Bw \u2026",

However, the precise physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration on 9 October was not identified. Previous modelling has indicated that a magnetospheric electromagnetic emission known as chorus could be a potential candidate for local electron acceleration 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, but a definitive resolution of the importance of chorus for radiation-belt acceleration was not possible because of limitations in the energy range and resolution of previous electron observations and the lack of a dynamic global wave model.

            "We quantify the resonant scattering effects of the unusual low\u2010frequency dawnside plasmaspheric hiss observed on 30 September 2012 by the Van Allen Probes. In contrast to normal (~100\u20132000\u2009Hz) hiss emissions, this unusual hiss event contained most of its wave power at ~20\u2013200\u2009Hz. Compared to the scattering by normal hiss, the unusual hiss scattering speeds up the loss of ~50\u2013200\u2009keV electrons and produces more pronounced pancake distributions of ~50\u2013100\u2009keV electrons. It is demonstrated that such unusual low\u2010frequency hiss, even with a duration of a couple of hours, plays a particularly important role in the decay and loss process of energetic electrons, resulting in shorter electron lifetimes for ~50\u2013400\u2009keV electrons than normal hiss, and should be carefully incorporated into global modeling of radiation belt electron dynamics during periods of intense injections.",
