            "Interfaces between materials present unique opportunities for the discovery of intriguing quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the possibility that, in the case of superlattices, if one of the layers is made ultrathin, unexpected properties can be induced between the two bracketing interfaces. We pursue this objective by combining advanced growth and characterization techniques with theoretical calculations. Using prototype La2\/3Sr1\/3MnO3 (LSMO)\/BaTiO3 (BTO) superlattices, we observe a structural evolution in the LSMO layers as a function of thickness. Atomic-resolution EM and spectroscopy reveal an unusual polar structure phase in ultrathin LSMO at a critical thickness caused by interfacing with the adjacent BTO layers, which is confirmed by first principles calculations. Most important is the fact that this polar phase is accompanied by reemergent ferromagnetism, making this system a potential candidate for \u2026",

Although extensively studied, the intrinsic instability of these materials complicates synthesis and precludes an understanding of how fundamental properties associated with the nature of the chemical bond and electron pairing in organic materials systems manifest in practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a conjugated polymer semiconductor, based on alternating cyclopentadithiophene and thiadiazoloquinoxaline units, that is a ground-state triplet in its neutral form.

We observe an increase in unit cell volume indicating that both Al and Ga substitutions create negative chemical pressure. There are substantial increases in the Curie temperature and the ordered moment demonstrating that the substitutions give the magnetism a stronger itinerant character. The substitutions also increase the range of temperature and field where the skyrmion phase is stable due to a change in the character of the magnetism. In contrast to the behavior of pure MnSi and expectations for the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we find a significant temperature dependence to the magnitude and sign of anomalous Hall conductivity constant in Al or Ga substituted samples. This temperature dependence likely reflects changes in the spin-orbit \u2026",

However, the nature of extended defect generation is highly elusive due to the presence of multiple nucleation mechanisms with close energetics. A strategy to design extended defects in a simple and clean way is thus highly desirable to advance the understanding of their role, improve material quality, and serve as a unique playground to discover new phenomena.

This abnormal behavior is associated with the oxygen vacancies which exist on the surface region but also penetrate deep into the bulk Fe3O4. In contrast, OH bonding becomes preferential as generally expected on an ozone processed surface, which has appreciably less oxygen vacancies. Such bonding site selective behavior, depending on oxygen vacancy concentrations, is further confirmed with DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an opportunity for tuning the chemical properties of oxide surfaces or oxide clusters.",

The nontrivial band crossing protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry plays a crucial role in physical properties. We have grown high-quality single crystals of PdSb 2 and characterized their physical properties under several stimuli (temperature, magnetic field, and pressure). While it is a diamagnetic Fermi-liquid metal under ambient pressure, PdSb 2 exhibits a large magnetoresistance with continuous increase up to 14 T, which follows Kohler's scaling law at all temperatures. This implies one-band electrical transport, although multiple bands are predicted by first-principles calculations.

Azimuthal angular dependence studies in reflection geometry under eight possible polarization configurations reveal strong surface-bulk interference owing to heterodyne amplification. The crystal symmetry and the surface quadrupole contributions need to be considered to properly interpret the resulting nonlinear spectroscopic signals. In addition, over bandgap excitation by one of the incident beams brings the semiconductor surface to a transient excited state, enabling enhanced sensitivity of broadband SFG to probe the surface electronic properties of non-centrosymmetric semiconductors.

It exhibits a surface structural distortion, quantified here using low energy electron diffraction at room temperature. Structural analysis shows the presence of strong surface rumpling in the TiO2 terminated surface with the oxygen atoms moving outward and Ti atoms moving inward. Density functional calculations confirm the measured rumpling, and experimental data show the distortion is localized at the surface. Angle-dependent core-level X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the surface rumpling strongly impacts the electronic structure of the surface. This observation is reinforced by density functional theory, which demonstrates that the valence state of Ti at the surface is reduced while O is enhanced, where we found the Ti\u2013O bonds are more covalent near the surface.

Using atomically resolved transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy as well as low-energy electron diffraction, the structure of the thin film, from interface to the surface, has been studied. In this paper, we show that the proper processing can lead to a structure that is ordered, coherent with the substrate without intermediate structural phase.
