            "A nanopore-based device provides single-molecule detection and analytical capabilities that are achieved by electrophoretically driving molecules in solution through a nano-scale pore. The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility.

Notable examples include \u03b1-hemolysin protein nanopores in lipid membranes 1, 2 and solid-state nanopores 3 in Si 3 N 4. Here we report a new technique for fabricating silicon oxide nanopores with single-nanometre precision and direct visual feedback, using state-of-the-art silicon technology and transmission electron microscopy. First, a pore of 20 nm is opened in a silicon membrane by using electron-beam lithography and anisotropic etching. After thermal oxidation, the pore can be reduced to a single-nanometre when it is exposed to a high-energy electron beam. This fluidizes the silicon oxide leading to a shrinking of the small hole due to surface tension. When the electron beam is switched off, the material quenches \u2026",

Thus our experiment is the superconducting analog of monitoring the granular avalanches produced by slowly dropping sand on a sandpile.

Direct imaging of these defects verified that their stable configurations have lower symmetry than the underlying triangular lattice, as predicted by numerical simulations for a number of two-dimensional systems 4, 5, 6, 7.

However, it is intrinsically difficult to control the DNA motion in standard DNA translocation processes in which a strong electric field is required in drawing DNA into the pore, but it also leads to uncontrollable fast DNA translocation. Here we explore a new type of DNA translocation. We dub it'reverse DNA translocation', in which the DNA is pulled through a nanopore mechanically by a magnetic bead, driven by a magnetic-field gradient. This technique is compatible with simultaneous ionic current measurements and is suitable for multiple nanopores, paving the way for large scale applications.

            "We demonstrate a novel method of introducing point defects (mono-and divacancies) in a confined monolayer colloidal crystal by manipulating individual particles with optical tweezers. Digital video microscopy is used to study defect dynamics in real space and time. We verify the numerical predictions that the stable configurations of the defects have reduced symmetry compared to the triangular lattice and discover that in addition they are characterized by distinct topological arrangements of the particles in the defect core. Surprisingly, point defects are thermally excited into separated dislocations, from which we extract the dislocation pair potential.",
