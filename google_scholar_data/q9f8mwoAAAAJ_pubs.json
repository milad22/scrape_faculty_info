            "Proton transfer from the excited states of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol to the water solvent is studied in water\/alcohol mixtures. In pure water, the deprotonation rate of 1-naphthol is insensitive totemperature (AH*= 0), while thatof 2-naphthol exhibits an activation energy of about 2600 cal mol\" 1. The deprotonation rates in both molecules decrease nonlinearly as the alcohol concentration increases, becoming effectively zero in pure alcohol. Variation of solvent concentrations in the mixed solvent thus serves as a probe for studying the local reaction environment. Using a Markov random walk theory, a water cluster,(H20) 4\u00b1l, is identified as the effective acceptor for both molecules, indicating that the structure H904+ plays a direct role in the proton hydration dynamics. At high water concentrations the proton hydration rate is \u201creaction controlled\u201d, while at high alcohol concentrations it can become \u201cdiffusion controlled \u2026",

This process is studied by using both picosecond, time-resolved emission spectroscopy and steady-state spectrofluorometry. A detailed model of the ESPT kinetics is developed byusing the results of these experiments. Computer simulations are used to evaluate thepredictions of this kinetic model by comparison with the actual temporal and spectral data taken over a wide range of experimental conditions. On the basis of such analyses, the rates for excited-state proton transfer and reprotonation in 1-naphthol are 2.5 X 1010 s-1 and 6.8 X 10 M-1 s-1 in H20 (pATa*= 0.4) and 7.9 X 109 s-1 and 4.8 X 10 M-1 s-1 in D20 (pKf= 0.8), respectively.

The differences between the two molecules, PTP and R6G, provide a means of evaluating the role of solute structure and solute\u2013solvent interactions on the dynamics of rotational reorientation. The rotational behavior of PTP is well described by simple hydrodynamic models as embodied by the Stokes\u2013Einstein\u2013Debye equation.
