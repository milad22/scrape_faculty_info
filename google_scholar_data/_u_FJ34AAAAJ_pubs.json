            "We describe the design of a new polarization sensitive receiver, spt-3g, for the 10-meter South Pole Telescope (spt). The spt-3g receiver will deliver a factor of ~20 improvement in mapping speed over the current receiver, spt-pol. The sensitivity of the spt-3g receiver will enable the advance from statistical detection of B-mode polarization anisotropy power to high signal-to-noise measurements of the individual modes, i.e., maps. This will lead to precise (~0.06 eV) constraints on the sum of neutrino masses with the potential to directly address the neutrino mass hierarchy. It will allow a separation of the lensing and inflationary B-mode power spectra, improving constraints on the amplitude and shape of the primordial signal, either through spt-3g data alone or in combination with bicep2\/keck, which is observing the same area of sky. The measurement of small-scale temperature anisotropy will provide new constraints \u2026",

            "This work presents the procedures used at Argonne National Laboratory to fabricate large arrays of multichroic transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers for cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. These detectors will be assembled into the focal plane for the SPT-3G camera, the third generation CMB camera to be installed in the South Pole Telescope. The complete SPT-3G camera will have approximately 2690 pixels, for a total of 16 140 TES bolometric detectors. Each pixel is comprised of a broad-band sinuous antenna coupled to a Nb microstrip line. In-line filters are used to define the different bands before the millimeter-wavelength signal is fed to the respective Ti\/Au TES bolometers. There are six TES bolometer detectors per pixel, which allow for measurements of three band-passes (95, 150 and 220 GHz) and two polarizations. The steps involved in the monolithic fabrication of these detector \u2026",

The increase in detector count is made possible by lenslet-coupled trichroic polarization-sensitive pixels fabricated at Argonne National Laboratory, new 68 frequency-domain multiplexing readout electronics, and a higher-throughput optical design. The enhanced sensitivity of SPT-3G will enable a wide range of results including constraints on primordial B-mode polarization, measurements of gravitational lensing of the CMB, and a galaxy cluster survey. Here we present an overview of the instrument and its science objectives, highlighting its measured performance and plans for the upcoming 2018 observing season.",
