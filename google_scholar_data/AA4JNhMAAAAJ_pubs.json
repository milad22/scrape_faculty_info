            "The rise of two-dimensional (2D) materials research took place following the isolation of graphene in 2004. These new 2D materials include transition metal dichalcogenides, mono-elemental 2D sheets, and several carbide-and nitride-based materials. The number of publications related to these emerging materials has been drastically increasing over the last five years. Thus, through this comprehensive review, we aim to discuss the most recent groundbreaking discoveries as well as emerging opportunities and remaining challenges. This review starts out by delving into the improved methods of producing these new 2D materials via controlled exfoliation, metal organic chemical vapor deposition, and wet chemical means. We look into recent studies of doping as well as the optical properties of 2D materials and their heterostructures. Recent advances towards applications of these materials in 2D electronics are \u2026",

            "Electron spin is fundamental in electrical and optical properties of organic electronic devices. Despite recent interest in spin mixing and spin transport in organic semiconductors, the actual spin coherence times in these materials have remained elusive. Measurements of spin coherence provide impartial insight into spin relaxation mechanisms, which is significant in view of recent models of spin-dependent transport and recombination involving high levels of spin mixing. We demonstrate coherent manipulation of spins in an organic light-emitting diode (OLED), using nanosecond pulsed electrically detected electron spin resonance to drive singlet\u2013triplet spin Rabi oscillations. By measuring the change in photovoltaic response due to spin-dependent recombination, we demonstrate spin control of electronic transport and thus directly observe spin coherence over 0.5 \u03bcs.

We used single-particle light-harvesting action spectroscopy to probe the impact of particle morphology on energy transfer and carrier relaxation across a heterojunction. The generic form of an action spectrum [in our experiments, photoluminescence excitation (PLE) under absorption in CdS and emission from CdSe in nanocrystal tetrapods, rods, and spheres] was controlled by the physical shape and resulting morphological variation in the quantum confinement parameters of the nanoparticle. A correlation between single-particle PLE and physical shape as determined by scanning electron microscopy was demonstrated.

Although metal oxide semiconductors have been investigated for their promise to resist oxidative attack, materials in this class can suffer from chemical and photochemical instability. Here we present a methodology for evaluating corrosion mechanisms and apply it to bismuth vanadate, a state-of-the-art photoanode. Analysis of changing morphology and composition under solar water splitting conditions reveals chemical instabilities that are not predicted from thermodynamic considerations of stable solid oxide phases, as represented by the Pourbaix diagram for the system. Computational modelling indicates that photoexcited charge carriers accumulated at the surface destabilize the lattice, and that self-passivation by formation of a chemically stable surface phase is kinetically \u2026",
