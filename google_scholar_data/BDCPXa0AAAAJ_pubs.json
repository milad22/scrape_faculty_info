            "Single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is increasingly being used to determine distances, structures, and dynamics of biomolecules in vitro and in vivo. However, generalized protocols and FRET standards to ensure the reproducibility and accuracy of measurements of FRET efficiencies are currently lacking. Here we report the results of a comparative blind study in which 20 labs determined the FRET efficiencies (E) of several dye-labeled DNA duplexes. Using a unified, straightforward method, we obtained FRET efficiencies with sd between\u00b10.02 and\u00b10.05. We suggest experimental and computational procedures for converting FRET efficiencies into accurate distances, and discuss potential uncertainties in the experiment and the modeling.

Both the crowding density and relative size of each co-solute in a mixture will contribute to the measured microviscosity as assessed by altered translational mobility. Using multiphoton fluorescent correlation spectroscopy, this study addresses how excluded volume of dextran polymers from 10 to 500 kDa affect microviscosity quantified by measurements of calmodulin labeled with green fluorescent protein as the diffusing probe. Autocorrelation functions were fit using both a multiple-component model with maximum entropy method (MEMFCS) and an anomalous model.

            "One of the key questions regarding intracellular diffusion is how the environment affects molecular mobility. Mostly, intracellular diffusion has been described as hindered, and the physical reasons for this behavior are: immobile barriers, molecular crowding, and binding interactions with immobile or mobile molecules. Using results from multi-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we describe how immobile barriers and crowding agents affect translational mobility. To study the hindrance produced by immobile barriers, we used sol-gels (silica nanostructures) that consist of a continuous solid phase and aqueous phase in which fluorescently tagged molecules diffuse. In the case of molecular crowding, translational mobility was assessed in increasing concentrations of 500 kDa dextran solutions. Diffusion of fluorescent tracers in both sol-gels and dextran solutions shows clear evidence of anomalous \u2026",

CaMKII is a dodecameric complex with a special architecture that provides it with unique potential for organizing the actin cytoskeleton. We report using biochemical assays that the \u03b2 isoform of CaMKII binds to and bundles actin filaments, and the disposition of \u03b2CaMKII within the actin bundles was revealed by cryoelectron tomography. In addition, \u03b2CaMKII was found to inhibit actin polymerization, suggesting that it either serves as a capping protein or binds monomeric actin, reducing the amount of freely available monomers to nucleate polymer assembly. By means of fluorescent cross-correlation spectroscopy, we determined that \u03b2CaMKII does indeed bind to monomeric actin, reaching saturation at a \u2026",

This double layer, which affects the measured impedance, is also known as the electrode polarization effect. Various methods of correcting for its effects on impedance data have been reported, including varying the spacing between electrodes, four-electrode techniques, and electrodeless methods. Here we discuss the use of a constant phase element in a recently proposed circuit model, which can be thought of as a measure of the fractal nature of the interface. We also report on the conductivity spectra of several saline solutions over the frequency range 1 Hz\u20131 MHz, in which we observe Debye-like relaxation behavior that changes with ion \u2026",

Here, we report the spatial diffusivity and availability of CaM labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-CaM, at basal and elevated Ca2+, quantified by the novel fluorescent techniques of raster image scanning spectroscopy and number and brightness analysis. Our results show that in basal Ca2+ conditions cytoplasmic eGFP-CaM diffuses at a rate of 10 \u03bcm2\/s, twofold slower than the noninteracting tracer, eGFP, indicating that a significant fraction of CaM is diffusing bound to other partners.

CaM is a dumbbell-shaped molecule that contains four EF hands (two in the N-lobe and two in the C-lobe) that each could bind Ca2+, leading to stabilization of certain substates that favor interactions with other target proteins.
