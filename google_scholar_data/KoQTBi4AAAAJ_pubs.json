            "k nearest neighbor (kNN) method is a popular classification method in data mining and statistics because of its simple implementation and significant classification performance. However, it is impractical for traditional kNN methods to assign a fixed k value (even though set by experts) to all test samples. Previous solutions assign different k values to different test samples by the cross validation method but are usually time-consuming. This paper proposes a kTree method to learn different optimal k values for different test\/new samples, by involving a training stage in the kNN classification. Specifically, in the training stage, kTree method first learns optimal k values for all training samples by a new sparse reconstruction model, and then constructs a decision tree (namely, kTree) using training samples and the learned optimal k values. In the test stage, the kTree fast outputs the optimal k value for each test sample, and \u2026",

Humans convey emotional information both intentionally and unintentionally via speech patterns. These vocal patterns are perceived and understood by listeners during conversation. This research aims to improve the automatic perception of vocal emotion in two ways. First, we compare two emotional speech data sources: natural, spontaneous emotional speech and acted or portrayed emotional speech. This comparison demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of both acquisition methods and how these methods affect the end application of vocal emotion recognition. Second, we look at two classification methods which have not been applied in this field \u2026",

Recently, the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique is introduced into service recommendation to pursue high recommendation efficiency and the capability of privacy-preservation, especially when the historical service quality (QoS) data used to make recommendation decisions are distributed across different platforms. However, existing LSH-based service recommendation approaches often face the following challenge: they often assume that the QoS data for service recommendation are static and unique, without considering the influence of dynamic context (e.g., time) on QoS. In view of this challenge, we extend the traditional LSH technique to incorporate the time factor and further propose a novel time-aware and privacy-preserving \u2026",

            "Road detection is one of the key challenges for autonomous vehicles. Two kinds of sensors are commonly used for road detection: cameras and LIDARs. However, each of them suffers from some inherent drawbacks. Thus, sensor fusion is commonly used to combine the merits of these two kinds of sensors. Nevertheless, current sensor fusion methods are dominated by either cameras or LIDARs rather than making the best of both. In this paper, we extend the conditional random field (CRF) model and propose a novel hybrid CRF model to fuse the information from camera and LIDAR. After aligning the LIDAR points and pixels, we take the labels (either road or background) of the pixels and LIDAR points as random variables and infer the labels via minimization of a hybrid energy function. Boosted decision tree classifiers are learned to predict the unary potentials of both the pixels and LIDAR points. The pairwise \u2026",

Each vehicle entering the roundabout is randomly characterized by a predetermined exit with specified probability. Driver behavior at the roundabout entrance is randomly grouped into four categories based on space required to enter the roundabout. Three aspects of roundabout performance in particular have been studied. The first looks at overall throughput (the number of vehicles that navigate the roundabout in a given time). This is considered for different geometries, turning and arrival rates (vehicles arrive at random with a Poisson distribution, with parameter \u03bb\u2a7d0.5 in general for free flow).

A one-dimensional Gaussian Process (GP) regression with a non-stationary covariance function is used to distinguish the ground points or obstacles in each segment. The proposed approach splits a large-scale ground segmentation problem into many simple GP regression problems with lower complexity, and can then get a real-time performance while yielding acceptable ground segmentation results.

The method is able to reproduce many features of urban traffic, for which gap-acceptance models are less appropriate. Capacities of the minor-stream in a TWSC intersection are found to depend on flow rates of major-streams, also changes with flow rate ratio (FRR= flow rate of near lane: flow rate of far lane).
