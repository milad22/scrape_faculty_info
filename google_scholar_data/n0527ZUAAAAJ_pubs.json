            "Nucleic acid synthesis is spatially organized in many organisms. In bacteria, however, the spatial distribution of transcription remains obscure, owing largely to the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy (200\u2013300 nm). Here, we use photoactivated localization microscopy to localize individual molecules of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in Escherichia coli with a spatial resolution of \u223c40 nm. In cells growing rapidly in nutrient-rich media, we find that RNAP is organized in 2\u20138 bands. The band number scaled directly with cell size (and so with the chromosome number), and bands often contained clusters of >70 tightly packed RNAPs (possibly engaged on one long ribosomal RNA operon of 6000 bp) and clusters of such clusters (perhaps reflecting a structure like the eukaryotic nucleolus where many different ribosomal RNA operons are transcribed). In nutrient-poor media, RNAPs were located in only 1\u20132 bands \u2026",

To understand the process of epigenetic inheritance, or propagation of histones and histone variants, as nucleosomes are disassembled and reassembled in living eukaryotic cells, we have explored the feasibility of exploiting photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM). PALM of single molecules in living cells has the potential to reveal new concepts in cell biology, providing insights into stochastic variation in cellular states. However, thus far, its use has been limited to studies in bacteria or to processes occurring near the surface of eukaryotic cells. With PALM, one literally observes and \u2018counts\u2019 individual molecules in cells one-by-one and this allows the recording of images with a resolution higher than that determined by the diffraction of light (the so-called \u2026",

With the advent of super-resolution microscopy, colocalization analysis is getting closer to molecular resolution, bridging the gap to other technologies such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Among these novel microscopic techniques, single-molecule localization-based super-resolution methods offer the advantage of providing single-molecule coordinates that, rather than intensity information, can be used for colocalization analysis. This requires adapting the existing mathematical algorithms for localization microscopy data. Here, we introduce an algorithm for coordinate-based colocalization analysis which is suited for single-molecule super-resolution data. In addition, we present an experimental configuration for simultaneous dual-color \u2026",

Photoswitching of ordinary fluorophores such as ATTO520, ATTO565, ATTO655, ATTO680, or ATTO700, i.e. the reversible transition from a fluorescent to a nonfluorescent state in aqueous buffers exploits the formation of long-lived triplet radical anions through reaction with reducing agents such as \u03b2-mercaptoethylamine and repopulation of the singlet ground state by interaction with molecular oxygen. Thus, the time the different fluorophores reside in the fluorescent state can be easily adjusted by the excitation intensity and the concentration of the reducing agent. We demonstrate the potential of multicolor photoswitching microscopy with subdiffraction-resolution on cytoskeletal networks and molecular quantification of proteins in the inner mitochondrial \u2026",

The mechanisms underlying chromatin expansion in daughter cells remain largely unclear. Here, we describe the transient formation of nuclear actin filaments (F-actin) during mitotic exit. These nuclear F-actin structures assemble in daughter cell nuclei and undergo dynamic reorganization to promote nuclear protrusions and volume expansion throughout early G1 of the cell cycle. Specific inhibition of this nuclear F-actin assembly impaired nuclear expansion and chromatin decondensation after mitosis and during early mouse embryonic development. Biochemical screening for mitotic nuclear F-actin interactors identified the actin-disassembling factor cofilin-1.
