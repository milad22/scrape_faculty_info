            "While educational reforms in introductory physics are becoming more widespread, how these reforms are implemented is less well understood. This paper examines the variation in faculty practices surrounding the implementation of educational reform in introductory physics courses. Through observations of classroom practice, we find that professors\u2019 actual practices differ strikingly. We present a framework for describing and capturing instructional choices and resulting variations in enacted practices for faculty who are implementing Peer Instruction. Based on our observations, there are a variety of scientific practices that are supported and modeled in the use of Peer Instruction. In all of the classrooms studied, students were found trying out and applying new physical concepts and discussing physics with their peers. However, there were large discrepancies in students\u2019 opportunities to engage in formulating and \u2026",

We describe variations in classroom norms along three dimensions of classroom culture that are integral to Peer Instruction, emphasis on:(1) faculty-student collaboration,(2) student-student collaboration, and (3) sense-making vs answer-making. Based on interpretations by an observing researcher, we place three different PI classrooms along a continuum representing a set of possible norms. We then check these interpretations against students\u2019 perceptions of these environments from surveys collected at the end of the term. We find significant correspondence between the researchers\u2019 interpretations and students\u2019 perceptions of Peer Instruction in these environments.

The prevalence of infrared active phonons at low energy and their observed temperature dependence are highly unusual and indicative of exotic low-energy lattice dynamics. Eigenvector calculations indicate a mixing of librational and translational motion within each low-frequency IR mode. The role of the underconstrained structure in establishing the nature of these modes and the relationship between the IR spectra and the large negative thermal expansion in Z r W 2 O 8 are discussed.",

These rarely crossed streams of research leave open the possibility that the FCI may not be structurally valid across genders, particularly since many reported results come from calculus-based courses where 75% or more of the students are men. We examine the FCI considering both psychometrics and gender disaggregation (while acknowledging this as a binary simplification), and find several problematic questions whose removal decreases the apparent gender gap.
