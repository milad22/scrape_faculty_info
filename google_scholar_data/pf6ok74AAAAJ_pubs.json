            "Besides superconductivity, copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors are susceptible to other types of ordering. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and resonant elastic x-ray scattering measurements to establish the formation of charge ordering in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. Depending on the hole concentration, the charge ordering in this system occurs with the same period as those found in Y-based or La-based cuprates and displays the analogous competition with superconductivity. These results indicate the similarity of charge organization competing with superconductivity across different families of cuprates. We observed this charge ordering to leave a distinct electron-hole asymmetric signature (and a broad resonance centered at +20 milli\u2013electron volts) in spectroscopic measurements, indicating that it is likely related to the organization of holes in a doped Mott \u2026",

In copper oxides, doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state 6, which can be transformed into a high-temperature superconducting state with sufficient doping or by reducing the temperature. A long-standing issue has been the interplay between the pseudogap, which is generic to all hole-doped copper oxide superconductors, and stripes, whose static form occurs in only one family of copper oxides over a narrow range of the phase diagram 2, 7. Here we report observations of the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset of the pseudogap state in the high-temperature superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x, using spectroscopic mapping with a scanning tunnelling microscope. We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with the appearance of electronic patterns \u2026",

            "Charge-ordered ground states permeate the phenomenology of 3d-based transition metal oxides, and more generally represent a distinctive hallmark of strongly correlated states of matter. The recent discovery of charge order in various cuprate families has fuelled new interest into the role played by this incipient broken symmetry within the complex phase diagram of high-T c superconductors. Here, we use resonant X-ray scattering to resolve the main characteristics of the charge-modulated state in two cuprate families: Bi 2 Sr 2\u2212 x La x CuO 6+ \u03b4 (Bi2201) and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ y (YBCO). We detect no signatures of spatial modulations along the nodal direction in Bi2201, thus clarifying the inter-unit-cell momentum structure of charge order. We also resolve the intra-unit-cell symmetry of the charge-ordered state, which is revealed to be best represented by a bond order with modulated charges on the O-2p orbitals \u2026",

We use atomic scale imaging and spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope to examine the novel electronic states that emerge from the uranium f states in URu2Si2. We find that, as the temperature is lowered, partial screening of the f electrons\u2019 spins gives rise to a spatially modulated Kondo\u2013Fano resonance that is maximal between the surface U atoms. At T = 17.5 K, URu2Si2 is known to undergo a second-order phase transition from the Kondo lattice state into a phase with a hidden order parameter. From tunneling spectroscopy, we identify a spatially modulated, bias-asymmetric energy gap with a mean-field temperature dependence that develops in the hidden order state. Spectroscopic imaging further reveals a spatial correlation between the hidden order gap and the Kondo resonance \u2026",

In hole-doped (p-type) cuprates, a charge ordering (CO) instability competes with superconductivity inside the pseudogap state. We report resonant x-ray scattering measurements that demonstrate the presence of charge ordering in the n-type cuprate Nd2\u2013xCexCuO4 near optimal doping. We find that the CO in Nd2\u2013xCexCuO4 occurs with similar periodicity, and along the same direction, as in p-type cuprates. However, in contrast to the latter, the CO onset in Nd2\u2013xCexCuO4 is higher than the pseudogap temperature, and is in the temperature range where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are first detected. Our discovery opens a parallel path to the study of CO and its relationship to antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.",

Here we use spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunnelling microscope to detect the emergence of heavy excitations with lowering of temperature in a prototypical family of cerium-based heavy-fermion compounds.
