            "We argue that the distribution functions for quarks and gluons are computable at small x for sufficiently large nuclei, perhaps larger than can be physically realized. For such nuclei, we argue that weak coupling methods may be used. We show that the computation of the distribution functions can be recast as a many-body problem with a modified propagator, a coupling constant which depends on the multiplicity of particles per unit rapidity per unit area, and for non-Abelian gauge theories, some extra media-dependent vertices. We explicitly compute the distribution function for gluons to lowest order, and argue how they may be computed in higher order.",

This computation is valid to all orders in the density of partons per unit area, but to lowest order in \u03b1 s. The gluon distribution function is proportional to 1 x, and the effect of the finite density of partons is to modify the dependence on the transverse momentum for small transverse momenta.",

We argue that sufficiently large magnetic fields are created in heavy ion collisions so that the chiral magnetic effect causes preferential emission of charged particles along the direction of angular momentum. Since separation of charge is CP-odd, any observation of the chiral magnetic effect could provide a clear demonstration of the topological nature of the QCD vacuum. We give an estimate of the effect and conclude that it might be observed experimentally.",

This is a functional Fokker\u2013Planck equation in terms of a classical random color source, which represents the color charge density of the partons with large x. In the saturation regime of interest, the coefficients of this equation must be known to all orders in the source strength. In this first paper of a series of two, we carefully derive the evolution equation, via a matching between classical and quantum correlations, and set up the framework for the exact background source calculation of its coefficients. We address and clarify many of the subtleties and ambiguities which have plagued past attempts at an explicit construction of this equation. We also introduce the physical interpretation of the saturation regime at small x as a Color Glass Condensate. In the second paper we \u2026",
