            "We outline the construction of metastable de Sitter vacua of type IIB string theory. Our starting point is highly warped IIB compactifications with nontrivial NS and RR three-form fluxes. By incorporating known corrections to the superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation, one can make models with all moduli fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdS vacuum. Inclusion of a small number of D 3-branes in the resulting warped geometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable de Sitter ground state. The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is much greater than the cosmological time scale of 10 10 yr. We also prove, under certain conditions, that the lifetime of dS space in string theory will always be shorter than the recurrence time.",

At first sight a warped compactification geometry seems to produce a naturally flat inflaton potential, evading one well known difficulty of brane\u2013antibrane scenarios. Careful consideration of the closed string moduli reveals a further obstacle: superpotential stabilization of the compactification volume typically modifies the inflaton potential and renders it too steep for inflation. We discuss the non-generic conditions under which this problem does not arise. We conclude that brane inflation models can only work if restrictive assumptions about the method of volume stabilization, the warping of the internal space, and the source of inflationary energy are satisfied. We argue that this may not be a real problem, given the large range of available fluxes and background geometries in string theory.",

One considers the ADM mass equal to the central charge as a function of electric and magnetic charges and moduli and extremizes this function in the moduli space (a minimum corresponds to a fixed point of attraction). The extremal value of the square of the central charge provides the area of the horizon, which depends only on electric and magnetic charges. The doubling of unbroken supersymmetry at the fixed point of attraction for N= 2 black holes near the horizon is derived via conformal flatness of the Bertotti-Robinson-type geometry. These results provide an explicit model-independent expression for the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of N= 2 black holes which is manifestly duality invariant.

This is a property of a regular special geometry. We also study the critical points in all N \u2a7e 2 supersymmetric theories.

We accomplish the same goal by adding fluxes of gauge fields within the D7-branes, which induce a D-term potential in the effective 4D action. In this way we obtain dS space as a spontaneously broken vacuum from a purely supersymmetric 4D action.

            "There exists a widely held notion that gravitational effects can strongly violate global symmetries. If this is correct, it may lead to many important consequences. We argue, in particular, that nonperturbative gravitational effects in the axion theory lead to a strong violation of CP invariance unless they are suppressed by an extremely small factor g\u2272 10\u2212 82. One could hope that this problem disappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion field as a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor field. We show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protect the axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effects violating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e\u2212 S, where S is the action of a wormhole which may absorb the global charge. Unfortunately, in a wide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of \u2026",

            "In supersymmetric theories the mass of any state is bounded below by the values of some of its charges. The corresponding bounds in the case of Schwarzschild (M\u2265 0) and Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (M\u2265| q|) black holes are known to coincide with the requirement that naked singularities be absent. Here we investigate [U (1)] 2 charged dilaton black holes in this context. The extreme solutions are shown to saturate the supersymmetry bound of N= 4, d= 4 supergravity, or dimensionally reduced superstring theory. Specifically, we have shown that extreme dilaton black holes, with electric and magnetic charges, admit supercovariantly constant spinors. The supersymmetric positivity bound for dilaton black holes is given by M\u2265 1 2 (| Q|+| P|). This condition for dilaton black holes coincides with the cosmic censorship requirement that the singularities be hidden, as was the case for other asymptotically flat static black-hole \u2026",
