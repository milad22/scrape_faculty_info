            "Monodispersed nanoparticles of cobalt have been prepared by an original method using the decomposition under hydrogen of an organometallic precursor in the presence of a stabilizing polymer. Two colloids (Coll-I and Coll-II) have been obtained by changing the organometallic concentration in the polymer. Observation by high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) showed Co particles well isolated and regularly dispersed in the polymer with a very narrow size distribution centered around 1.5 nm (Coll-I) and 2 nm (Coll-II) diameter. These particles are superparamagnetic above the blocking temperature 9 K (Coll-I) and 13.5 K (Coll-II). The particle size deduced from the analyses of the magnetic susceptibilities and magnetization curves are consistent with those measured by HRTEM. Magnetization at 5 K seems to saturate in fields up to 5 T leading to an enhanced mean magnetic moment per \u2026",

Wide-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray spectroscopic studies provide precise information about the 3D connectivity and the local environment of the transition metal ions. Irradiating with blue light causes solid 1 to exhibit a spontaneous magnetization (Curie temperature = 25 K). The thermal reversibility is carefully studied and shows the long-time stability of the photoinduced state up to 100 K. Photoreversibility is also observed; i.e., the magnetization is induced by irradiation with light below 520 nm, while the magnetization is reduced by irradiation with light above 520 nm. The UV\u2212vis absorption spectrum after irradiation shows a decrease of the IT band and the \u2026",

WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scattering) and HREM (high-resolution electronic microscopy) were used to observe very precisely the structural changes occurring during the oxidation process. With cobalt particles a few nanometers large, air oxidation at room temperature results in a surface passivation. Consequently the particles show a composite structure with a metallic core surrounded by an oxide surface layer. Preliminary magnetic measurements reveal that unidirectional exchange anisotropy between the metallic ferromagnetic core and the antiferromagnetic oxide layer occurs below 130 K. ",

            "LaMnO3+\u03b4 samples with Mn4+ content up to 50% have been prepared by different methods. The structure of LaMnO3+\u03b4 changes from orthorhombic to cubic (via rhombohedral) with increase in the Mn4+ content. LaMnO3+\u03b4 samples containing greater than 20% Mn4+ are ferromagnetic and show resistivity maxima at a temperature Tt which is close to the ferromagnetic Curie temperature. The resistivity maximum is due to the occurrence of a metal-insulator transition. In samples heated to the same temperature, the value of Tt increases with % Mn4+. For a given sample, Tt increases with the temperature of heat treatment due to the increase in particle size. The onset of ferromagnetism in LaMnO3+\u03b4 accompanied by an insulator-metal transition is similar to that found in La1-xCaxMnO3 and La1-xSrxCoO3.",

            "Ultrafine cobalt particles have been reproducibly synthesized by decomposition of an organometallic precursor in the presence of a stabilizing polymer. The size of the stable monodisperse colloids thus obtained is seen to strongly depend on the nature of the polymer: around 4.2 nm diameter in polyphenylenoxide (PPO) and around 1.4 nm diameter in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Investigations by wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) give evidence for a size dependence of the structural organization, and hence for a close relationship between structure and synthesis conditions. Co\/PPO particles exhibit a hexagonal compact structure with the metal\u2013metal bond length of the bulk material while Co\/PVP ones display an original structure. We show that the unusual features of the experimental data in Co\/PVP clearly point to a nonperiodic polytetrahedral \u2026",
