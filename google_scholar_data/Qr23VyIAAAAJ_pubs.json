The normal-state resistivity anisotropy was obtained by employing both the Montgomery technique and direct measurements on samples cut along principal crystallographic directions. The ratio \u03b3 \u03c1= \u03c1 c\/\u03c1 a is about 4\u00b11 just above T c and becomes half of that at room temperature. The anisotropy of the upper critical field, \u03b3 H= H c 2, a b\/H c 2, c, as determined from specific-heat measurements close to T c is in the range of 2.1\u20132.6, depending on the criterion used. A comparable low anisotropy of the London penetration depth, \u03b3 \u03bb= \u03bb c\/\u03bb a b, was recorded from tunnel diode resonator measurements and found to persist deep into the superconducting state.

We show that H c 2\u2225 c (T) is mostly limited by the orbital pair breaking, whereas the shape of H c 2\u22a5 c (T) indicates strong paramagnetic Pauli limiting and the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state below T F~ 5 K.",

In Nd-1111, we find an upturn in \u03bb (T) upon cooling and attribute it to the paramagnetism of the Nd ions, similar to the case of the electron-doped cuprate Nd-Ce-Cu-O. After the correction for paramagnetism, the London penetration depth variation is found to follow a power-law behavior, \u0394 \u03bb L (T)\u221d T 2 at low temperatures. The same T 2 variation of \u03bb (T) was found in nonmagnetic La-1111 crystals. Analysis of the superfluid density and of penetration depth anisotropy over the full temperature range is consistent with two-gap superconductivity. Based on this and on our previous work, we conclude that both the RFeAsO (1111) and BaFe 2 As 2 (122) families of pnictide superconductors exhibit unconventional two-gap superconductivity.",

We report the discovery of spin-triplet superconductivity in UTe2, featuring a transition temperature of 1.6 kelvin and a very large and anisotropic upper critical field exceeding 40 teslas. This superconducting phase stability suggests that UTe2 is related to ferromagnetic superconductors such as UGe2, URhGe, and UCoGe. However, the lack of magnetic order and the observation of quantum critical scaling place UTe2 at the paramagnetic end of this ferromagnetic superconductor series. A large intrinsic zero-temperature reservoir of ungapped fermions indicates a highly unconventional type of superconducting pairing.",
