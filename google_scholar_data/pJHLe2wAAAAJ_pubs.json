            "We present results on the chiral and deconfinement properties of the QCD transition at finite temperature. Calculations are performed with 2+ 1 flavors of quarks using the p4, asqtad, and HISQ\/tree actions. Lattices with temporal extent N \u03c4= 6, 8, and 12 are used to understand and control discretization errors and to reliably extrapolate estimates obtained at finite lattice spacings to the continuum limit. The chiral transition temperature is defined in terms of the phase transition in a theory with two massless flavors and analyzed using O (N) scaling fits to the chiral condensate and susceptibility. We find consistent estimates from the HISQ\/tree and asqtad actions and our main result is T c= 154\u00b19 MeV.",

Calculations have been performed with two different improved staggered fermion actions, the asqtad and p4 actions. Overall, we find good agreement between results obtained with these two O (a 2) improved staggered fermion discretization schemes. A comparison with earlier calculations on coarser lattices is performed to quantify systematic errors in current studies of the equation of state. We also present results for observables that are sensitive to deconfining and chiral aspects of the QCD transition on N \u03c4= 6 and 8 lattices. We find that deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration happen in the same narrow temperature interval. In an appendix we present a simple parametrization of the equation of state that can easily be \u2026",

We compare our results with previous calculations and provide an analytic parameterization of the pressure, from which other thermodynamic quantities can be calculated, for use in phenomenology. We show that the energy density in the crossover region, 145 MeV\u2264 T\u2264 163 MeV, defined by the chiral transition, is \u03b5 c=(0.18\u20130.5) GeV\/fm 3, ie,(1.2\u20133.1) \u03b5 nuclear.
