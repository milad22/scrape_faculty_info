Simultaneous measurement of P t and P \u2113 in a polarimeter provides good control of the systematic uncertainty.

Such a particle A\u2032 can be produced in electron-nucleus fixed-target scattering and then decay to an e+ e\u2212 pair, producing a narrow resonance in the QED trident spectrum. Using APEX test run data, we searched in the mass range 175\u2013250 MeV, found no evidence for an A\u2032\u2192 e+ e\u2212 reaction, and set an upper limit of \u03b1\u2032\/\u03b1\u2243 10\u2212 6.

These measurements were performed using a 5.7 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam and a polarized He 3 target. The results for A 1 n and g 1 n at x= 0.33 are consistent with previous world data and, at the two higher-x points, have improved the precision of the world data by about an order of magnitude. The new A 1 n data show a zero crossing around x= 0.47 and the value at x= 0.60 is significantly positive. These results agree with a next-to-leading-order QCD analysis of previous world data. The trend of data at high x agrees with constituent quark model predictions but disagrees with that from leading-order perturbative QCD (PQCD) assuming hadron helicity \u2026",
