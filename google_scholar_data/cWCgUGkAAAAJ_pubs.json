The measurements, using time-resolved x-ray spectroscopy on solid glass targets coated with varying thicknesses of plastic, provide absolute measurements of the onset times of the resonance x-ray lines of silicon. From these measurements, the scaling of the instantaneous mass-ablation rate with absorbed intensity is obtained for times before and after the peak of the laser pulse. The observed large burnthrough depths and early onsets of the x-ray lines are explained by carrying out detailed hydrodynamic-code simulations for the range of the estimated laser-intensity distribution on target which is obtained from the superposition of the equivalent target-plane intensity distribution of a single beam.

            "This is a review of some recent development in femtosecond filamentation science with emphasis on our collective work. Previously reviewed work in the field will not be discussed. We thus start with a very brief description of the fundamental physics of single filamentation of powerful femtosecond laser pulses in air. Intensity clamping is emphasized. One consequence is that the peak intensity inside one or more filaments would not increase significantly even if one focuses the pulse at very high peak power even up to the peta-watt level. Another is that the clamped intensity is independent of pressure. One interesting outcome of the high intensity inside a filament is filament fusion which comes from the nonlinear change of index of refraction inside the filament leading to cross beam focusing. Because of the high intensity inside the filament, one can envisage nonlinear phenomena taking place inside a \u2026",

Refractive-index differentials (\u0394n>10^-2) were measured through interferometric microscopy and are higher than the typical values reported for oxide glasses. The dependence of the index differential on the peak intensity reveals the nonlinear nature of the photosensitivity in arsenic trisulfide below its bandgap energy, and the refractive-index change is correlated to the photoinduced structural changes inferred by Raman spectroscopy data. A free-electron model to predict the parametric dependence of \u0394n is proposed.",
