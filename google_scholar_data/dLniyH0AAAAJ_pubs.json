            "We present the results of two exploratory parsimony analyses of DNA sequences from 475 and 499 species of seed plants, respectively, representing all major taxonomic groups. The data are exclusively from the chloroplast gene rbcL, which codes for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase\/oxygenase (RuBisCO or RuBPCase). We used two different state-transformation assumptions resulting in two sets of cladograms: (i) equal-weighting for the 499-taxon analysis; and (ii) a procedure that differentially weights transversions over transitions within characters and codon positions among characters for the 475-taxon analysis. The degree of congruence between these results and other molecular, as well as morphological, cladistic studies indicates that rbcL sequence variation contains historical evidence appropriate for phylogenetic analysis at this taxonomic level of sampling.

Ambiguities can be uncovered by resampling, but existing neighbor-joining programs may give misleading bootstrap frequencies because they do not suppress zero-length branches and\/or are sensitive to the order of terminals in the data. A new procedure, parsimony jackknifing, overcomes these problems while running hundreds of times faster than existing programs for neighbor-joining bootstrapping. For analysis of large matrices, parsimony jackknifing is hundreds of thousands of times faster than extensive branch-swapping, yet is better able to screen out poorly-supported groups.",

            "Polyploidy has long been recognized as a major force in angiosperm evolution. Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also suggest several ancient genome\u2010doubling events. These include ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events in basal angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed paleohexaploid event that may have occurred close to the eudicot divergence. However, there is currently no evidence for WGD in Amborella, the putative sister species to other extant angiosperms. The question is no longer \u201cWhat proportion of angiosperms are polyploid?\u201d, but \u201cHow many episodes of polyploidy characterize any given lineage?\u201d New algorithms provide promise that ancestral genomes can be reconstructed for deep divergences (e.g., it may be possible to reconstruct the ancestral eudicot or even the ancestral angiosperm genome).

We report here the genome sequence of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii (Selaginella), the first nonseed vascular plant genome reported. By comparing gene content in evolutionarily diverse taxa, we found that the transition from a gametophyte- to a sporophyte-dominated life cycle required far fewer new genes than the transition from a nonseed vascular to a flowering plant, whereas secondary metabolic genes expanded extensively and in parallel in the lycophyte and angiosperm lineages. Selaginella differs in posttranscriptional gene regulation, including small RNA regulation of repetitive elements, an absence of the trans-acting small interfering RNA pathway, and extensive RNA editing of organellar genes.",

We generated a high-quality draft genome of the species Coffea canephora, which displays a conserved chromosomal gene order among asterid angiosperms. Although it shows no sign of the whole-genome triplication identified in Solanaceae species such as tomato, the genome includes several species-specific gene family expansions, among them N-methyltransferases (NMTs) involved in caffeine production, defense-related genes, and alkaloid and flavonoid enzymes involved in secondary compound synthesis. Comparative analyses of caffeine NMTs demonstrate that these genes expanded through sequential tandem duplications independently of genes from cacao and tea, suggesting that caffeine in eudicots is of polyphyletic origin.",

            "The carnivorous habit in flowering plants represents a grade of structural organization. Different morphological features associated with the attraction, trapping, and digestion of prey characterize a diversity of specialized forms, including the familiar pitcher and flypaper traps. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequence data from the plastic rbcL gene indicates that both carnivory and stereotyped trap forms have arisen independently in different lineages of angiosperms. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that flypaper traps share close common ancestry with all other trap forms. Recognition of these patterns of diversification may provide ideal, naturally occurring systems for studies of developmental processes underlying macromorphological evolution in angiosperms.",

            "Darwin famously characterized the rapid rise and early diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) in the fossil record as an \u201cabominable mystery.\u201d Identifying genomic changes that accompanied the origin of angiosperms is key to unraveling the molecular basis of biological innovations that contributed to their geologically near-instantaneous rise to ecological dominance.Amborella trichopoda, an understory shrub endemic to New Caledonia, is the sole surviving sister species of all other living flowering plants (angiosperms). The Amborella genome provides an exceptional reference for inferring features of the first flowering plants and identifies an ancient angiosperm-wide whole-genome duplication (red star). Amborella flowers have spirally arranged tepals, unfused carpels (female; shown), and laminar stamens.Amborella trichopoda, an understory shrub endemic to New Caledonia, is the sole \u2026",

            "Total genomic DNAs from 61 accessions of 40 species of Gossypium were surveyed for restriction site variation in the maternally inherited plastid genome using 25 endonucleases. One hundred thirty-five of the 202 restriction site variants detected were potentially synapomorphous and served as binary characters for phylogeny estimation. Two cladistic methods were employed: Wagner parsimony analysis, which resulted in four equally most-parsimonious topologies requiring 161 steps (CI = 0.84), and a novel character-state weighting approach that models the relative probabilities of restriction site losses versus gains. This latter technique, which is theoretically preferable to both Dollo and Wagner parsimony analysis in that it optimizes against parallel site gains, resulted in two optimal phylogenetic estimates (a subset of the Wagner topologies) that differ only in the placement of G. longicalyx. In general, maternal \u2026",
