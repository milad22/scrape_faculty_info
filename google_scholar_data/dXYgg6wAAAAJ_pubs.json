            "The introduction of disulfide bonds into proteins creates additional mechanical barriers and limits the unfolded contour length (i.e., the maximal extension) measured by single-molecule force spectroscopy. Here, we engineer single disulfide bonds into four different locations of the human cardiac titin module (I27) to control the contour length while keeping the distance to the transition state unchanged. This enables the study of several biologically important parameters. First, we are able to precisely determine the end-to-end length of the transition state before unfolding (53 \u00c5), which is longer than the end-to-end length of the protein obtained from NMR spectroscopy (43 \u00c5). Second, the measured contour length per amino acid from five different methods (4.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5) is longer than the end-to-end length obtained from the crystal structure (3.6 \u00c5). Our measurement of the contour length takes into account all the internal \u2026",

However, correlations between these domains remain an issue in interpreting force spectroscopy data, particularly during protein folding. Here we first show that force-clamp spectroscopy is a sensitive technique that provides a molecular fingerprint based on the unfolding step size of four single-monomer proteins. We then measure the force-dependent unfolding rate kinetics of ubiquitin and I27 monomers and find a good agreement with the data obtained for the respective polyproteins over a wide range of forces, in support of the Markovian hypothesis. Moreover, with a large statistical ensemble at a single force, we show that ubiquitin monomers also exhibit a broad distribution of unfolding times as a signature of disorder in the folded protein landscape.

The structural fluctuations that give rise to this distribution reveal the architecture of the protein\u2019s energy landscape. Following models of glassy dynamics, this complex kinetics implies large fluctuations in the energies of the folded protein, characterized by an exponential distribution with a width of 5\u201310k B T.

This paper studies through experiment, theory and simulation, the forces that particles exert upon one another in such a jammed state. Confocal microscopy of a compressed polydisperse emulsion provides a direct 3D measurement of the dispersed phase morphology within the bulk of the sample. This allows the determination of the probability distribution of interdroplet forces, P(f) where f is the magnitude of the force, from local droplet deformations. In parallel, the simplest form of the Boltzmann equation for the probability of force distributions predicts P(f) to be of the form e\u2212f\/p, where p is proportional to the mean force  for large forces.

Owing to recent advances in single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy, we are now able to probe the structure and dynamics of the small protein ubiquitin by measuring its length and mechanical stability during each stage of folding. Here, we discover that upon hydrophobic collapse, the protein rapidly selects a subset of minimum energy structures that are mechanically weak and essential precursors of the native fold. From this much reduced ensemble, the native state is acquired through a barrier-limited transition. Our results support the validity of statistical mechanics models in \u2026",

            "The specificity and thermal reversibility of DNA interactions have enabled the self-assembly of crystal structures, self-replicating materials and colloidal molecules. Grafting DNA onto liquid interfaces of emulsions leads to exciting new architectural possibilities due to the mobility of the DNA ligands and the patches they form between bound droplets. Here we show that the size and number of these adhesion patches (valency) can be controlled. Valence 2 leads to flexible polymers of emulsion droplets, while valence above 4 leads to rigid droplet networks. A simple thermodynamic model quantitatively describes the increase in the patch size with droplet radii, DNA concentration and the stiffness of the tether to the sticky-end. The patches are formed between droplets with complementary DNA strands or alternatively with complementary colloidal nanoparticles to mediate DNA binding between droplets. This emulsion \u2026",
