            "Effective interresidue contact energies for proteins in solution are estimated from the numbers of residue-residue contacts observed in crystal structures of globular proteins by means of the quasi-chemical approximation with an approximate treatment of the effects of chain connectivity. Employing a lattice model, each residueof a protein is assumed to occupy a site in a lattice and vacant sites are regarded to be occupied by an effective solvent molecule whose size is equal to the average size of a residue. A basic assumption is that the average characteristics of residue-residuecontacts formed in a large numberof protein crystal structures reflect actual differences of interactions among residues, as if there were no significant contribution from the specific amino acid sequence in each protein as well as intraresidue and short-range interactions. Then, taking account of theeffects of the chain connectivity only as \u2026",

This scalar model simply investigates the magnitudes of motion of individual residues in the structure. To use the elastic model approach further for developing the details of protein mechanisms, it becomes essential to expand this model to include the added details of the directions of individual residue fluctuations. In this paper a new tool is presented for this purpose and applied to the retinol-binding protein, which indicates enhanced flexibility in the region of entry to the ligand binding site and for the portion of the protein binding to its carrier protein.",

An additional repulsive packing energy term, operative at higher densities to prevent overpacking, has also been estimated for all 20 amino acids as a function of the number of contacting residues, based on their observed distributions. The two terms of opposite sign are intended to be used together to provide an estimate of the overall energies of inter-residue interactions in simplified proteins without atomic details. To overcome the problem of how to utilize the many homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank, a new scheme has been devised to assign different weights to each protein, based on similarities among amino acid sequences.

            "Revised Manuscript Received December 11, 1989 abstract: A new method is presented to examine the complete range of folded topologies accessible in the compact state of globular proteins. The procedure is to generate all conformations, with volume exclusion, upon a lattice in a space restricted to the individual protein\u2019s known compact conformational space. Using one lattice point per residue, we find 102\u2014104 possible compact conformations for the five small globular proteins studied. Subsequently, these conformations are evaluated in terms of residue-specific, pairwise contact energies that favor nonbonded, hydrophobic interactions. Native structures for the five proteins are always found within the best2% of all conformersgenerated. This novel method is simple and general and can be used todetermine a small group of most favorable overall arrangements for the folding of specific amino acid sequences \u2026",

            "The motions of large systems such as the ribosome are not fully accessible with conventional molecular simulations. A coarse-grained, less-than-atomic-detail model such as the anisotropic network model (ANM) is a convenient informative tool to study the cooperative motions of the ribosome. The motions of the small 30S subunit, the larger 50S subunit, and the entire 70S assembly of the two subunits have been analyzed using ANM. The lowest frequency collective modes predicted by ANM show that the 50S subunit and 30S subunit are strongly anti-correlated in the motion of the 70S assembly. A ratchet-like motion is observed that corresponds well to the experimentally reported ratchet motion. Other slow modes are also examined because of their potential links to the translocation steps in the ribosome. We identify several modes that may facilitate the E-tRNA exiting from the assembly.

This model is particularly suitable for elucidating the global dynamic characteristics of large proteins such as the presently investigated heterodimeric RT comprising a total of 982 residues. Local packing density and coordination order of amino acid residues is inspected by the GNM to determine the type and range of motions, both at the residue level and on a global scale, such as the correlated movements of entire subdomains. Of the two subunits, p66 and p51, forming the RT, only p66 has a DNA-binding cleft and a functional polymerase active site. This difference in the structure of the two subunits is shown here to be reflected in their dynamic characteristics: only p66 has the potential to undergo large-scale \u2026",
