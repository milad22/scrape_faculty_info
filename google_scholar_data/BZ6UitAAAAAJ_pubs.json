The derivation uses the general coupling of the Yang-Mills matter system to n = 1 supergravity. As illustrative examples of this framework we exhibit realistic models of supersymmetric QED and of the electroweak theory with supersymmetry breaking induced by purely gravitational effects.",

One considers the ADM mass equal to the central charge as a function of electric and magnetic charges and moduli and extremizes this function in the moduli space (a minimum corresponds to a fixed point of attraction). The extremal value of the square of the central charge provides the area of the horizon, which depends only on electric and magnetic charges. The doubling of unbroken supersymmetry at the fixed point of attraction for N= 2 black holes near the horizon is derived via conformal flatness of the Bertotti-Robinson-type geometry. These results provide an explicit model-independent expression for the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of N= 2 black holes which is manifestly duality invariant.

This is the basic step towards the construction of their moduli space. We give an explicit and general algorithm to convert the effective Lagrangian for the type IIA into that of type IIB superstring defined by the same (2,2) superconformal system (and vice versa). This map converts Kahler manifolds into quaternionic ones (and quaternionic into Kahlerian ones) and has a deep geometrical meaning. The relationship with the theory of normal quaternionic manifolds (and algebras), as well as with Jordan algebras, is outlined. It turns out that only a restricted class of quarternionic geometries is allowed in the string case.
