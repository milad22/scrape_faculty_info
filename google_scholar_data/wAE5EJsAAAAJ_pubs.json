            "Background: Underground miners exposed to high levels of radon have an excess risk of lung cancer. Residential exposure to radon is at much lower levels, and the risk of lung cancer with residential exposure is less clear. We conducted a systematic analysis of pooled data from all North American residential radon studies. Methods: The pooling project included original data from 7 North American case-control studies, all of which used long-term \u03b1-track detectors to assess residential radon concentrations. A total of 3662 cases and 4966 controls were retained for the analysis. We used conditional likelihood regression to estimate the excess risk of lung cancer. Results: Odds ratios (ORs) for lung cancer increased with residential radon concentration. The estimated OR after exposure to radon at a concentration of 100 Bq\/m\u00b3 in the exposure time window 5 to 30 years before the index date was 1.11 (95% confidence \u2026",

            "Cohort studies have consistently shown underground miners exposed to high levels of radon to be at excess risk of lung cancer, and extrapolations based on those results indicate that residential radon may be responsible for nearly 10\u201315% of all lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. However, case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer have provided ambiguous evidence of radon lung cancer risks. Regardless, alpha-particle emissions from the short-lived radioactive radon decay products can damage cellular DNA. The possibility that a demonstrated lung carcinogen may be present in large numbers of homes raises a serious public health concern. Thus, a systematic analysis of pooled data from all North American residential radon studies was undertaken to provide a more direct characterization of the public health risk posed by prolonged radon exposure.

In some areas, outdoor concentrations exceed the national average indoor radon concentration.

Outdoor radon exposure in this region can be a substantial fraction of an individual's total radon exposure and is highly variable across the population.

It was observed that:(1) significant radon variations can occur on a spatial scale as small as a single floor;(2) radon measurements that integrate for periods less than 3 mo are reliable only to within a factor of 2 or more; and (3) contemporary, short-term measurements within existing structures may not accurately reflect past radon concentrations. Two-hundred forty-three occupied houses located in 40 towns were monitored for at least 1 y using alpha-track detectors. If lifetime radon exposure estimates need to be determined accurately, then long-term, integrating radon detectors should be placed in several rooms of each house. In radon atmospheres that may not be stable for long periods of time, it is suggested that multiple, year-long measurements or surface alpha activity measurements in combination with year-long alpha-track measurements are needed for an accurate lifetime radon assessment.",

            "The most direct way to derive risk estimates for residential radon progeny exposure is through epidemiologic studies that examine the association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer. However, the National Research Council concluded that the inconsistency among prior residential radon case-control studies was largely a consequence of errors in radon dosimetry. This paper examines the impact of applying various epidemiologic dosimetry models for radon exposure assessment using a common data set from the Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study (IRLCS). The IRLCS uniquely combined enhanced dosimetric techniques, individual mobility assessment, and expert histologic review to examine the relationship between cumulative radon exposure, smoking, and lung cancer. The a priori defined IRLCS radon-exposure model produced higher odds ratios than those methodologies that did not link the \u2026",

Year-long measurements of contemporary radon concentrations have been the \u201cgold standard\u201d for epidemiologists trying to reconstruct past radon exposures and for homeowners trying to estimate future radon exposure. Random variations and persistent temporal trends can affect remedial action decisions and risk coefficients derived from epidemiological studies. Temporal fluctuations are possible when changes occur in a home\u2019s structure, climate, environment, or occupants. The annual-average temporal radon behavior was studied at 196 sites in 98 Minnesota houses. Seventeen hundred year-long indoor radon measurements were made from 1983 to 2000 to determine year-to-year radon fluctuations and long-term temporal trends. Ten year-long measurements over a span of 13 years were made at \u2026",
