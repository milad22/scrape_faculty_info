            "This document a outlines a set of simplified models for dark matter and its interactions with Standard Model particles. It is intended to summarize the main characteristics that these simplified models have when applied to dark matter searches at the LHC, and to provide a number of useful expressions for reference. The list of models includes both s-channel and t-channel scenarios. For s-channel, spin-0 and spin-1 mediations are discussed, and also realizations where the Higgs particle provides a portal between the dark and visible sectors. The guiding principles underpinning the proposed simplified models are spelled out, and some suggestions for implementation are presented.",

The background magnetic geometry is static and axisymmetric and all dependence of the Lagrangian on dynamical variables is in the Hamiltonian or in free field terms. Equations for the fields are given by functional derivatives. The symmetry through the Hamiltonian with time and toroidal angle invariance of the geometry lead to energy and toroidal momentum conservation. In various levels of ordering against fluctuation amplitude, energetic consistency is exact. The role of this in the underpinning of conservation laws is emphasized. Local transport equations for the vorticity, toroidal momentum, and energy are derived. In particular, the momentum equation is shown for any form of Hamiltonian to be well behaved and to relax to its magnetohydrodynamic form when long wavelength approximations are taken in the Hamiltonian.

At tree level sterile neutrinos manifest themselves via non-unitarity of the PMNS matrix and at one-loop level they modify the oblique radiative corrections. We derive explicit formulae for the S, T, U parameters in terms of the neutrino masses and mixings and perform a numerical fit to the electro-weak observables. We find regions of parameter space with a sizable active-sterile mixing which provide a better over-all fit compared to the case where the mixing is negligible. Specifically we find improvements of the invisible Z-decay width, the charged-to-neutral-current ratio for neutrino scattering experiments and of the deviation of the W boson mass from the theoretical expectation.",

            "A sharp and spatially extended peak in an astrophysical gamma ray spectrum would provide very strong evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), given that there are no known astrophysical processes that could mimic such a signal. From the particle physics perspective, perhaps the simplest explanation for a gamma ray peak is internal bremsstrahlung in DM annihilation through a charged -channel mediator  close in mass to the DM particle . Since DM annihilation to quarks is already tightly constrained in this scenario, we focus here on the leptophilic case. We compute the electromagnetic anapole and dipole moments that DM acquires at 1-loop, and we find an interesting enhancement of these moments if the DM particle and the mediator are close in mass. We constrain the DM anapole and dipole moments using direct detection data, and then translate these limits into bounds on the DM annihilation \u2026",

All fermion mass terms arise therefore from vacuum expectation values of suitable scalars times some Yukawa couplings. This leads to interesting consequences for model building, neutrino mass phenomenology and the Dark Matter abundance. In the context of the inverse seesaw we find a favoured scenario with heavy pseudo-Dirac sterile neutrinos at the TeV scale, which in the conformal framework conspire with the electro-weak scale to generate keV scale warm Dark Matter.
