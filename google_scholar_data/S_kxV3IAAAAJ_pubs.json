Using atomic force microscopy, we show that the graphene adheres to the substrate surface and can substantially deform the substrate, with larger graphene thicknesses creating greater deformations. We use linear elasticity theory to model the deformations of the composite graphene-substrate system. We compare experiment and theory, and thereby extract information about graphene\u2019s bending rigidity, adhesion, critical stress for interlayer sliding, and sample-dependent tension.",

We focus on deformed square lattices as the simplest Maxwell lattices, characterized by equal numbers of constraints and degrees of freedom, with this property. The Weyl points appear at the origin of the Brillouin zone along directions with vanishing sound speed and move away to the zone edge (or return to the origin) where they annihilate.

Of particular interest are systems near the point of mechanical instability, which recently have been shown to distribute force and motion in robust ways determined by a nontrivial topological state. Here we discuss the classification of and propose a design principle for mechanical metamaterials that can be easily and reversibly transformed between states with dramatically different mechanical and acoustic properties via a soft strain. Remarkably, despite the low energetic cost of this transition, quantities such as the edge stiffness and speed of sound can change by orders of magnitude.

Memory effects in magnets, spin glasses, charge density waves, and dilute colloidal suspensions are discussed in relation to the onset of plastic yielding in crystals. Dislocation avalanches and complex dislocation tangles are discussed via a brief introduction to the renormalization group and scaling. Analogies to emergent scale invariance in fracture, jamming, coarsening, and a variety of depinning transitions are explored.

However, it is a grand challenge to self-assemble open structures at the colloidal scale, where short-range interactions and low coordination number can leave them mechanically unstable. In this paper we discuss the self-assembly of three-dimensional open structures using triblock Janus particles, which have two large attractive patches that can form multiple bonds, separated by a band with purely hard-sphere repulsion. Such surface patterning leads to open structures that are stabilized by orientational entropy (in an order-by-disorder effect) and selected over close-packed structures by vibrational entropy. For different patch sizes the particles can form into either tetrahedral or octahedral structural motifs \u2026",

Recently, Kane and Lubensky showed that lattices at the point of marginal mechanical stability (Maxwell lattices) possess a topological invariant that describes the distribution of floppy, zero-energy edge modes. Here, we show that applying force at a point in the bulk of these lattices generates a directional mechanical response, in which stress or strain is induced only on one side of the force. This provides both a bulk metric for mechanical polarization and a design principle to convey stresses and strains towards or away from parts of the structure. We also characterize the effects of removing bonds on the material's structure and floppy modes, establishing a relationship between edge modes and bulk response.",

Here we discuss RP with structural correlations, an effect ignored in classical theories albeit relevant to many liquid-to-amorphous-solid transitions, such as colloidal gelation, which are due to attractive interactions and aggregation. Using a lattice model, we show that structural correlations shift RP to lower volume fractions. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that increasing attraction in colloidal gelation increases structural correlation and thus lowers the RP transition, agreeing with experiments. Hence, the emergence of rigidity at colloidal gelation can be understood as a RP transition, but occurs at volume fractions far below values predicted by the classical RP, due to attractive interactions which induce structural correlation.",

We studied a desert snake, Chionactis occipitalis, which uses a stereotyped head-to-tail traveling wave to move quickly on homogeneous sand. In laboratory experiments, we challenged snakes to move across a uniform substrate and through a regular array of force-sensitive posts.

In contrast to linear models that display diverging length scales at a critical point, this phenomenon occurs over a large parameter range, and is expected to be observed in biopolymer networks and porous artificial materials. This mixture of fiber alignment and fracture leads to massively greater energy dissipation and to fracture avalanche statistics distinct from those present in linear models.",
