Both the Sommerfeld coefficient (\u03b3\u2248 103 mJ mol\u2212 1 K\u2212 2) and the Pauli susceptibility (\u03c7\u2248 4\u00d7 10\u2212 4) are strongly enhanced, which confirm the existence of heavy quasiparticles inferred from previous de Haas\u2013van Alphen and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. We discuss this large enhancement using a Gutzwiller slave-boson mean-field calculation, which shows the proximity of KFe 2 As 2 to an orbital-selective Mott transition. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the thermal expansion provide strong experimental evidence for the existence of a coherence-incoherence crossover, similar to what is found in heavy fermion and ruthenate compounds, due to Hund\u2019s coupling between orbitals.",

The bonding character and electron transfer between the metal adatoms and graphene were analyzed using the recently developed quasi-atomic minimal basis set orbitals (QUAMBOs) approach. The calculations showed that the interaction between alkali-metal adatoms and graphene is ionic and has minimal effects on the lattice and electronic states of the graphene layer, in agreement with previous calculations. For group-III metal adatom adsorptions, mixed covalent and ionic bonding is demonstrated. In comparison, 3 d-transition-metal adsorption on graphene exhibits strong covalent bonding with graphene. The majority of the contributions to the covalent bonds are from strong hybridization between the d x 2\u2212 y 2 and d yz orbitals of the 3 d \u2026",

The calculations cover alkali metals, sp-simple metals, 3d and group 10 transition metals, noble metals, as well as rare earth metals. The correlation between the adatom adsorption properties and the growth morphology of the metals on graphene is also investigated. We show that the growth morphology is related to the ratio of the metal adsorption energy to its bulk cohesive energy (Ea\/Ec) and the diffusion barrier (\u0394E) of the metal adatom on graphene. Charge transfer, electric dipole and magnetic moments, and graphene lattice distortion induced by metal adsorption would also affect the growth morphologies of the metal islands. We also show that most of the metal nanostructures on graphene would be thermally stable against coarsening.",

With the \u201corder mining\u201d idea for structurally disordered systems, the method can detect the presence of any type of local order in the system and can quantify the structural similarity between a given set of templates and the aligned clusters in a systematic and unbiased manner. Moreover, population analysis can also be carried out for various types of clusters in the system. The advantages of the method in comparison with other previously developed analysis methods are illustrated by performing the structural analysis for four prototype systems (ie, pure Al, pure Zr, Zr 35 Cu 65, and Zr 36 Ni 64). The results show that the cluster alignment method can identify various types of short-range orders (SROs) in these systems correctly while some of these SROs are difficult to capture by most \u2026",

The adsorption energies and diffusion barriers of Nd and Gd on graphene are found to be larger than those of Eu and Yb. Comparison with scanning tunneling microscopy experiments for Gd and Eu epitaxially grown on graphene confirms these calculated adsorption and barrier differences, since fractal-like islands are observed for Gd and flat-topped crystalline islands for Eu.
