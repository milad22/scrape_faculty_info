            "We present NMR data in the normal and superconducting states of CeCoIn 5 for fields close to H c 2 (0)= 11.8 T in the a b plane. Recent experiments identified a first-order transition from the normal to superconducting state for H> 10.5 T, and a new thermodynamic phase below 290 mK within the superconducting state. We find that the Knight shifts of the In (1), In (2), and the Co are discontinuous across the first-order transition and the magnetic linewidths increase dramatically. The broadening differs for the three sites, unlike the expectation for an Abrikosov vortex lattice, and suggests the presence of static spin moments in the vortex cores. In the low-temperature and high-field phase, the broad NMR lineshapes suggest ordered local moments, rather than a long-wavelength quasiparticle spin density modulation expected for an FFLO phase.",

We present a general approach and use it to investigate the influence of the difference between the shapes and the areas of the two Fermi surfaces on the phase diagram. In particular, we determine the conditions for the coexistence of SC and SDW orders at different temperatures and dopings. We argue that a conventional s-wave SC order coexists with SDW order only at very low T and in a very tiny range of parameters. An extended s-wave superconductivity, for which SC gap changes sign between the two bands, coexists with antiferromagnetic SDW over a much wider range of parameters and temperatures but even for this SC order the regions of SDW and SC can still be separated by a first-order transition. We show that the coexistence \u2026",

We argue that the nodes in the gap emerge without a phase transition as the tendency toward a spin-density-wave order gets weaker.
