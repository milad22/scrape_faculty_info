            "The presence of an intermittent layer at the base of Earth9s mantle with a maximum thickness near 40 kilometers and a compressional wave velocity depressed by \u223c10 percent compared with that of the overlying mantle is most simply explained as the result of partial melt at this depth. Both the sharp upper boundary of this layer (<10 kilometers wide) and the apparent correlation with deep mantle upwelling are consistent with the presence of liquid in the lowermost mantle, implying that the bottom of the thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle may lie above its eutectic temperature. Such a partially molten zone would be expected to have enhanced thermal and chemical transport properties and may provide constraints on the geotherm and lateral variations in lowermost mantle temperature or mineralogy.",

The melting temperature of iron at the pressure of the core-mantle boundary (136 gigapascals) is 4800 \u00b1 200 K. whereas at the inner core-outer core boundary (330 gigapascals), it is 7600 \u00b1 500 K. Corrected for melting point depression resulting from the presence of impurities, a melting temperature for iron-rich alloy of 6600 K at the inner core-outer core boundary and a maximum temperature of 6900 K at Earth9s center are inferred. This latter value is the first experimental upper bound on the temperature at Earth9s center, and these results imply that the temperature of the lower mantle is significantly less than that of the outer core.",

The spectra are consistent with gradual, pressure-induced increases in the coordination numbers of silicon and aluminum. A variety of coordination environments, from sixfold to fourfold, appears to be present at pressures as high as about 40 gigapascals. This apparent change in coordination is not quenchable at room temperature: on decompression, the glasses return to tetrahedral coordination. This continuous and reversible coordination change in amorphous silicates explains the lack of observation of coordination changes in silicate glasses quenched from high pressure, the shallow melting slopes observed for mantle silicates at high pressures, and \u2026",

We reanalyzed Apollo lunar seismograms using array-processing methods to search for the presence of reflected and converted seismic energy from the core. Our results suggest the presence of a solid inner and fluid outer core, overlain by a partially molten boundary layer. The relative sizes of the inner and outer core suggest that the core is ~60% liquid by volume. Based on phase diagrams of iron alloys and the presence of partial melt, the core probably contains less than 6 weight % of lighter alloying components, which is consistent with a volatile-depleted interior.",

Regassing of the planet occurs via subduction: Cold slabs are likely particularly efficient at transporting hydrogen to depth within the planet. Marked changes in hydrogen cycling have taken place throughout Earth's history: Evidence of hydrated ultramafic melts in the Archean and probable hydrogen retention within a Hadean magma ocean indicate that early in its history, the deep Earth was substantially wetter.

This discontinuity is seen in many regions around the world, both with P and Swaves. The D\" discontinuity has a mean apparent depth of about 250-265 km for both P and Swaves. While many more non-observations (where no discontinuity is observable above the seismic noise levels) exist for P waves than for S waves, both P and S nonobservations and observations are distributed with little obvious geographical coherence. The D\" discontinuity is often modeled as a precipitous increase in seismic velocity of about 2.5-3.0%, though most data can accommodate a transition width of up to 50 or 75 km.

            "Terrestrial planet formation is believed to have concluded in our Solar System with about 10 million to 100 million years of giant impacts, where hundreds of Moon-to Mars-sized planetary embryos acquired random velocities through gravitational encounters and resonances with one another and with Jupiter. This led to planet-crossing orbits and collisions that produced the four terrestrial planets, the Moon and asteroids. But here we show that colliding planets do not simply merge, as is commonly assumed. In many cases, the smaller planet escapes from the collision highly deformed, spun up, depressurized from equilibrium, stripped of its outer layers, and sometimes pulled apart into a chain of diverse objects. Remnants of these \u2018hit-and-run\u2019collisions are predicted to be common among remnant planet-forming populations, and thus to be relevant to asteroid formation and meteorite petrogenesis.",

            "We compare the atomic dynamics of the glass to that of the relevant crystal. In the spectra of inelastic scattering, the boson peak of the glass appears higher than the transverse acoustic (TA) singularity of the crystal. However, the density of states shows that they have the same number of states. Increasing pressure causes the transformation of the boson peak of the glass towards the TA singularity of the crystal. Once corrected for the difference in the elastic medium, the boson peak matches the TA singularity in energy and height. This suggests the identical nature of the two features.",

The frequency of the infrared\u2010active (A2u) mode of both hydroxides decreases with pressure, by \u22120.6 cm\u22121\/GPa for Mg(OH)2 over the pressure range studied, and by \u22123.5 cm\u22121\/GPa for Ca(OH)2 to 10.6 GPa. An additional mode observed in Mg(OH)2 is due to an optically induced hot band (A2u X A2u overtone): with increasing pressure, its intensity grows and its frequency decreases (\u22123.7 cm\u22121\/GPa). The negative pressure dependencies of these modes (negative Gr\u00fcneisen parameters) are explained in terms of compression increasing the hydrogen bond strength within the hydroxide structure.
