            "In this paper we discuss a novel material which has nearly ideal properties at optical frequencies. It combines the low dissipation of a dielectric with the reflectivity of a metal. This material employs a two\u2010dimensional photonic band gap structure to achieve in\u2010plane confinement of light and uses index contrast to achieve vertical confinement. We discuss how this material can be used to create microcavities for the production of low threshold lasers and waveguides capable of low\u2010loss bends.",

These are fabricated from GaAs\u2010AlGaAs quantum wells grown by molecular beam epitaxy and patterned by electron beam lithography. Contrary to our expectation, photoluminescence from these structures is extremely efficient. The excitation spectra of the two types of small structures differ greatly from each other and from that of the as\u2010grown quantum wells. These differences may be a result of the confinement of the carriers in these small structures.",

These efforts are driven in part by predictions of interesting linear and nonlinear optical properties for these structures. Experimental work has focused on various schemes to make uniform arrays of structures. New techniques developed for making these arrays have been followed by the observation of large zero-point energies and subband splittings for electrons, and modified exciton binding energies and selection rules for optical transitions in quantum wires.",

Powder X-ray diffraction measurements of polycrystalline material yielded lattice parameters in good agreement with predicted values. Photoluminescence efficiency at room temperature was observed to be independent of excitation intensity between 103 and 108 W\/cm2. The band gap was measured by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy to be 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 eV. The range of direct band gaps for the Zn(Si,Ge,Sn)N2 alloys is now predicted to extend from 4.5 to 1.7 eV, opening up this little-studied family of materials to a host of important applications.",

A model of the crescent\u2010shaped wires yields parabolic QWR potential wells with subbands separated by 21.7, 3.9, and 16.7 meV for electrons, heavy holes, and light holes and effective width of 16 nm for the ground electron state. Spectrally and spatially resolved cathodoluminescence images reveal highly uniform emission from the QWR regions. Photoluminescence excitation spectra exhibit enhanced absorption at the QWR subbands, with subband separations in good agreement with the model.",

The strain modulates the band gap to provide lateral quantum confinement for excitons. Here, we generate strain confinement in an InGaAs quantum well by reactive ion beam assisted etching through an overlying compressed pseudomorphic quaternary layer using etch masks patterned by electron beam lithography. Photoluminescence spectra of arrays of wires and dots show red\u2010shifted band gaps in direct evidence of lateral confinement. We compare our results to finite element calculations of the inhomogeneous strain in an InP substrate from a compressed overlayer patterned into rectangular wires.",
