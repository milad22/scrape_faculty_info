The papers have been chosen with the intention of emphasizing the topological aspects of the quantum Hall effect and its connections with other branches of theoretical physics, such as topological quantum field theories and string theory. The contents include sections on integer effect, fractional effect, effect of global topology, effective theories, edge states and non-Abelian statistics.",

When interacting with an electromagnetic field the resulting chiral boson theory has anomalies that are cancelled, via the Callan-Harvey mechanism, by contributions from the bulk. I also consider non-Abelian generalization of the bosonization that may be useful for chiral spin states.",
