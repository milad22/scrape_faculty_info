            "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",

Employing techniques similar to those we previously published, we observe a signal consistent with t t decay to WWb b, but inconsistent with the background prediction by 4.8 \u03c3. Additional evidence for the top quark is provided by a peak in the reconstructed mass distribution. We measure the top quark mass to be 176\u00b18 (stat)\u00b110 (syst) GeV\/c 2, and the t t production cross section to be 6.8\u2212 2.4+ 3.6 pb.",

            "A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at TeV, and up to 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, \u03c4\u03c4, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ\u2192 4\u2113, gives a mass estimate of 125. 3\u00b10. 4 (stat.)\u00b10. 5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons.

Photon candidates are identified by combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate.
