            "For 40 years, uniformly filled ellipsoidal beam distributions have been studied theoretically, as they hold the promise of generating self-fields linear in the coordinate offset in all three directions. Recently, a scheme for producing such distributions, based on the strong longitudinal expansion of an initially very short beam under its own space-charge forces, has been proposed. In this Letter we present the experimental demonstration of this scheme, obtained by illuminating the cathode in a rf photogun with an ultrashort laser pulse (\u223c 35 fs rms) with an appropriate transverse profile. The resulting 4 MeV beam spatiotemporal (x, t) distribution is imaged using a rf deflecting cavity with 50 fs resolution. A temporal asymmetry in the ellipsoidal profile, due to image charge effects at the photocathode, is observed at higher charge operation. This distortion is also found to degrade the transverse beam quality.",

We show that the electron bunches have a brightness one or two orders of magnitude larger than the current photoinjectors run in their design regime. The ultra-short bunches can be used to drive a high gain SASE X-ray FEL with a small gain length, to produce femtosecond to attosecond X-ray pulses. This method to produce such short X-ray pulses has the advantage over other proposed methods in that it can be free from longer pulse duration background radiation. We also show, using nascent SPARX SASE FEL as an example, that the electron bunch thus produced can be shorter than the cooperation length of the X-ray FEL, leading to the production of a single spike, fully coherent, X-ray pulse.

However, the present design of X-ray SASE FELs leads to an X-ray pulse about 100 times longer. The time structure of the X-ray pulse is determined by several factors, mainly the electron bunch length and the FEL cooperation length. Until now all FELs have been working in the regime where the electron bunch length is much larger than the cooperation length. In the case of an X-ray SASE FEL this means that the X-ray pulse consists of a series of spikes, a few hundred in the case of the LCLS, and the bunch length is of the order of 200 fs. Several methods to reduce the bunch length to the 10-1 fs region have been proposed. These methods are based on electron bunch manipulation to cut the lasing part of the bunch to a fraction of the total length, thus reducing the X-ray \u2026",

This tool is familiar from earlier schemes implemented for bunching dc electron sources, but presents peculiar challenges when applied to high current, low emittance beams from photoinjectors. The main difficulty foreseen is control of emittance oscillations in the beam in this scheme, which can be naturally considered as an extension of the emittance compensation process at moderate energies. This paper presents two scenarios in which velocity bunching, combined with emittance control, is to play a role in nascent projects. The first is termed ballistic bunching, where the changing of relative particle velocities and positions occur in distinct regions, a short high gradient linac, and a drift length. This scenario is discussed in the context of the proposed ORION photoinjector \u2026",
