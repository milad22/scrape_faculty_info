            "Recent progress in the correlation of contact angles with solid surface tensions are summarized. The measurements of meaningful contact angles in terms of surface energetics are also discussed. It is shown that the controversy with respect to measurement and interpretation of contact angles are due to the fact that some (or all) of the assumptions made in all energetic approaches are violated when contact angles are measured and processed. For a large number of polar and non-polar liquids on different solid surfaces, the liquid\u2013vapor surface tension times cosine of the contact angle, \u03b3lvcos\u03b8, is shown to depend only on the liquid\u2013vapor surface tension \u03b3lv, and the solid\u2013vapor surface tension \u03b3sv when the appropriate experimental techniques and procedures are used. Equations which follow these experimental patterns and which allow the determination of solid surface tensions from contact angles are \u2026",

The strategy employed is to construct an objective function which expresses the error between the physically observed and a theoretical Laplacian curve, i.e., a curve representing a solution of the Laplace equation of capillarity. This objective function is minimized numerically using the method of incremental loading in conjunction with the Newton\u2014Raphson method. This strategy is necessary as the otherwise powerful Newton-Raphson method depends on a good initial approximation to the true curve. Incremental loading provides a scheme of approaching the solution from a remote situation. A spherical meniscus, i.e., the case of infinite interfacial tension, is chosen here as the simple, unloaded solution. The method is \u2026",

The design of the experimental protocol was dictated by thermodynamic considerations. From the thermodynamic model for the adhesion of small particles from a suspension onto a solid substratum, it follows that the extent of adhesion is determined by the surface properties of all three phases involved, i.e., the surface tensions of the adhering particles, of the substrate, and of the suspending liquid medium. In essence, adhesion is more extensive to hydrophilic substrata (i.e., substrata of relatively high surface tension) than to hydrophobic substrata, when the surface tension of the bacteria is larger than that of the suspending medium.

The equation of state is obtained using two independent methods. In the first one, similar arguments to those in previous papers are used; however, the qualitative argument, based on the general appearance of plots, is replaced by computer curve fitting and statistical analysis. The second method, which has not been employed heretofore, treats the solid surface tension as an adjustable parameter. Molecular arguments in conjunction with the interaction parameter \u03a6 are used to eliminate poor choices of the solid surface tension. The results are in excellent agreement with the first method.The range of validity of the equation of state and practical points in its application are \u2026",

An automatic digitization technique utilizing recent developments in digital image acquisition and analysis to achieve rapid and accurate data acquisition and preprocessing is presented. The technique eliminates errors due to the optical distortions. It was found that high accuracy could be obtained through the use of sub-pixel resolution in determining the drop profile coordinates.

            "A theoretical treatment of the effect of surface heterogeneity on contact angles is given, by means of a model employing the capillary rise of a liquid in contact with a stripwise heterogeneous surface. Local contortions of the liquid-vapor surface are postulated to conform to an assumed periodic shape of the three-phase line. A minimum of free energy is found in a configuration in which Young's equation is obeyed locally. When the width of the strips is below some value of the order of 0.1 \u03bc, the amplitude of the periodic contortion of the three-phase line is less than about 10 A, which is operationally indistinguishable from a straight line. Extension of this model is made to a patchwise heterogeneous surface, and a mechanism for hysteresis is developed. For patches smaller than about 0.1 \u03bc, it is shown that heterogeneity should make a negligible contribution to hysteresis.",

            "The previous chapter was largely theoretical, in that it dealt with the interpretation of contact angle results in terms of solid surface energies. It also delved into the question of how the structure of a solid surface affects the contact angle that a liquid forms on the solid. The level of structure considered there included features that are not macroscopically observed, such as microheterogeneities, or minute peaks, pits, hills, and grooves in various geometries. Their existence may be inferred from certain observations, such as contact angle hysteresis, and sometimes they can be observed directly, e.g., with the optical or electron microscope.",
