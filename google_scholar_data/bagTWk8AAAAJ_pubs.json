The total quark (and hence the quark orbital) contribution is shown to be measurable through virtual Compton scattering in a special kinematic region where single quark scattering dominates. This deeply virtual Compton scattering has much potential to unravel the quark and gluon structure of the nucleon.",

We show that DVCS can probe a new type of off-forward parton distributions. We derive an Altarelli-Parisi-type of evolution equations for these distributions. We also derive their sum rules in terms of nucleon form factors of the twist-two quark and gluon operators. In particular, we find that the second sum rule is related to fractions of the nucleon spin carried separately by quarks and gluons. We estimate the cross section for DVCS and compare it with the accompanying Bethe-Heitler process at CEBAF and HERMES kinematics.",

The excellent energy resolution and the large fiducial volume anticipated for the JUNO detector offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important topics in neutrino and astro-particle physics. In this document, we present the physics motivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various proposed measurements. Following an introduction summarizing the current status and open issues in neutrino physics, we discuss how the detection of antineutrinos generated by a cluster of nuclear power plants allows the determination of the neutrino MH at a 3\u20134\u03c3 significance with six years of running of JUNO.

We show that these interactions give rise to gauge invariance of the transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions. As compared to previous analyses, our study demonstrates the existence of extra scaling contributions from transverse components of the gauge potential at the light-cone infinity. They form a transverse gauge link which is indispensable for restoration of the gauge invariance of parton distributions in the light-cone gauge where the gauge potential does not vanish asymptotically. Our finding helps to explain a number of features observed in a model calculation of structure functions in the light-cone gauge.",

No dark matter candidate is identified above background. In combination with the data set during the commissioning run, with a total exposure of 3.3\u00d7 10 4 kg day, the most stringent limit to the spin-independent interaction between the ordinary and WIMP dark matter is set for a range of dark matter mass between 5 and 1000 GeV\/c 2. The best upper limit on the scattering cross section is found 2.5\u00d7 10\u2212 46 cm 2 for the WIMP mass 40 GeV\/c 2 at 90% confidence level.",
