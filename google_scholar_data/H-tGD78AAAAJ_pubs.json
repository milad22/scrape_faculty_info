Noting that the geometry of the conventional gauge theories can be described in terms of a fiber bundle, and that their action is a scalar in such a superspace, we construct principal fiber bundles based on the above gauge groups and propose to describe gravitation in terms of their corresponding scalar curvatures. To ensure that these manifolds do indeed have close ties with the space-time of general relativity, we make use of the notion of the parallel transport of vector fields in space-time to uniquely relate the connections in space-time to the gauge potentials in fiber bundles. The relations turn out to be similar to that suggested earlier by Yang. The actions we obtain are related to those of Einstein and Yang but are \u2026",

            "Making use of the similarity between the factorized spectrum of the generalized beta function and the spectrum of a vibrating string in Minkowski space, we construct a formalism within which we give a geometrical interpretation to the gauge symmetries inherent in the theory. The key point in the construction is the identification of the harmonic-oscillator amplitude with the components of actual coordinates in space-time. It turns out that these coordinates must satisfy certain constraints arising from purely geometrical considerations, and these constraint equations are then shown to be the familiar gauge conditions on the underlying states. Analogies with more familiar gauge theories are pointed out.",

We sought to quantify the consequences of Ebola virus disease on maternal and child health services in the highly-affected Forest region of Guinea.We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of women and children attending public health facilities for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and immunisation services in six of seven health districts in the Forest region (Beyla, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Kissidougou, Lola, Macenta, and N'Z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9). We examined monthly service use data for eight maternal and child health services indicators: antenatal care (\u22651 antenatal care visit and \u22653 antenatal care visits), institutional delivery, and receipt of five infant vaccines: polio, pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B virus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b), yellow fever \u2026",
