            "Sorghum, an African grass related to sugar cane and maize, is grown for food, feed, fibre and fuel. We present an initial analysis of the\u223c 730-megabase Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench genome, placing\u223c 98% of genes in their chromosomal context using whole-genome shotgun sequence validated by genetic, physical and syntenic information. Genetic recombination is largely confined to about one-third of the sorghum genome with gene order and density similar to those of rice. Retrotransposon accumulation in recombinationally recalcitrant heterochromatin explains the\u223c 75% larger genome size of sorghum compared with rice. Although gene and repetitive DNA distributions have been preserved since palaeopolyploidization\u223c 70 million years ago, most duplicated gene sets lost one member before the sorghum\u2013rice divergence. Concerted evolution makes one duplicated chromosomal segment appear to be only \u2026",
