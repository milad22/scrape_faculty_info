Strangeness enhancement is observed as an increase in the slope of the kaon yield with the total number of participants as well as the yield per participant. The enhancement starts with peripheral Si+ Al and Si+ Au collisions (relative to N+ N) and appears to saturate for a moderate number of participating nucleons in Si+ Au collisions. It is also observed to increase slowly with centrality in Au+ Au collisions, to a level in the most central Au+ Au collisions that is greater than that found in central Si+ A collisions.

            "Nowadays, many countries adopt an active agenda to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions by moving towards less polluting energy generation technologies. The environmental costs, directly or indirectly generated to achieve such a challenging objective, remain however largely underexplored. Until now, research has focused either on pure economic approaches such as Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and partial equilibrium (PE) models, or on (physical) energy supply scenarios. These latter could be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of various energy saving or cleaner technologies via Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. These modelling efforts have, however, been pursued in isolation, without exploring the possible complementarities and synergies. In this study, we have undertaken a practical combination of these approaches into a common framework: on the one hand \u2026",

We observe little significant centrality dependence in neither K\u2212\/K+ nor bar p\/p ratios and they are almost constant as a function of P T. In addition to the chemical freeze-out temperature T ch, we extract the chemical potentials for both light and strange quarks (\u03bc q and \u03bc s) by comparing the present data with simple model predictions. T ch is greater than the thermal freeze-out temperature which is extracted from the transverse momentum distribution of charged hadrons.",

A considerable enhancement of K+ production per \u03c0 is observed, as compared to p+p collisions at this energy. To illustrate the importance of secondary hadron rescattering as an enhancement mechanism, we compare strangeness production at the SPS and AGS with predictions of the transport model RQMD.",
