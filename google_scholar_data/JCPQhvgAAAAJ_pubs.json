These are (1) a non-Galilean invariance caused by a density-dependent coefficient in the convection term, and (2) a velocity-dependent equation of state. In this paper, we show that both of these effects can be eliminated exactly in a lattice Boltzmann-equation model.",

These quantities are the three rugged invariants of three\u2010dimensional ideal incompressible MHD turbulence theory. The theoretical technique for measuring the magnetic helicity from the matrix of two\u2010point correlations is shown. The length scales characterizing the magnetic helicity are found to be equal to or greater than those which characterize the magnetic energy. The magnetic helicity typically lies at scales larger than the magnetic correlation length, consistent with the expectations of the inverse cascade and selective decay hypotheses of three\u2010dimensional MHD turbulence. At smaller scales, the magnetic helicity oscillates in sign. Our measurements of the cross helicity are not fully consistent with the usual interpretation in terms of outward propagating Alfv\u00e9nic functuations. Especially \u2026",

The algorithm provides advantages similar to the cellular automaton method in that it is local and easily adapted to parallel computing environments. Because of much lower noise levels and less stringent requirements on lattice size, the method appears to be more competitive with traditional solution methods. Examples show that the model accurately reproduces both linear and nonlinear MHD phenomena.",

It is reasonable to assume that the dissipation range represents the final fate of magnetic energy that is transferred from the largest spatial scales via nonlinear processes until kinetic coupling with the background plasma removes the energy from the spectrum and heats the background distribution. Typically, the dissipation range at 1 AU sets in at spacecraft frame frequencies of a few tenths of a hertz. It is characterized by a steepening of the power spectrum and often demonstrates a bias of the polarization or magnetic helicity spectrum.
