            "Behavioral momentum refers to the tendency for behavior to persist following a change in environmental conditions. The greater the rate of reinforcement, the greater the behavioral momentum. The intervention for noncompliance consisted of issuing a sequence of commands with which the subject was very likely to comply (i.e., high\u2010probability commands) immediately prior to issuing a low\u2010probability command. In each of five experiments, the high\u2010probability command sequence resulted in a \u201cmomentum\u201d of compliant responding that persisted when a low\u2010probability request was issued. Results showed the antecedent high\u2010probability command sequence increased compliance and decreased compliance latency and task duration. \u201cMomentum\u2010like\u201d effects were shown to be distinct from experimenter attention and to depend on the contiguity between the high\u2010probability command sequence and the low \u2026",

            "Descriptive and experimental methods were used to analyze the environmental determinants of an adult's bizarre speech. A descriptive analysis of behavior under natural conditions indicated that bizarre vocalizations occurred most often in the presence of task\u2010related demands and in the absence of adult attention. Further, bizarre speech occurring during tasks was followed frequently by the cessation of task demands by staff or the subject's voluntary disengagement from task\u2010related activities; bizarre speech observed during noninteractional periods (i.e., in the absence of adult attention) was frequently followed by staff attention. The escape and attention hypotheses were tested under analogue conditions. Results of the experimental analysis supported only the attention hypothesis; that is, bizarre speech appeared to function as an attention\u2010producing behavior.

            "Any account of self-regulation or self-control according to a particular theoretical perspective must begin with a discussion of what its proponents mean when they speak of self-regulation. Most theories of self-control advance a view of human behavior that is to one degree or another self-determined. It is a view much like the relationship between a pilot and his airplane, where the pilot is the \u201cself\u201d who performs some operation from \u201cwithin\u201d to direct or control the plane\u2019s course or behavior. Beginning with this assumption obligates these theorists to describe, speculate, or otherwise account for the operations performed by the self, be they cognitions or exercises of free will, of which self-regulated behavior is believed to be a function.",

Previous research has succeeded in identifying a wide variety of environmental events which may contribute to an individual's maladaptive responding. These general classes of variables are summarized and presented with relevant examples. We conclude with suggestions for conducting a comprehensive functional analysis using descriptive and experimental methods leading to the development and evaluation of analysis- derived interventions.",

The students completed math problems from two alternative sets on concurrent variable\u2010interval (VI) 30\u2010s VI 120\u2010s schedules of reinforcement. During the equal\u2010quality reinforcer condition, high\u2010quality (nickels) and low\u2010quality items (\u201cprogram money\u201d in the school's token economy) were alternated across sessions as the reinforcer for both sets of problems. During the unequal\u2010quality reinforcer condition, the low\u2010quality reinforcer was used for the set of problems on the VI 30\u2010s schedule, and the high\u2010quality reinforcer was used for the set of problems on the VI 120\u2010s schedule. Equal\u2010 and unequal\u2010quality reinforcer conditions were alternated using a reversal design. Results showed that sensitivity to the features of \u2026",

Neither demands the intellectual support of a broad scholarly community or the material support of society. Translational research can do better by seeking innovation in theory or practice through the synthesis of basic and applied questions, literatures, and methods. Although translational thinking has always occurred in behavior analysis, progress often has been constrained by a functional separation of basic and applied communities. A review of translational traditions in behavior analysis suggests that innovation is most likely when individuals with basic and applied expertise collaborate. Such innovation may have to accelerate for behavior analysis to be taken seriously as a general\u2010purpose \u2026",
