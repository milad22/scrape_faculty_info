            "Calabi-Yau spaces are complex spaces with a vanishing first Chern class, or equivalently, with trivial canonical bundle (canonical class). They are used to construct possibly realistic (super) string models and are thus being studied vigorously in the recent physics literature. In the main part of the Book, collected and reviewed are relevant results on (1) several major techniques of constructing such spaces and (2) computation of physically relevant quantities such as massless field spectra and their Yukawa interactions. Issues of (3) stringy corrections and (4) moduli space and its geometry are still in the stage of rapid and continuing development, whence there is more emphasis on open problems here. Also is included a preliminary discussion of the conjectured universal moduli space and related open problems. Finally, several detailed models and sample computations are included throughout the Book to exemplify the techniques and the general discussion. The Book also contains a Lexicon (28 pages) of 150 assorted terms, key-words and main results and theorems, well suited for a handy reference. Although cross-referenced with the main part of the Book, the Lexicon can also be used independently. The level of mathematics is guided and developed between that of the popular Physics Reports of Eguchi, Gilkey and Hanson and the book Superstrings (Vol. 2) by Green, Schwarz and Witten on one end and Principles of Algebraic Geometry of Griffiths and Harris on the other. This is the first systematic exposition in book form of the material on Calabi-Yau spaces, related mathematics and the physics application, otherwise scattered through \u2026",

            "The possible ways of compacitification of theE 8 \u2297E 8 Superstring theory to four dimensions are reviewed. The phenomenological need forN=1 supersymmetry is argued (on quite general grounds) to favour the choice of a Calabi-Yau manifold for the compact internal manifold. The massless spectrum after compactification is derived in full detail revealing, beside the usual particles, others that may have great phenomenological impact. The technical aspects of the construction of such manifolds are examined and the methods of calculation of the relevant topological properties are given. A big family of such constructions, giving rise to many new Calabi-Yau manifolds, is presented and its relevance to the search of a phenomenologically acceptable solution is discussed.",

This framework provides a method of generating all Adinkras with the same topology, and so also all the corresponding irreducible supersymmetric multiplets. We develop some graph theoretic techniques to understand these diagrams in terms of a relatively small amount of information, namely, at what heights various vertices of the graph should be \"hung.\"We then show how Adinkras that are the graphs of N-dimensional cubes can be obtained for superfields satisfying constraints that involve superderivatives. This dramatically widens the range of supermultiplets that can be described using the superspace formalism and also organizes them. Other topologies for \u2026",
