            "The realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional van der Waals crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, could lead to new magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications 1, 2, 3, 4. In two-dimensional systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly suppressed by thermal fluctuations, according to the Mermin\u2013Wagner theorem 5; however, these thermal fluctuations can be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy. Previous efforts, based on defect and composition engineering 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or the proximity effect, introduced magnetic responses only locally or extrinsically. Here we report intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 atomic layers, as revealed by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In this magnetically soft, two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, we achieve unprecedented control of the transition temperature \u2026",

We observed nonzero Kerr rotations as big as 65 nanorad appearing below T c in large domains.

We observed nonzero Kerr rotations of order\u223c 1 \u03bc rad appearing near the pseudogap temperature T* and marking what appears to be a true phase transition.
