            "A household\u2019s observed poverty status is an ex-post measure of a household\u2019s well-being (or lack thereof). But for thinking about forward-looking anti-poverty interventions that aim to prevent rather than alleviate poverty, what really matters is the vulnerability of households to poverty, ie, the exante risk that a household will, if currently non-poor, fall below the poverty line, or if currently poor, will remain in poverty. Ideally, vulnerability at the household level would be estimated with panel data of sufficient length and richness. However, such data are rare, especially in poor, developing economies. We argue in this paper that despite the limitations of purely cross-sectional data, an analysis of these data can potentially be informative. We lay out a simple and fairly flexible methodology for empirically assessing household vulnerability to poverty using cross-sectional survey data, and demonstrate the uses and limitations of the proposed methods through a case study using data from the December 1998 mini-SUSENAS survey from Indonesia.",

            "How important are neighbourhood endowments of physical and human capital in explaining diverging fortunes over time for otherwise identical households in a developing rural economy? To answer this question we develop an estimable micro model of consumption growth allowing for constraints on factor mobility and externalities, whereby geographic capital can influence the productivity of a household's own capital. Our statistical test has considerable power in detecting geographic effects given that we control for latent heterogeneity in measured consumption growth rates at the micro level. We find robust evidence of geographic poverty traps in farm\u2010household panel data from post\u2010reform rural China. Our results strengthen the equity and efficiency case for public investment in lagging poor areas in this setting. Copyright \u00a9 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The risk insurance models are estimated by Generalized Method of Moments treating income and household size as endogenous. Partial insurance is indicated for all wealth groups, although the hypothesis of perfect insurance is universally rejected. The rejection of full insurance is strongest for the poorest wealth decile, with 40% of an income shock being passed onto current consumption. By contrast, consumption by the richest third of households is protected from almost 90% of an income shock. The extent of insurance in a given wealth stratum varies little between poor and non-poor areas.",

Using robust semi\u2010parametric methods and household panel data for rural China, we test whether transient poverty is determined by a process that is similar to chronic poverty.

Half of the mean squared poverty gap and over a third of the mean poverty gap is transient, in that it is directly attributable to year-to-year fluctuations in consumption. There is enough transient poverty to treble the cost of eliminating chronic poverty when targeting transfers according to current consumptions and to tilt the balance in favor of untargeted transfers.

The characteristics of the annihilation gamma rays depend strongly on the local environment of the annihilation sites and are used to probe defect concentrations in a range inaccessible to conventional defect probes, yet which are important in the electrical performance of device structures.

            "Heavy metal (HMs) contamination is widespread globally due to anthropogenic, technogenic, and geogenic activities. The HMs exposure could lead to multiple toxic effects in plants by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which inhibit most cellular processes at various levels of metabolism. ROS being highly unstable could play dual role (1) damaging cellular components and (2) act as an important secondary messenger for inducing plant defense system. Cells are equipped with enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms to counteract this damage. Some are constitutive and others that are activated only when a stress-specific signal is perceived. Enzymatic scavengers of ROS include superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and peroxidase, while non-enzymatic antioxidants are glutathione, ascorbic acid, \u03b1-tocopherol, flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and organic acids \u2026",

            "We study portfolio and other behavioral responses to idiosyncratic risk in household panel data for rural China. One quarter of wealth is held in unproductive liquid forms. However, only a small share of this appears to be a precaution against income risk. We estimate that eliminating income risk would reduce the share of wealth held in liquid form by less than one percentage point. Furthermore, this effect is largely confined to middle income groups; high-income households do not, it seems, need to hold unproductive precautionary wealth, and the poor probably cannot afford to do so. We find no evidence that income risk discourages schooling, but it does appear to inhibit the temporary out migration of labor.",
