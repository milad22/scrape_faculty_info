            "NO2 gas sensor was fabricated by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique and rapid photothermal processing (RPP) of the Sn-doped ZnO film. The experimental results shows that tin doping of zinc oxide thin films improve the sensor element sensitivity to 1.5 ppm NO2 in air and downshift the operating temperature. The influence of variation of Sn concentration in the chemical bath and the RPP temperature on NO2 sensitivity of thin film sensor elements was investigated in this work. Higher sensitivity was obtained at 5\u201310 at.% tin concentration in the solution of ions and RPP temperature of 550\u2013650 \u00b0C. Increasing the Sn concentration in doped ZnO samples more than 10 at.% as well as decreasing the oxygen partial pressure leads to the NO2 gas sensitivity decrease. It looks promising to use the inexpensive tin-doped zinc oxide thin films obtained by SILAR method and RPP in smart gas \u2026",

We studied the diameter dependence of the gas response and selectivity of ZnO nanowires (NWs) synthesized by chemical vapor phase growth method. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were used to determine the deep levels related to defects which are presented in the ZnO nanomaterial as well as to evaluate the effect of thermal treatment in H2 atmosphere on the emission from ZnO nanowires. We show that sample annealed in hydrogen leads to passivation of recombination centers thus modifying the NWs properties.We studied the gas response and selectivity of these ZnO nanowires to H2, NH3, i-Butane, CH4 gases at room temperature.

We demonstrate that the properties, especially UV emission, observed at room temperature, of electrodeposited ZnO thin films from chloride medium (at 70 \u00b0C) on fluor-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates is strongly influenced by the post-growth thermal annealing treatments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show that the films have preferably grown along (0 0 2) direction. Thermal annealing in the temperature range of 150\u2013400 \u00b0C in air has been carried out for these ZnO thin films. The as-grown films contain chlorine which is partially removed after annealing at 400 \u00b0C. Morphological changes upon annealing are discussed in the light of compositional \u2026",

All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the morphology and ordering of ZnO nanorods are determined by the growth temperature, the overall concentration of the precursors and deposition time.ZnO nanorod morphology and surface-to-volume ratio are most sensitive to temperature. The width of ZnO nanorods can be controlled by the overall concentration of the reactants and by temperature.
