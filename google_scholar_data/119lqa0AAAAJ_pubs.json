It has formed the basis of many sociological \u2018classics\u2019 focused on the workplace and the experiences of workers, and has also been mobilized to chart wider social malaise and individual troubles. Alienation theory usage has, however, declined significantly since its heyday of the 1960s and 1970s. Here, the reasons why alienation theory was \u2018forgotten\u2019 and what can be gained by \u2018remembering\u2019 alienation theory are explored. To realize this ambition this article proceeds by (1) briefly visiting differing definitions of alienation theory, before charting its high point, and the various debates and tensions of the time, during the 1960s and 1970s; (2) analysing the reasons why alienation theory fell from grace from the 1980s onwards; (3) elaborating how and why alienation theory is still relevant for sociology and the \u2026",

            "Even though alienation theory is one of Marx's better known theories, its potential for medical sociology has never been fully explored. This paper seeks to raise the profile of Marx's theory of alienation in theorizing health and health inequalities. It will do so in three main stages. Firstly, why it is timely to reconsider alienation theory will be discussed in light of recent theoretical debates and wider concerns in medical sociology about embodiment and emotions. Secondly, alienation theory is outlined beginning with the strong materialist, biological, embodied and emotional basis of Marx's ideas before exploring how alienation arises under capitalism. This section will also deal with how Marx's theory of alienation is important to his entire oeuvre and not just present in his early work. Thirdly, the paper ends by reviewing examples of health research in the light of the four aspects of alienation that Marx identifies \u2026",

How does collaborative social work practice impact on the experience of service-users and carers? These questions are faced by social workers every day and interprofessional collaborative practice is high on the policy agenda for trainees and practitioners. Written primarily for social work students and practitioners, although having relevance across the wider range of stakeholders, this book explores the issues, benefits and challenges that interprofessional collaborative practice can raise. Chapter-by-chapter the book will encourage the reader to critically examine the political, legal, social and economic context of interprofessional practice. It also explores how social workers can work effectively and collaboratively with other professions while retaining their own values and identity. Key features include:-activities to illustrate the ways in which collaborative working can impact upon the experiences of service users, carers and practitioners;-discussions looking at the different people and organisations with whom social workers might work in practice;-examples of research and knowledge for practice;-a glossary to act as a useful quick reference point for the reader;-a companion website. Engaging and well-written, each chapter also includes case studies, reflective questions and links to further reading and sources of information.
