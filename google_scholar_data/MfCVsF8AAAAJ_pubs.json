            "In this paper, we propose a new hybrid ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for feature selection (FS), called ACOFS, using a neural network. A key aspect of this algorithm is the selection of a subset of salient features of reduced size. ACOFS uses a hybrid search technique that combines the advantages of wrapper and filter approaches. In order to facilitate such a hybrid search, we designed new sets of rules for pheromone update and heuristic information measurement. On the other hand, the ants are guided in correct directions while constructing graph (subset) paths using a bounded scheme in each and every step in the algorithm. The above combinations ultimately not only provide an effective balance between exploration and exploitation of ants in the search, but also intensify the global search capability of ACO for a high-quality solution in FS. We evaluate the performance of ACOFS on eight benchmark \u2026",

            "This paper presents a new hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) for feature selection (FS), called as HGAFS. The vital aspect of this algorithm is the selection of salient feature subset within a reduced size. HGAFS incorporates a new local search operation that is devised and embedded in HGA to fine-tune the search in FS process. The local search technique works on basis of the distinct and informative nature of input features that is computed by their correlation information. The aim is to guide the search process so that the newly generated offsprings can be adjusted by the less correlated (distinct) features consisting of general and special characteristics of a given dataset. Thus, the proposed HGAFS receives the reduced redundancy of information among the selected features. On the other hand, HGAFS emphasizes on selecting a subset of salient features with reduced number using a subset size determination \u2026",

            "5-HMF is widely presented in foods and produced through the degradation of hexoses and Maillard reaction during heat treatment of foods containing reducing sugars and amino acids in an acid environment. However, controversial conclusions on the biological effects of 5-HMF have been drawn in previous studies. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of 5-HMF. The 2,2\u2032-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and the hemolysis assay induced by 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) were performed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of 5-HMF. The results showed that 5-HMF exhibited novel antioxidant activity by scavenging the ABTS and DPPH free radicals and inhibited the AAPH-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner.

Bioinformatic analyses have shown that there is a single gene for each kisspeptin (Kiss2) and its receptor (Kiss1r) in pufferfish, the function of which has yet to be elucidated. We cloned these two genes in grass puffer, which spawns on beach with semilunar cycles, and examined changes in their expression levels in the brain and pituitary at different reproductive stages over the spawning season.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for each of the honey tested using standard assay procedures. In terms of physicochemical properties, it was observed that the pH of these honeys was within 3.55-4.91, their specific gravity was 1.3-1.35, moisture content was 16-23.3% and dry matter content was 76.6-84%.

The objective of using negative correlation learning (NCL) is to expertise the individuals on different parts or portion of input patterns in an ensemble. The available currencies in the market consist of new, old and noisy ones. It is often difficult for machine to recognize these currencies; therefore we propose a system that uses ENN to identify them efficiently. We performed our experiment for seven different types of TAKA (Bangladeshi currency) which are 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 TAKA. The image of different types note is converted in gray scale and compressed in the desired range. Each pixel of the compressed image is given as an input to the network. This system is able to recognize highly noisy or old image of TAKA. Ensemble network is very useful for the classification of different types of currencies. It reduces the chances of misclassification than a single network and ensemble network with independent training. In experimental results we have shown this with artificially added noise in the test set. We also find good result for similar pattern available in market.",
