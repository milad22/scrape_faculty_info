            "Oestrogens are involved in the growth, development and homeostasis of a number of tissues 1. The physiological effects of these steroids are mediated by a ligand-inducible nuclear transcription factor, the oestrogen receptor (ER) 2. Hormone binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ER initiates a series of molecular events culminating in the activation or repression of target genes. Transcriptional regulation arises from the direct interaction of the ER with components of the cellular transcription machinery 3, 4. Here we report the crystal structures of the LBD of ER in complex with the endogenous oestrogen, 17\u03b2-oestradiol, and the selective antagonist raloxifene 5, at resolutions of 3.1 and 2.6 \u00c5, respectively. The structures provide a molecular basis for the distinctive pharmacophore of the ER and its catholic binding properties. Agonist and antagonist bind at the same site within the core of the LBD but \u2026",

Receptor agonists promote coactivator binding, and antagonists block coactivator binding. Here we report the crystal structure of the human estrogen receptor \u03b1 (hER\u03b1) ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to both the agonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) and a peptide derived from the NR box II region of the coactivator GRIP1 and the crystal structure of the hER\u03b1 LBD bound to the selective antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). In the DES-LBD-peptide complex, the peptide binds as a short \u03b1 helix to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the LBD. In the OHT-LBD complex, helix 12 occludes the coactivator recognition groove by mimicking the interactions of the NR box peptide with the LBD.

            "Although it is widely accepted that specific intracellular receptor proteins are involved in the oestrogenic regulation of gene expression and growth in reproductive tissues, the precise nature of the regulation is poorly understood. Among the unresolved issues are the distribution and dynamics of the oestrogen receptor protein (oestrophilin) in target tissues in the presence and absence of oestrogens and antioestrogens. The use of radio-labelled and unlabelled receptor ligands to detect and measure oestrogen receptors in tissues has been complicated by the presence of other intracellular steroid-binding proteins 1 and by the low concentration of receptors in responsive tissues. We report here the development of an immunocytochemical procedure that is suitable for localizing oestrophilin directly in frozen tissue sections or cells from human and several non-human sources.

Clones corresponding to ER sequence were isolated from both libraries after screening with either ER monoclonal antibodies (lambda gt11) or synthetic oligonucleotide probes designed from two peptide sequences of purified ER (lambda gt10). Five cDNA clones were isolated by antibody screening and five were isolated after screening with synthetic oligonucleotides. The two largest ER cDNA clones, lambda OR3 (1.3 kilobase pairs) and lambda OR8 (2.1 kilobase pairs), isolated by using antibodies and oligonucleotides, respectively, were able to enrich selectively for ER mRNA by hybrid-selection. Furthermore, lambda OR8 contains the \u2026",
