            "The research detailed in this monograph was originally motivated by our interest in control problems involving partial and delay differential equations. Our attempts to apply control theory techniques to such prob lems in several areas of science convinced us that in the need for better and more detailed models of distributed\/continuum processes in biology and mechanics lay a rich, interesting, and challenging class of fundamen tal questions. These questions, which involve science and mathematics, are typical of those arising in inverse or parameter estimation problems. Our efforts on inverse problems for distributed parameter systems, which are infinite dimensional in the most common realizations, began about seven years ago at a time when rapid advances in computing capabilities and availability held promise for significant progress in the development of a practically useful as well as theoretically sound methodology for such problems. Much of the research reported in our presentation was not begun when we outlined the plans for this monograph some years ago. By publishing this monograph now, when only a part of the originally intended topics are covered (see Chapter VII in this respect), we hope to stimulate the research and interest of others in an area of scientific en deavor which has exceeded even our optimistic expectations with respect to excitement, opportunity, and stimulation. The computer revolution alluded to above and the development of new codes allow one to solve rather routinely certain estimation problems that would have been out of the question ten years ago.",

Four separate damping mechanisms consisting of air damping, strain rate damping, spatial hysteresis, and time hysteresis are considered experimentally. Dynamic tests were performed to produce time histories. The time history data is then used along with an approximate model to form a sequence of least squares problems. The solution of the least squares problem yields the estimated damping coefficients. The resulting experimentally determined analytical model is compared with the time histories via numerical simulation of the dynamic response. The procedure suggested here is compared with a standard modal damping ratio model commonly used in experimental modal analysis.",

            "A method for the non-destructive detection and location of damage using parameterized partial differential equations and Galerkin approximation techniques is presented. Damages in a structure cause changes in the physical coefficients?!of mass density, elastic modulus and damping coefficients. This paper examines the use of beam like structure with piezoceramic sensors and actuators to perform identification of those physical parameters, and hence to detect the damage. The method casts the inverse problem as an optimization problem. The iterative method is based on enhanced least-square error minimization. Experimental results are presented from tests on cantilevered aluminum beams damaged at different locations and with damage of different dimensions. It is demonstrated that the method can sense the presence of damage, and locate and characterize the damage to a satisfactory precision.",
