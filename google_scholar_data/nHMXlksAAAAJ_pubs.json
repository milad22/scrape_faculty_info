These compounds exhibit N-type semiconducting behavior with relatively high Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivity, and room temperature carrier concentrations in the range of 1017\u20131018\u2002cm\u22123. The thermal conductivity is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that of crystalline germanium and has a glasslike temperature dependence. The resulting thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, at room temperature for the present samples is 14 that of Bi2Te3 alloys currently used in devices for thermoelectric cooling. Extrapolating our measurements to above room temperature, we estimate that ZT>1 at T>700\u2002K, thus exceeding that of most known materials.",

            "Polycrystalline samples of antimonides with the skutterudite crystal structure with La partially filling the voids have been prepared in an effort to quantify the impact of partial void filling on the lattice thermal conductivity of these compounds. It is observed that a relatively small concentration of La in the voids results in a relatively large decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, the largest decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity, compared to \u201cunfilled\u201d CoSb 3 is not observed near 100% filling of the voids with La, as was previously believed. This suggests a point-defect-type phonon scattering effect due to the partial, random distribution of La in the voids as well as the \u201crattling\u201d effect of the La ions, resulting in the scattering of a larger spectrum of phonons than in the case of 100% filling. An additional benefit of partial filling in thermoelectric materials is that it may be one way of adjusting the electronic \u2026",

Much sharper features in the T dependence of S are observed than have been previously reported. Both the temperature and oxygen-doping dependences of S, which have caused confusion, are consistently accounted for by conventional metallic theory for the first time. Strong phonon drag and two carrier species are indicated, with holes on the planes and electrons on the chains. An anomalous, positive component to S, observed for T< 160 K, is attributed to a freeze-out of carrier-phonon umklapp processes involving holes in the CuO 2 planes and optical-mode phonons.",

            "The synthesis and structural, chemical, and transport properties of a new clathrate compound with elemental composition Cs8Zn4Sn42 is reported. This compound is cubic with space group Pm3\u0304n and a lattice parameter of 12.1226(19) \u00c5. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and structural refinement indicate that Cs atoms reside in the polyhedral cavities formed by the tetrahedrally bonded network of Zn and Sn atoms. The Cs atom in the larger polyhedra (tetrakaidecahedra) exhibit greater and more anisotropic thermal motion than those of the smaller polyhedra (dodecahedra). This \u201crattling\u201d of the Cs contributes to the low thermal conductivity of this compound, obtained on a polycrystalline pellet. In addition, Zn is ordered in this compound. Electronic properties and the potential of this type of Sn-clathrate for thermoelectric applications are also discussed. ",
