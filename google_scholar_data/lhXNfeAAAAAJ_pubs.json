Due to this effective long-range interaction, effective-range theory in its normal form is not applicable. Thus, for the scattering of a particle with an incident orbital angular momentum of zero, for example, the expansion of k cot \u03b7 (0) includes terms in k and in k 2 ln k, in addition to the usual constant and k 2 terms. The effective range r 0 as normally defined is infinite, but one can define a quantity r p 0 which explicitly takes into account the long-range character of the effective potential. For L> 0 it is k 2 cot \u03b7 (L) which approaches a constant as k approaches zero rather than k 2 L+ 1 cot \u03b7 (L) as for a short-range potential.

In addition, an effective-potential theory, which also allows for variational formulation, is derived for the three-body system with long-ranged Coulomb interactions properly accounted for. These results generalize previous work done for systems with short-ranged interactions; the difference lies, essentially, in the use of Coulomb-modified plane waves to describe the asymptotic states.

The extension of this result to the case where one or more composite bound states do exist is presented here. The inclusion of tensor forces, exchange forces, and Coulomb forces is allowed. Several methods are given for obtaining a rigorous upper bound on the scattering length, which involve the addition of certain positive terms to the Kohn-Hulth\u00e9n variational expression. The approximate information about the composite bound states which is required to construct these additional terms can be found by standard methods. As a \u2026",

            "Interest in the theory of electron-atom scattering in a radiation field has increased in recent years as a result of the important role it plays in the study of plasma heating, gas breakdown, and laser-driven fusion. The theory has been a subject of study, particularly in connection with the bremsstrahlung process. Owing to the dominance of stimulated emission and absorption, the theory of scattering in a laser field takes on a form somewhat different from the more familiar theory of spontaneous bremsstrahlung. However, the underlying physics is the same in the two cases, and it is interesting to trace the connections. The chapter emphasizes on the recent developments in the theory of multiphoton processes in electron\u2013atom scattering. It particularly describes the connections that exist between the time-dependent and time-independent versions of the theory, the relationship between the classical and \u2026",

The equations obtained are similar in structure to the N-body formulation of Weinberg and have the same desirable feature, namely, that \u03b4-function singularities in the kernel due to disconnected processes have been removed, so that Fredholm theory may be expected to apply. A possible advantage of the present (Faddeev-type) approach to the N-body problem is that the potentials do not appear explicitly; they have been formally eliminated in favor of the two-body scattering amplitudes. In addition to the integral equations for the scattering amplitudes, in all channels, we obtain integral equations for the wave function and for the effective (or optical) potential. A minimum principle for the effective potential obtained previously for N= 3 is generalized to arbitrary N. To \u2026",
