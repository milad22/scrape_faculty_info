            "Crystalline open-framework and nanoporous materials have long attracted the attention of chemists, physicists, and materials scientists. The intriguing structures such materials exhibit are often intimately related to the unique physical properties they possess. This article reviews recent developments in the preparation and characterization of one such class of inorganic materials, those comprised of group 14 elements crystallizing with the clathrate-II crystal structure. These materials correspond to expanded forms and, in some cases, metastable allotropes of Si, Ge, and Sn. Just as interesting as the structure and properties that group 14 clathrate-II materials display is the diverse range of synthetic techniques used to prepare them and these techniques are discussed. We review the work to date characterizing the physical properties of group 14 clathrate-II materials with emphasis placed on structure\u2013property \u2026",

Twenty years later, the PGEC concept remains a strong driver in thermoelectric materials research that has the potential to broaden commercial use of devices capable of direct conversion of waste heat to electricity. Indeed, finding robust materials that satisfy the necessary criteria (Box 1) and that can be produced easily and inexpensively has proven a non-trivial roadblock to the widespread use of thermoelectric technology for the past 70 years.Thermal conductivity is one of the key material design parameters that influence thermoelectric device performance (Box 1).

In these materials, Sb substitutes for Si in the antifluorite structure. As the Sb content increases, vacancies are formed in the lattice on Mg sites, which also contribute to variations in the transport properties. With increasing Sb content, both the absolute Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity first decrease, but then increase due to vacancy formation, while the thermal conductivity decreases monotonically with increasing Sb content. We investigate the lattice thermal conductivity by modeling the data using the Debye approximation in order to discern the contributions from different phonon-scattering mechanisms. We discuss the results in the context of potential thermoelectric applications.",
