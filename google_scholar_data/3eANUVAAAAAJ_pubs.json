            "When light is incident on a medium with a spatially disordered index of refraction, interference effects lead to near-perfect reflection when the number of dielectric interfaces is large, so that the medium becomes a \u201ctransparent mirror.\u201d We investigate the analog of this effect for electrons in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), for which local fluctuations of the twist angle give rise to a spatially random Fermi velocity. In a description that includes only spatial variation of Fermi velocity, we derive the incident-angle-dependent localization length for the case of quasi-one-dimensional disorder by mapping this problem onto a one-dimensional Anderson localization. The localization length diverges at normal incidence as a consequence of Klein tunneling, leading to a power-law decay of the transmission when averaged over incidence angle. In a minimal model of TBG, the modulation of twist angle also shifts the location of the \u2026",
