            "We present a fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of the solar corona and solar wind with turbulence transport and heating. The model is based on Reynolds-averaged solar wind equations coupled with transport equations for turbulence energy, cross helicity, and correlation scale. The model includes separate energy equations for protons and electrons and accounts for the effects of electron heat conduction, radiative cooling, Coulomb collisions, Reynolds stresses, eddy viscosity, and turbulent heating of protons and electrons. The computational domain extends from the coronal base to 5 au and is divided into two regions: the inner (coronal) region, 1\u201330 R\u2609, and the outer (solar wind) region, 30 R\u2609\u20135 au. Numerical steady-state solutions in both regions are constructed by time relaxation in the frame of reference corotating with the Sun. Inner boundary conditions are specified using either a \u2026",

            "The investigation of the diffusive transport of charged particles in a turbulent magnetic field remains a subject of considerable interest. Research has most frequently concentrated on determining the diffusion coefficient in the presence of a mean magnetic field. Here we consider the diffusion of charged particles in fully three-dimensional isotropic turbulent magnetic fields with no mean field, which may be pertinent to many astrophysical situations. We identify different ranges of particle energy depending upon the ratio of Larmor radius to the characteristic outer length scale of turbulence. Two different theoretical models are proposed to calculate the diffusion coefficient, each applicable to a distinct range of particle energies. The theoretical results are compared to those from computer simulations, showing good agreement.",

At the energy-containing scale, the energy budget is controlled by the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n decay law. Inertial range cascade is estimated by fitting a linear scaling to the mixed third-order structure function. Finally, we use a multi-spacecraft technique to estimate the Kolmogorov\u2013Yaglom-like cascade rate in the kinetic range, well below the ion inertial length scale, where we expect a reduction due to involvement of other channels of transfer.

We report the first turbulence studies of ion and electron velocity moments accumulated in pristine solar wind by the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) instrument on board the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission. Use of these data is made possible by a novel implementation of a frequency domain Hampel filter, described herein. After presenting procedures for processing of the data, we discuss statistical properties of solar wind turbulence extending into the kinetic range. Magnetic field fluctuations dominate electron and ion-velocity fluctuation spectra throughout the energy-containing and inertial ranges.

Simulation results specify background solar wind fields and turbulence parameters, which are used to compute diffusion coefficients and study their behavior in the inner heliosphere. The parallel mean free path (mfp) is evaluated using quasi-linear theory, while the perpendicular mfp is determined from nonlinear guiding center theory with the random ballistic interpretation.

However, quantitative measures of Alfv\u00e9nicity are needed to understand how the characterization of these fluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the inner and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low latitudes.

In this paper, we examine the dissipation rates for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with an increasing Reynolds number and in the presence of a mean magnetic field of varying strength. Proceeding numerically, we find that, as the Reynolds number increases, the dissipation rate asymptotes to a finite value for each magnetic-field strength, confirming the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-Howarth hypothesis as applied to MHD.
