            "The study of tin oxide is motivated by its applications as a solid state gas sensor material, oxidation catalyst, and transparent conductor. This review describes the physical and chemical properties that make tin oxide a suitable material for these purposes. The emphasis is on surface science studies of single crystal surfaces, but selected studies on powder and polycrystalline films are also incorporated in order to provide connecting points between surface science studies with the broader field of materials science of tin oxide. The key for understanding many aspects of SnO2 surface properties is the dual valency of Sn. The dual valency facilitates a reversible transformation of the surface composition from stoichiometric surfaces with Sn4+ surface cations into a reduced surface with Sn2+ surface cations depending on the oxygen chemical potential of the system. Reduction of the surface modifies the surface electronic \u2026",

            "The prototypical photocatalyst TiO 2 exists in different polymorphs, the most common forms are the anatase-and rutile-crystal structures. Generally, anatase is more active than rutile, but no consensus exists to explain this difference. Here we demonstrate that it is the bulk transport of excitons to the surface that contributes to the difference. Utilizing high\u2013quality epitaxial TiO 2 films of the two polymorphs we evaluate the photocatalytic activity as a function of TiO 2-film thickness. For anatase the activity increases for films up to~ 5 nm thick, while rutile films reach their maximum activity for~ 2.5 nm films already. This shows that charge carriers excited deeper in the bulk contribute to surface reactions in anatase than in rutile. Furthermore, we measure surface orientation dependent activity on rutile single crystals. The pronounced orientation-dependent activity can also be correlated to anisotropic bulk charge carrier \u2026",

The scope of this work is further narrowed by concentrating on graphene grown at transition metal surfaces, mostly under vacuum conditions, and neglecting other graphene synthesis approaches, namely growth on SiC or by graphene oxide reduction. Thus one large section of this review focuses on metal\/graphene interfaces. We summarize recent surface science studies on the structure, interaction, and the growth of graphene on various metals.

No band gap narrowing is observed, but N doping induces localized N 2 p states within the band gap just above the valence band. N is present in a N (III) valence state, which facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ti 3 d band gap states at elevated temperatures. The increased O vacancy formation triggers the 1\u00d7 2 reconstruction of the rutile (110) surface. This thermal instability may degrade the catalyst during applications.",

Here, we report the existence of a dopant-free, pure TiO 2 phase with a narrow bandgap. This new pure TiO 2 phase forms on the surface of rutile TiO 2 (011) by oxidation of bulk titanium interstitials.

The chemical interaction between graphene and nickel is due to hybridization of the metal d-electrons with the \u03c0-orbitals of graphene. This interaction causes a smaller separation between the nickel surface and graphene (0.21 nm) than the typical van der Waals gap-distance between graphitic layers (0.33 nm). Furthermore, the physical properties of graphene are significantly altered. Main differences are the opening of a band gap in the electronic structure and a shifting of the \u03c0-band by \u223c2 eV below the Fermi-level. Experimental evidence suggests that the ferromagnetic nickel induces a magnetic moment in the carbon. Substrate induced geometric and electronic changes alter the phonon dispersion.
