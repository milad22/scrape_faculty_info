            "Metastable Intermolecular Composites or so-called Nanoenergetic Materials have been widely touted for their potential to fulfill dreams in high density energetic materials and nanotechnology. They are likely to become the next-generation explosives, propellants and primes as they enable flexibility in energy density and power release through control of particle size, tunable stoichiometry and choice of fuel and oxidizer. Despite intense examination by scientists and engineers worldwide the temperature progress and velocity of the thermal front propagation on the nanostructured formulations, however, gas pressure evolution and rate of gas release are not well investigated and understood. This issue has seriously impeded realization of various potential emerging applications envisioned in rocket solid fuels and explosives, which require a high pressure discharge in a short period of time as well as in bio-defeat \u2026",

The velocity of the downwards moving temperature front exceeds that of the upstream front bounding the hot zone. The number of ignition points increases as the PM loading is decreased. The highest temperature rise is obtained by a downward moving hot zone. Avoiding this mode of combustion decreases the probability of excessive hot zone formation during the PM regeneration.",

The experiments revealed that the maximum soot layer temperature occurred at the gas\u2013soot interface. At soot loading of 10 g\/L or less the temperature differences across the soot layer are rather small (usually less than 10 \u00b0C). Higher values may be obtained at higher soot loading. For example, a 40 \u00b0C difference was observed at a loading of 20 g\/L.
