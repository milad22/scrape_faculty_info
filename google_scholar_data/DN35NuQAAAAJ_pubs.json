A magnetic field B defines the axis of quantization, and an electric field E, parallel to B, is applied in the region between the oscillating fields. Laser optical pumping is used for state selection and analysis, and the signal is fluorescence accompanying the decay of excited atoms in the analyzer region. The signature of a nonzero electric dipole moment is a dependence of the signal on the P, T-odd rotational invariant E\u22c5 B (P and T denote parity and time reversal, respectively).

Distinct protrusions, known as \u201cflower\u201d structures, were observed on flat terraces, which are attributed to carbon structures that depart from the characteristic honeycomb lattice.

            "An ideal technique for observing nanoscale assembly would provide atomic-resolution images of both the products and the reactants in real time. Using a transmission electron microscope we image in situ the electrochemical deposition of lead from an aqueous solution of lead(II) nitrate. Both the lead deposits and the local Pb2+ concentration can be visualized. Depending on the rate of potential change and the potential history, lead deposits on the cathode in a structurally compact layer or in dendrites. In both cases the deposits can be removed and the process repeated. Asperities that persist through many plating and stripping cycles consistently nucleate larger dendrites. Quantitative digital image analysis reveals excellent correlation between changes in the Pb2+ concentration, the rate of lead deposition, and the current passed by the electrochemical cell.
