            "We consider an infinitely repeated Bertrand game, in which prices are publicly observed and each firm receives a privately observed, i.i.d. cost shock in each period. We focus on symmetric perfect public equilibria, wherein any \u201cpunishments\u201d are borne equally by all firms. We identify a tradeoff that is associated with collusive pricing schemes in which the price to be charged by each firm is strictly increasing in its cost level: such \u201cfully sorting\u201d schemes offer efficiency benefits, as they ensure that the lowest-cost firm makes the current sale, but they also imply an informational cost (distorted pricing and\/or equilibrium-path price wars), since a higher-cost firm must be deterred from mimicking a lower-cost firm by charging a lower price. A rigid-pricing scheme, where a firm's collusive price is independent of its current cost position, sacrifices efficiency benefits but also diminishes the informational cost.

Social control, many scholars have noted, is often achieved through social norms-informal, decentralized systems of consensus and cooperation rather than through law. This literature also displays a guarded optimism that social evolutionary processes will tend to favor the adoption of efficient norms. Using concepts from evolutionary game theory, we demonstrate that efficient norms will prevail only in certain settings and not in others: survival of the fittest does not imply survival of the efficient. In particular, we show that in many games of interest to legal scholars-games describing fundamental interactions in property, tort, and contract-evolutionary forces lead away from efficiency. We also describe how law rights this trend.",

Commentators suggest, however, that self-auditing is not as common as it should be, because firms fear that what they find will be used against them. This article analyzes self-auditing as a two-tiered incentive problem involving incentives both to test for and to effect compliance. After demonstrating the inadequacy of conventional remedies, we show that incentives can be properly aligned by conditioning fines on firms' investigative effort. In practice, however, the regulator may not be able to observe such effort. Accordingly, we propose and evaluate the use of three observable proxies for self-investigation: the manner in which the regulator detected the violation; the firm's own disclosure of violations; and the firm's observed corrective actions.

            "This article investigates the role of evidence production in the regulation of private behavior via judicial and administrative process. It proposes a model in which the law makes the agent's \u201cfine\u201d depend on the presentation of evidence whose production cost, in turn, depends on how the agent has behaved in the regulated activity. This view of evidence production has several notable implications, including that truth finding has no direct role in deterrence, that nonfalsifiable evidence, even when available, is unlikely to be the best choice for the system, and that \u201coverdeterrence\u201d may well be cost\u2010effective.",
