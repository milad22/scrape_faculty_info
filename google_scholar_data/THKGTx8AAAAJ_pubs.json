            "Platelet aggregation at sites of vascular injury is essential for hemostasis and arterial thrombosis. It has long been assumed that platelet aggregation and thrombus growth are initiated by soluble agonists generated at sites of vascular injury. By using high-resolution intravital imaging techniques and hydrodynamic analyses, we show that platelet aggregation is primarily driven by changes in blood flow parameters (rheology), with soluble agonists having a secondary role, stabilizing formed aggregates. We find that in response to vascular injury, thrombi initially develop through the progressive stabilization of discoid platelet aggregates. Analysis of blood flow dynamics revealed that discoid platelets preferentially adhere in low-shear zones at the downstream face of forming thrombi, with stabilization of aggregates dependent on the dynamic restructuring of membrane tethers. These findings provide insight into the \u2026",

            "Platelet aggregation, the process by which platelets adhere to each other at sites of vascular injury, has long been recognized as critical for hemostatic plug formation and thrombosis. Until relatively recently, platelet aggregation was considered a straightforward process involving the noncovalent bridging of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptors on the platelet surface by the dimeric adhesive protein fibrinogen. However, with recent technical advances enabling real-time analysis of platelet aggregation in vivo, it has become apparent that this process is much more complex and dynamic than previously anticipated. Over the last decade, it has become clear that platelet aggregation represents a multistep adhesion process involving distinct receptors and adhesive ligands, with the contribution of individual receptor-ligand interactions to the aggregation process dependent on the prevailing blood flow conditions.

In particular, the importance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in promoting both primary adhesion and aggregation under high shear conditions is now well established. In general, the efficiency with which platelets adhere and aggregate at sites of vessel wall injury is dependent on the synergistic action of various adhesive and soluble agonist receptors, with the contribution of each of the individual receptors dependent on the prevailing blood flow conditions. In this review, we will discuss the major platelet adhesive interactions regulating platelet thrombus formation under high shear, with specific focus on the VWF (GPIb and integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23) and collagen receptors (GPVI and integrin \u03b12\u03b21).

Our studies demonstrate an unexpected complexity to the platelet aggregation process in which platelets in flowing blood continuously tether, translocate, and\/or detach from the luminal surface of a growing platelet thrombus at both arterial and venous shear rates. Studies of platelets congenitally deficient in von Willebrand factor (vWf) or integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 demonstrated a key role for platelet vWf in mediating platelet tethering and translocation, whereas integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediated cell arrest.

Treatment of platelets with ABT-737 triggered PS exposure and a marked increase in thrombin generation in vitro.

            "The central importance of platelets in the development of arterial thrombosis and cardiovascular disease is well established. No other single cell type is responsible for as much morbidity and mortality as the platelet and, as a consequence, it represents a major target for therapeutic intervention. The growing awareness of the importance of platelets is reflected in the increasing number of patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, a trend that is likely to continue in the future. There are, however, significant drawbacks with existing therapies, including issues related to limited efficacy and safety. The discovery of a'magic bullet'that selectively targets pathological thrombus formation without undermining haemostasis remains elusive, although recent progress in unravelling the molecular events regulating thrombosis has provided promising new avenues to solve this long-standing problem.",
