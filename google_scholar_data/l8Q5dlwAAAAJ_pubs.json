For example, a CH3 (1: 3: 3: 1) quartet becomes an enhanced 1: 3: 3: 1 quartet, as shown in Fig. 1. The enhancement can be varied uniformly, ie, the same for each line within a multiple& by adjusting 8.(c) The variation with B for CH, CH2, and CH3 have the following mathematical dependencies: sin 0 for CH; sin 28 for CH2; and sin 8+ sin 319 for CH3. As a consequence, CH2 and CH3 signals are zero when 8= 7r\/2 and CH2 signals are inverted by changing 0 from 7r \u2026",

            "The usual mathematical model of the single-mode electromagnetic field is the harmonic oscillator with an infinite-dimensional state space, which unfortunately cannot accommodate the existence of a Hermitian phase operator. Recently we indicated that this difficulty may be circumvented by using an alternative, and physically indistinguishable, mathematical model of the single-mode field involving a finite but arbitrarily large state space, the dimension of which is allowed to tend to infinity after physically measurable results, such as expectation values, are calculated. In this paper we investigate the properties of a Hermitian phase operator which follows directly and uniquely from the form of the phase states in this space and find them to be well behaved. The phase-number commutator is not subject to the difficulties inherent in Dirac\u2019s original commutator, but still preserves the commutator\u2013Poisson-bracket \u2026",

It is shown that the pulse train produces an enhanced distortion\u2010free 13C signal which has the following characteristics: (a) there is phase coherency within and between the components of the 13C multiplets; (b) the enhancements vary with \u03d1 as (\u03b3H\/\u03b3C)sin\u2009\u03d1 for CH, (\u03b3H\/\u03b3C)sin\u20092\u03d1 for CH2, and (3\u03b3H\/4\u03b3C) (sin\u2009\u03d1+sin 3\u03d1) for CH3.

The phase operator cannot be represented exactly in the usual-infinite Hilbert space but can be constructed in a subspace of it and provides a valid representation of phase if used together with a suitable limiting procedure.
