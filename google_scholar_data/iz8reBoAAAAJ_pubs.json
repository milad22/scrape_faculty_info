            "The sixth blind test of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods has been held, with five target systems: a small nearly rigid molecule, a polymorphic former drug candidate, a chloride salt hydrate, a co-crystal and a bulky flexible molecule. This blind test has seen substantial growth in the number of participants, with the broad range of prediction methods giving a unique insight into the state of the art in the field. Significant progress has been seen in treating flexible molecules, usage of hierarchical approaches to ranking structures, the application of density-functional approximations, and the establishment of new workflows and `best practices' for performing CSP calculations. All of the targets, apart from a single potentially disordered Z\u2032 = 2 polymorph of the drug candidate, were predicted by at least one submission. Despite many remaining challenges, it is clear that CSP methods are becoming more \u2026",

It is found that the main role of the van der Waals forces is to anchor the layers at a fixed distance, whereas the electrostatic forces dictate the optimal stacking mode and the interlayer sliding energy. A nearly free-sliding path is identified, along which band gap modulations of\u223c 0.6 eV are obtained. We propose a simple geometric model that quantifies the registry matching between the layers and captures the essence of the corrugated h\u2212 BN interlayer energy landscape. The simplicity of this phenomenological model opens the way to the modeling of complex layered structures, such as carbon and boron nitride nanotubes.",

A hierarchy of G W methods exists, starting from non-self-consistent G 0 W 0, through partial self-consistency in the eigenvalues and in the Green's function (sc G W 0), to fully self-consistent G W (sc G W). Here, we assess the performance of these methods for benzene, pyridine, and the diazines. The quasiparticle spectra are compared to photoemission spectroscopy (PES) experiments with respect to all measured particle removal energies and the ordering of the frontier orbitals. We find that the accuracy of the calculated spectra does not match the expectations based on their level of self-consistency.

However, treatment of London dispersion is inherently outside the reach of (semi)local approximations to the exchange-correlation functional as well as of conventional hybrid density functionals based on semilocal correlation. Here, we offer an approach that provides a treatment of both dispersive interactions and the electronic structure within a computationally tractable scheme. The approach is based on adding the leading interatomic London dispersion term via pairwise ion\u2212ion interactions to a suitably chosen nonempirical hybrid functional, with the dispersion coefficients and van der Waals radii determined from first-principles using the recently proposed \u201cTS-vdW\u201d scheme (Tkatchenko, A.; Scheffler, M.
