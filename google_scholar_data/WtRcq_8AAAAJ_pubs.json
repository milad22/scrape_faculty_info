            "In this work, we construct time-dependent wormhole solutions in the context of f(R) theory of gravity. The background matter is considered to be traceless. By considering specific shape function and power-law expansion, exact solutions for f(R) are found. The null and the weak energy conditions (NEC and WEC) are checked for wormhole solutions. It is shown that the matter threading the wormhole spacetimes with either accelerated expansion or decelerated expansion satisfies the NEC and WEC.",

It is shown that the wormhole can be derived from a particular f(R) model in the radiation background. Moreover, it has been shown that the field equations can be cast to a similar form  at the apparent horizon for the evolving Lorentzian wormhole. Compared to the case of Einstein's general relativity, an additional term  appears here.",
