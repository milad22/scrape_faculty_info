            "Research on \u201cepistemological beliefs\u201d has made important contributions to education, most fundamentally in identifying epistemology as a category of informal knowledge that may play a role in students\u2019 knowledge, reasoning, study strategies, and participation. A perspective on students as having epistemological beliefs can provide an alternative interpretive lens for teachers to use in understanding their students\u2019 ideas and behavior, in assessing students\u2019 abilities and needs, and in adapting their plans and strategies for instruction. This value of the perspective in opening a new category of instructional perception and intention has not been sensitive to the details of the perspective. At this point, however, further progress will depend on those details. In this chapter, we contend that current perspectives on epistemologies are problematic in their form, or \u201contology.\u201d We will focus our arguments primarily on epistemological beliefs about science and science learning, specifically in introductory physics, but our contentions apply to beliefs in other disciplines as well. The study of epistemologies has largely emulated the study of \u201cconceptual understanding,\u201d which has established that students have informal knowledge, about",

            "As researchers studying student reasoning in introductory physics, and as instructors teaching courses, we often focus on whether and how students apply what they know in one context to their reasoning in another. But we do not speak in terms of \u201ctransfer.\u201d The term connotes to us a unitary view of knowledge as a thing that is acquired in one context and carried (or not) to another. We speak, rather, in terms of activating resources, a language with an explicitly manifold view of cognitive structure. In this chapter, we describe this view and argue that it provides a more firm and generative basis for research.In particular, our resources-based perspective accounts for why it is difficult, and perhaps unnecessary, to draw a boundary around the notion of \u201ctransfer\u201d; provides an analytical framework for exploring the differences between active transfer involving metacognition and passive transfer that \u201cjust happens\u201d; helps to explain many results in the transfer literature, such as the rar-",

            "Research on personal epistemologies has begun to consider ontology: Do naive epistemologies take the form of stable, unitary beliefs or of fine-grained, context-sensitive resources? Debates such as this regarding subtleties of cognitive theory, however, may be difficult to connect to everyday instructional practice. Our purpose in this article is to make that connection. We first review reasons for supporting the latter account, of naive epistemologies as made up of fine-grained, context-sensitive resources; as part of this argument we note that familiar strategies and curricula tacitly ascribe epistemological resources to students. We then present several strategies designed more explicitly to help students tap those resources for learning introductory physics. Finally, we reflect on this work as an example of interplay between 2 modes of inquiry into student thinking, that of instruction and that of formal research on learning.",

According to this community consensus, students should understand scientific knowledge as tentative and evolving, rather than certain and unchanging; subjectively tied to scientists' perspectives, rather than objectively inherent in nature; and individually or socially constructed, rather than discovered. Surveys, interview protocols, and other methods used to probe students' beliefs about scientific knowledge broadly reflect this outlook. This article questions the community consensus about epistemological sophistication. We do not suggest that scientific knowledge is objective and fixed; if forced to choose whether knowledge is certain or tentative, with no opportunity to elaborate, we would choose \u201ctentative.\u201d Instead, our critique consists of two lines of \u2026",

To make this argument, we first review and extend the resources perspective to include epistemological framing (Hammer, Elby, Scherr, & Redish, 2005; Redish, 2004), which corresponds closely to the phenomena of coherent personal epistemologies documented in the literature (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997).

            "Using written questionnaires, I surveyed introductory physics students about how they study and about how they would advise a hypothetical student to study if she were trying to learn physics deeply with no grade pressure. The survey teases apart students\u2019 \u201cepistemological\u201d beliefs about learning and understanding physics from their more course-specific beliefs about how to earn high grades. The results indicate that students perceive \u201ctrying to understand physics well\u201d to be a significantly different activity from \u201ctrying to do well in the course.\u201d",

            "This article pulls into the empirical realm a longstanding theoretical debate about the prior knowledge students bring to bear when learning scientific concepts and representations. Misconceptions constructivists view the prior knowledge as stable alternate conceptions that apply robustly across multiple contexts. By contrast, fine-grained constructivists believe that much of students' intuitive knowledge consists of unarticulated, loosely connected knowledge elements, the activation of which depends sensitively on context. By focusing on students' intuitive knowledge about representations, and by fleshing out the two constructivist frameworks, I show that they lead to empirically different sets of predictions. Pilot studies demonstrate the feasibility of a full-fledged experimental program to decide which flavor of constructivism describes students more adequately.",
