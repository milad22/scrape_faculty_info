Although regional fibrosis is easily imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance, there is currently no noninvasive method for quantifying diffuse myocardial fibrosis.We performed CMRI on 45 subjects (25 patients with heart failure, 20 control patients), on a clinical 1.5-T CMRI scanner. A prototype T1 mapping sequence was used to calculate the post-contrast myocardial T1 time as an index of diffuse fibrosis; regional fibrosis was identified by delayed contrast enhancement. Regional and global systolic function was assessed by cine CMRI in standard \u2026",

We investigated the clinical utility of an approach combining both techniques to differentiate acute from chronic MI.Methods and Results\u2014 Seventy-three MI patients were studied in 2 groups. Group A consisted of 15 acute MI patients who were studied twice, on day 1 and 3 months after MI. In group B, 58 patients with acute or chronic MI underwent 1 CMR scan. T2-weighted and DE images of matched slices were acquired on a 1.5-T system.

Parametric mapping with CMR now permits the routine spatial visualization and quantification of changes in myocardial composition based on changes in T1, T2, and T2*(star) relaxation times and extracellular volume (ECV). These changes include specific disease pathways related to mainly intracellular disturbances of the cardiomyocyte (e.g., iron overload, or glycosphingolipid accumulation in Anderson-Fabry disease); extracellular disturbances in the myocardial interstitium (e.g., myocardial fibrosis or cardiac amyloidosis from accumulation of collagen or amyloid proteins, respectively); or both (myocardial edema with increased intracellular and\/or extracellular water). Parametric mapping promises improvements in patient care through advances in quantitative diagnostics, inter- and intra-patient comparability, and relatedly improvements in treatment. There is a multitude of technical approaches and potential applications. This document provides a summary of the existing evidence for the clinical value of parametric mapping in the heart as of mid 2017, and gives recommendations for practical use in different clinical scenarios for scientists, clinicians, and CMR manufacturers.",

Using a novel method of estimating end-systolic wall stress (ES-\u03c3), we compared the RV and LV during exercise and assessed whether this influenced chronic ventricular remodeling in athletes. METHODS: For this study, 39 endurance athletes (EA) and 14 nonathletes (NA) underwent resting cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2), and exercise echocardiography studies. LV and RV end-systolic wall stress (ES-\u03c3) were calculated using the Laplace relation (ES-\u03c3= Pr\/(2h)). Ventricular size and wall thickness were determined by CMR; invasive and Doppler echo estimates were used to measure systemic and pulmonary ventricular pressures, respectively; and stroke volume was quantified by Doppler echocardiography and used to calculate changes in ventricular geometry during exercise. RESULTS: In EA, compared with NA, resting CMR measures showed greater RV than LV remodeling. The ratios RV ESV\/LV ESV (1.40\u00b10.23 vs 1.26\u00b10.12, P= 0.007) and RV mass\/LV mass (0.29\u00b10.04 vs 0.25\u00b10.03, P= 0.012) were greater in EA than in NA. RVES-\u03c3 was lower at rest than LVES-\u03c3 (143\u00b144 vs 252\u00b149 kdyn\u00b7 cm, P< 0.001) but increased more with strenuous exercise (125% vs 14%, P< 0.001), resulting in similar peak exercise ES-\u03c3 (321\u00b1106 vs 286\u00b177 kdyn\u00b7 cm, P= 0.058). Peak exercise RVES-\u03c3 was greater in EA than in NA (340\u00b1107 vs 266\u00b182 kdyn\u00b7 cm, P= 0.028), whereas RVES-\u03c3 at matched absolute workloads did not differ (P= 0.79 \u2026",

This possibility has driven the growing interest in quantifying T1, rather than just relying on its effect on image contrast. The techniques have advanced to where pixel-level myocardial T1 mapping has become a routine component of CMR examinations. Combined with the use of contrast agents, T1 mapping has led an expansive investigation of interstitial remodeling in ischemic and nonischemic heart disease. The purpose of this review was to introduce the reader to the physical principles of T1 mapping, the imaging techniques developed for T1 mapping, the pathophysiological markers accessible by T1 mapping, and its clinical uses.",
