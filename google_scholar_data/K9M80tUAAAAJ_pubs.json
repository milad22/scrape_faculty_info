We find a clear break in the optical Tully\u2010Fisher relation: field galaxies with   fall below the relation defined by brighter galaxies. These faint galaxies, however, are very rich in gas; adding in the gas mass and plotting the baryonic disk mass   in place of luminosity restores the single linear relation. The Tully\u2010Fisher relation thus appears fundamentally to be a relation between rotation velocity and total baryonic mass of the form  .",

There are substantial selection effects against the discovery of galaxies that are unevolved or diffuse; these systems are missing from most wide field catalogs. Low surface brightness galaxies make up a significant amount of the luminosity density of the local universe. They contribute substantial but poorly determined amounts to the census of baryons and dark matter. Low surface brightness galaxies are also relevant to the interpretation of quasar absorption lines and to the understanding of rapidly evolving galaxy populations in the more distant universe.

            "Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies appear to have low star formation rates despite their often quite normal HI contents as judged from global HI properties such as MH I\/L and MH I\/MT ratios. HI imaging with the Very Large Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (the NRAO is operated by Associated Universities Inc. under contract with the National Science Foundation) of eight LSB galaxies shows that the H1 is extended compared with the optical size and has average surface densities which are about a factor 2 lower than in High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies of the same type. The resolution of the H I imaging allows a rough rotation curve analysis for evaluating the critical density for star formation as formulated by Kennicutt [ApJ, 344, 685 (1989)]. The observed HI surface densities systematically fall below this critical density for most of the galaxies in this sample, in agreement with the low \u2026",

            "Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies are galaxies dominated by an exponential disc whose central surface brightness is much fainter than the value of \u03bcB(0) = 21.65 \u00b1 0.30 mag arcsec\u22122 found by Freeman. In this paper we present broadband photometry of a sample of 21 late-type LSB galaxies. The median central surface brightness of the sample is \u03bcB(0) = 23.2 mag arcsec\u22122 and the median scale length is 3.2 kpc, showing that LSB galaxies are normal-sized galaxies. We find colours that are comparable to or bluer than those of the more widely studied \u2018normal\u2019 high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies. LSB galaxies are therefore not faded discs that have no current star formation. The colours cannot on the other hand be ascribed entirely to metallicity effects, but we can explain them by assuming a sporadic star formation rate scenario. LSB galaxies hence appear to be unevolved and quiescent objects \u2026",

A broad variety of empirical and theoretical data are discussed here, and the data are made fully available in the AAS CD-ROM Series, Vo. 7. Several empirical stellar libraries are part of this database. They cover the ultraviolet spectral range observed with IUE, optical data from different ground-based telescopes, and ground-based infrared data. Spectral type coverage depends on the wavelength, but it is mostly complete for types O and M and luminosity classes V to I. A large metallicity range is covered as well. Theoretical libraries of selected spectral indices of cool stars and of stellar continuum fluxes in the temperature range 2000 K to 50,000 K, as well as Wolf-Rayet energy distributions are presented.
