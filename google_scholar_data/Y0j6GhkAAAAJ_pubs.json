Both structures show large, aperiodic, conductance fluctuations as a function of perpendicular magnetic field, and a zero-field resistance peak indicating geometry-dependent enhanced backscattering. Power spectra of fluctuations are consistent with recent semiclassical analyses based on quantum chaotic scattering, with the circle showing enhanced high-frequency spectral content.",

However, constructing nanotube-based electronic devices requires a controlled means of assembling the tubes. We report procedures both for producing individual short SWNT segments and for their reliable deposition on chemically functionalized nanolithographic templates. Using this method, we have positioned individual nanotubes at specific locations and orientations in such a way that the nanotubes contact metal electrodes. This discovery is potentially very important for fabrication of simple electrical circuits with nanotubes, and provides a new tool for study of electron transport in nanotubes.",

Although there is ample experimental evidence that such correlations exist 2, electron dynamics in engineered nanostructures have been observed directly only on long timescales 3. The faster dynamics associated with electrical currents or charge fluctuations 4 are usually inferred from direct (or quasi-direct) current measurements. Recently, interest in electron dynamics has risen, in part owing to the realization that additional information about electronic interactions can be found in the shot noise 5 or higher statistical moments 6, 7 of a direct current. Furthermore, interest in quantum computation has stimulated investigation of quantum bit (qubit) readout techniques 8, 9, which for many condensed-matter systems ultimately reduces to single-shot measurements of individual \u2026",

            "Spin blockade occurs when an electron is unable to access an energetically favourable path through a quantum dot owing to spin conservation, resulting in a blockade of the current through the dot 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Spin blockade is the basis of a number of recent advances in spintronics, including the measurement and the manipulation of individual electron spins 7, 8. We report measurements of the spin blockade regime in a silicon double quantum dot, revealing a complementary phenomenon: lifetime-enhanced transport. We argue that our observations arise because the decay times for electron spins in silicon are long, enabling the electron to maintain its spin throughout its transit across the quantum dot and access fast paths that exist in some spin channels but not in others. Such long spin lifetimes are important for applications such as quantum computation and, more generally, spintronics.",
