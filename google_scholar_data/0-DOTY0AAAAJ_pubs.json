            "Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a leading method for studying long-time dynamics and elasticity of biomolecules. The method proceeds from complex semiempirical potentials characterizing the covalent and noncovalent interactions between atoms. It is widely accepted that such detailed potentials are essential to the success of NMA's. We show that a single-parameter potential is sufficient to reproduce the slow dynamics in good detail. Costly and inaccurate energy minimizations are eliminated, permitting direct analysis of crystal coordinates. The technique can be used for new applications, such as mapping of one crystal form to another by means of slow modes, and studying anomalous dynamics of large proteins and complexes.",

The slowest frequency normal modes of G-actin pertain to collective rearrangements of domains, motions that are characterized by correlation lengths on the order of the resolution of the fiber diffraction data. Using a small number of normal mode degrees of freedom (< or = 12) improved the fit to the data significantly. The refined model of F-actin shows that the nucleotide binding cleft has narrowed and that the DNase I binding loop has twisted to a lower radius, consistent with other refinement techniques and electron microscopy data.

The internal co-ordinates consisted of 1373 single bond torsions, plus an additional 11 torsions to parameterize the motion of the nucleotide and cation with respect to the protein. A generalized eigenvalue problem was solved to yield a complete description of the motion in the 0\u00b71 to 17\u00b70 picosecond time range. The modes were visualized using an interactive graphics routine. The softest, slowest modes include a propeller-like twisting of the large and small domain about the phosphate binding loops, a rolling of subdomain 4 about an \u03b1-helix axis and a scissor-type opening and closing of the ADP-binding cleft. The computed temperature factors agree well with experimental ones. A comparable analysis done on G-actin-ATP shows that the softest modes are \u2026",

The computations reveal modes of motion characteristic to all polymers, such as longitudinal pressure waves, torsional waves, and bending, as well as motions unique to F-actin. Motions typical to actin include a \"groove-swinging\" motion of the two long-pitch helices, as well as an axial slipping motion of the two strands.

We demonstrate the usefulness of NMA by the example of a large globular protein, G-actin, and the filaments it forms: F-actin. We also discuss some less known aspects of NMA: (a) The density of modes of globular proteins departs from Debye\u2019s prediction for solids, and is anomalous. (b) The use of dihedral angles, rather than Cartesian degrees of freedom, gives rise to interesting nonlinear effects, such as oscillations of certain subsets at twice the natural frequency of the mode.

            "Statistical models of fission angular distributions predict that the spins of the fragments should vary with angle. This effect has been investigated in several 4He-induced fission reactions using \u03b3-ray multiplicity techniques. While M\u03b3 does vary with emission angle, the effect is smaller than expected. The excitation of additional angular momentum bearing modes accounts for much of this discrepancy.",
