            "This paper describes the open-source code Enzo, which uses block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to provide high spatial and temporal resolution for modeling astrophysical fluid flows. The code is Cartesian, can be run in one, two, and three dimensions, and supports a wide variety of physics including hydrodynamics, ideal and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, N-body dynamics (and, more broadly, self-gravity of fluids and particles), primordial gas chemistry, optically thin radiative cooling of primordial and metal-enriched plasmas (as well as some optically-thick cooling models), radiation transport, cosmological expansion, and models for star formation and feedback in a cosmological context. In addition to explaining the algorithms implemented, we present solutions for a wide range of test problems, demonstrate the code's parallel performance, and discuss the Enzo collaboration's code development \u2026",

Population II stars with lower characteristic masses form when the star-forming gas reaches a critical metallicity of 10\u20136-10\u20133.5 Z\u2609. We present an adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows the transition from Population III to Population II star formation. The maximum spatial resolution of 1 comoving parsec allows for individual molecular clouds to be well resolved and their stellar associations to be studied in detail. We model stellar radiative feedback with adaptive ray tracing. A top-heavy initial mass function for the Population III stars is considered, resulting in a plausible distribution of pair-instability supernovae and associated metal enrichment. We find that the gas fraction recovers from 5% to nearly the \u2026",

We present the statistics of dwarf galaxy properties at z > 7 in haloes with masses up to 109\u2009M\u2299, using a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows their buildup starting with their Population III progenitors. We find that metal-enriched star formation is not restricted to atomic cooling (Tvir\u2009\u2265\u2009104\u2009K) haloes, but can occur in haloes down to masses \u223c106\u2009M\u2299, especially in neutral regions. Even though these smallest galaxies only host up to 104\u2009M\u2299 of stars, they provide nearly 30 per\u2009cent of the ionizing photon budget. We find that the galaxy luminosity function flattens above MUV \u223c \u221212 with a number density that is unchanged at z \u2272 10. The fraction of ionizing radiation escaping into the intergalactic medium is inversely dependent on halo mass, decreasing from 50 to 5 per\u2009cent in the mass range \u2026",

The fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes into the intergalactic medium from dwarf galaxies with masses less than~ 10 9.5 solar masses plays a critical role during this epoch. Using an extensive suite of very high resolution (0.1 pc), adaptive mesh refinement, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of idealized and cosmological dwarf galaxies, we characterize the behavior of the escape fraction in galaxies between 3\u00d7 10 6 and 3\u00d7 10 9 solar masses with different spin parameters, amounts of turbulence, and baryon mass fractions. For a given halo mass, escape fractions can vary up to a factor of two, depending on the initial setup of the idealized halo. In a cosmological setting, we find that the time-averaged photon escape fraction always exceeds 25% and reaches up to 80% in \u2026",

We study remnant black hole growth through accretion, including for the first time the radiation emitted due to accretion, with adaptive mesh refinement cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. The effects of photoionization and heating dramatically affect the large-scale inflow, resulting in negligible mass growth. We compare cases with accretion luminosity included and neglected to show that accretion radiation drastically changes the environment within 100 pc of the black hole, increasing gas temperatures by an order of magnitude. Gas densities are reduced and further star formation in the same minihalo is prevented for the 200 million years we followed. Without radiative feedback \u2026",
