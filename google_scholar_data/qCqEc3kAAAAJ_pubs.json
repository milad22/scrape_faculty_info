            "In this paper the manipulation of power deposition on divertor targets at DIII-D by the application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) for suppression of large type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) is analysed. We discuss the modification of the ELM characteristics by the RMP applied. It is shown that the width of the deposition pattern in ELMy H-mode depends linearly on the ELM deposited energy, whereas in the RMP phase of the discharge those patterns are controlled by the externally induced magnetic perturbation. It was also found that the manipulation of heat transport due to the application of small, edge RMP depends on the plasma pedestal electron collisionality\\nu_ {\\rm e}^\\ast. We compare in this analysis RMP and no RMP phases with and without complete ELM suppression. At high\\nu_ {\\rm e}^\\ast> 0.5, the heat flux during the ELM suppressed phase is of the same order as the inter-ELM and the \u2026",

For both experiments the magnetic field structure is analyzed in the vacuum paradigm\u2014superimposing the external RMP field on the unperturbed equilibrium. For TEXTOR L-mode plasmas this description holds for normalized poloidal flux \u03a8 N> 0.7 without tearing modes driven by the RMP field.

The application of the RMPs to L-mode discharges has shown a clear density pump-out when the field line pitch angle at the low-field side of the plasma is sufficiently well aligned with the applied field. The application of the RMPs before the L\u2013H transition increases the power required to achieve H-mode by at least 30%. In type I ELMing H-mode discharges, at a particular value of q 95, the ELM frequency can be increased by a factor of 5 by the application of the RMPs. This effect on the ELMs and the L-mode density pump-out is not correlated with the width of the region for which the Chirikov parameter, calculated using the vacuum field, is greater than 1 but may be correlated with the size of the resonant component of the applied field in the pedestal region or with the location of the peak plasma \u2026",

This is caused by an edge safety factor q 95 resonant enhancement of the thermal transport, while in contrast, the RMP induced particle pump out does not show a significant resonance. The measured p e reduction correlates to an increase in the modeled stochastic layer width during pitch angle variations matching results from resistive low rotation plasmas at the TEXTOR tokamak. These findings suggest a field line pitch angle resonant formation of a stochastic magnetic edge layer as an explanation for the q 95 resonant character of type-I edge localized mode suppression by RMPs.",

Low wavenumber density turbulence (k\u22a5 \u03c1 i< 1) in the range of 60\u2013300 kHz, measured with beam emission spectroscopy, is modified and generally increases throughout the outer region (0.6< \u03c1< 1.0) of the plasma in response to RMPs over a range of q 95 values; ELM suppression, in contrast, occurs for a narrower range in q 95.
