Using this method, fermionic 6 Li atoms are stored in a 0.4 mK deep well with a 1\/e trap lifetime of 300 sec, consistent with a background pressure of 10\u2212 11 Torr. To our knowledge, this is the longest storage time ever achieved with an all-optical trap, comparable to the best reported magnetic traps.",

            "We present a refractometer based on the principle of total internal reflection that can sensitively record, in real time, the refractive index of fluids over a wide range of refractive indices. The device uses a divergent laser beam and a linear diode array, and has no mechanical or optical moving parts, enabling us to achieve the measurement of a refractive index at a sensitivity level of 10\u22126. Our refractometer does not rely on interferometry, thus enabling the device to be compact, portable, and inexpensive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a noninterferometric device that performs real-time differential refractometry with a sensitivity of better than 10\u22125 has been demonstrated in the literature. We show that our experimental results agree very well with Fresnel theory. We establish a theoretical limit on the sensitivity of this class of refractometers.",
