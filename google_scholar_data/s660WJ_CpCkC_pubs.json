            "On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12: 41: 04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026",

            "A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5\u03c3 evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.",

            "The detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos as cosmic messengers has been an important goal of astroparticle physics. Being stable, electrically neutral particles, high-energy neutrinos are able to propagate almost undisturbed through the universe from their production sites to Earth keeping their directional and energy information. Hence, they constitute excellent cosmic messenger particles, particularly at the highest energies. They arise from weak decays of hadrons, mostly pions and kaons, which are expected to be produced by hadronic interactions of cosmic rays in the surrounding matter of the cosmic-ray accelerator. Their observation will help to elucidate the unknown sources of high-energy cosmic rays (Gaisser et al. 1995; Learned & Mannheim 2000;",
