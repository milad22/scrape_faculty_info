Because the time-to-market dimension of product introduction has become a crucial determinant of multinational corporations\u2019 (MNCs\u2019) competitive advantage, the ability of MNCs to exploit their knowledge globally across subsidiaries using cross-teams has become an important source of competitive advantage. Recognizing the crucial role of MNCs\u2019 knowledge management in NPD, the authors develop a conceptual framework to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of international knowledge acquisition at the cross-team level. The framework suggests that though it is important to acquire necessary knowledge resources for NPD, managers must nurture an NPD project team's realized absorptive capacity to transform the acquired knowledge resources into NPD capabilities, which in turn \u2026",

Using theories from marketing, advertising and consumer behaviour, it postulates that individual companies, such as Taiwan's Acer, may also benefit from the national ad campaign, leading to enhanced country-of-origin effects and global marketing success. While it is difficult to answer satisfactorily the larger theoretical questions of proximate cause and effect between a national image campaign and any presumed spillover effects that may benefit an individual company, the paper tries to provide some persuasive empirical and theoretical evidence to support this proposition.

We contribute to the literature by showing that in contexts of contradictory information integration, current theory regarding the consequences of dialectical thinking needs to be extended to include not only an attenuation of the extremity effect prior research has found, but a complete reversal.
