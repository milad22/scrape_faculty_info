Our findings coincided with the results of Kay's group in the following points: (1) the PANSS scores were normally distributed; (2) the positive and negative scales showed good interrater reliability; (3) positive and negative syndromes are independent constructs; (4) the positive and negative scales held a high concurrent validity in relation to the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms; and (5) although positive and negative syndromes showed factorial validity, they were not sufficient to account for the whole of the schizophrenic symptoms. Unlike Kay's group, we found a modest internal consistency of the positive scale, indicating that it is composed of several independent components. The data suggest \u2026",

A factor analysis from the nine subscales and two symptoms (inappropriate affect and poverty of content) and a review of the previous factor analyses suggest that schizophrenic symptoms cannot be appropriately classified into positive and negative syndromes. The low internal consistency of the SAPS suggests that the positive symptoms are not a homogeneous syndrome. Our results fit better with Liddle's model of three syndromes (negative, delusion-hallucination and disorganisation syndromes).

            "During the last two decades, much effort has been made to precisely characterize the symptom dimensions of schizophrenia. A number of dimensional models have been proposed, the most popular of which has been a three-dimensional model consisting of psychotic, negative and disorganizational symptoms. This model, however, has been criticized as too simplistic, and more complex models have been proposed, although to date there has been no consensus as to the number and nature of dimensions necessary to account for the whole range of schizophrenic symptoms. In the present paper, the authors review the main methodological issues which have led to the current confusion about the number of dimensions underlying schizophrenic psychopathology. Among the main issues influencing the delimitation of dimensions are: statistical procedures for determining the number of factors, phase of the illness \u2026",

There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the SAPS; the group of cannabis abusers had higher scores except for the delusions subscale.
