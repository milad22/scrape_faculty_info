            "We continue our study of heterotic compactifications on non-K\u00e4hler complex manifolds with torsion. We give further evidence of the consistency of the six-dimensional manifold presented earlier and discuss the anomaly cancellation and possible supergravity description for a generic non-K\u00e4hler complex manifold using the newly proposed superpotential. The manifolds studied in our earlier papers had zero Euler characteristics. We construct new examples of non-K\u00e4hler complex manifolds with torsion in lower dimensions, that have nonzero Euler characteristics. Some of these examples are constructed from consistent backgrounds in F-theory and therefore are solutions to the string equations of motion. We discuss consistency conditions for compactifications of the heterotic string on smooth non-K\u00e4hler manifolds and illustrate how some results well known for Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications, including counting the \u2026",

Our proposal is in the same spirit as recent discussions of K-theory and D-branes; within the restricted class mentioned, Grothendieck groups encode a choice of connection on each D-brane world-volume, in addition to information about the C\u221e bundles. We also point out that derived categories can also be used to give insight into D-brane constructions, and analyze how a Z 2 subset of the T-duality group acting on D-branes on tori can be understood in terms of a Fourier\u2013Mukai transformation.",

            "In this paper we explicitly work out the precise relationship between Ext groups and massless modes of D-branes wrapped on complex submanifolds of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Specifically, we explicitly compute the boundary vertex operators for massless Ramond sector states, in open string B models describing Calabi-Yau manifolds at large radius, directly in BCFT using standard methods. Naively these vertex operators are in one-to-one correspondence with certain sheaf cohomology groups (as is typical for such vertex operator calculations), which are related to the desired Ext groups via spectral sequences. However, a subtlety in the physics of the open string B model has the effect of physically realizing those spectral sequences in BRST cohomology, so that the vertex operators are actually in one-to-one correspondence with Ext group elements. This gives an extremely concrete physical test of recent proposals regarding the relationship between derived categories and D-branes. We check these results extensively in numerous examples, and comment on several related issues.",

Ordinary quantum chiral rings reflect worldsheet instanton corrections to correlation functions involving products of elements of Dolbeault cohomology groups on the target space. The heterotic generalization described here involves computing worldsheet instanton corrections to correlation functions defined by products of elements of sheaf cohomology groups. One must not only compactify moduli spaces of rational curves, but also extend a sheaf (determined by the gauge bundle) over the compactification, and linear sigma models provide natural mechanisms for doing both. Euler classes of obstruction bundles generalize to this language in an interesting way.",
