            "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a major cause of neurological disease following the near eradication of poliovirus. Accumulating evidence suggests that mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs of 18 to 23 nucleotides (nt) with important regulatory roles in many cellular processes, participate in host antiviral defenses. However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 infection and pathogenesis are still unclear. Here, hsa-miR-296-5p expression was significantly increased in EV71-infected human cells. As determined by virus titration, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting, overexpression of hsa-miR-296-5p inhibited, while inhibition of endogenous hsa-miR-296-5p facilitated, EV71 infection. Additionally, two potential hsa-miR-296-5p targets (nt 2115 to 2135 and nt 2896 to 2920) located in the EV71 genome (strain BrCr) were bioinformatically predicted and validated by \u2026",

            "Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a single, positive-stranded RNA virus, has been regarded as the most important neurotropic enterovirus after the eradication of the poliovirus. EV71 infection can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina. Cytokine storm with elevated levels of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, has been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of EV71-induced disease. TNF-\u03b1\u2013mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays a key role in inflammatory response. We hypothesized that EV71 might also moderate host inflammation by interfering with this pathway. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and identified EV71 2C protein as an antagonist of TNF-\u03b1\u2013mediated activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Expression of 2C protein significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1\u2013mediated NF-\u03baB activation in 293T cells as measured by gene reporter and gel mobility shift assays. Furthermore \u2026",

Although many infected children suffer from respiratory or gastroenteric tract diseases, an association between HBoV and these diseases is not definite. Because modulation of type I IFN is crucial for viruses to establish efficient replication, in this study, we tested whether HBoV modulates type I IFN production. We observed that a nearly full-length HBoV clone significantly reduced both Sendai virus (SeV)- and poly(deoxyadenylic-thymidylic) acid-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Further study showed that NP1 blocked IFN-\u03b2 activation in response to SeV, poly(deoxyadenylic-thymidylic) acid, and IFN-\u03b2 pathway inducers, including retinoic acid-inducible protein I, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, inhibitor of \u03baB kinase \u03b5, and TANK-binding kinase 1.

As one of the structural components of viruses, viral envelope lipids are hard to be labeled with QDs due to the lack of efficient methods to modify viral envelope lipids. Moreover, it is still a challenge to maintain the intactness and infectivity of labeled viruses. Herein, a mild method has been developed to label viral envelope lipids with QDs by harnessing the biotinylated lipid-self-inserted cellular membrane. Biotinylated lipids can spontaneously insert in cellular membranes of host cells during culture and then be naturally assembled on progeny Pseudorabies virus (PrV) via propagation.
