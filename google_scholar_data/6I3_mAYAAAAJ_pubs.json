            "We briefly review our implementation of the real-space Green's function (RSGF) approach for calculations of X-ray spectra, focusing on recently developed parameter free models for dominant many-body effects. Although the RSGF approach has been widely used both for near edge (XANES) and extended (EXAFS) ranges, previous implementations relied on semi-phenomenological methods, e.g., the plasmon-pole model for the self-energy, the final-state rule for screened core hole effects, and the correlated Debye model for vibrational damping. Here we describe how these approximations can be replaced by efficient ab initio models including a many-pole model of the self-energy, inelastic losses and multiple-electron excitations; a linear response approach for the core hole; and a Lanczos approach for Debye\u2013Waller effects. We also discuss the implementation of these models and software improvements within \u2026",

            "There has been dramatic progress in recent years both in the calculation and interpretation of various x-ray spectroscopies. However, current theoretical calculations often use a number of simplified models to account for many-body effects, in lieu of first principles calculations. In an effort to overcome these limitations we describe in this article a number of recent advances in theory and in theoretical codes which offer the prospect of parameter free calculations that include the dominant many-body effects. These advances are based on ab initio calculations of the dielectric and vibrational response of a system. Calculations of the dielectric function over a broad spectrum yield system dependent self-energies and mean-free paths, as well as intrinsic losses due to multi-electron excitations. Calculations of the dynamical matrix yield vibrational damping in terms of multiple-scattering Debye\u2013Waller factors. Our ab initio \u2026",

This approach is based on an extension of an approach previously implemented for a linear response using the electronic structure program SIESTA. Instead of calculating excited quantum states, which can be a bottleneck in frequency-space calculations, the response of large molecular systems to time-varying electric fields is calculated in real time. This method is based on the finite field approach generalized to the dynamic case. To speed the nonlinear calculations, our approach uses Gaussian enveloped quasimonochromatic external fields. We thereby obtain the frequency-dependent second harmonic generation \u03b2(\u22122\u03c9;\u03c9,\u03c9), the dc nonlinear rectification \u03b2(0;\u2212\u03c9,\u03c9), and the electro-optic effect \u03b2(\u2212\u03c9;\u03c9,0).

We consider five generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) functionals (PBE, PBEsol, WC, AM05, and HTBS) as well as the local density approximation (LDA) functional. We investigate a wide variety of materials including a semiconductor (silicon), a metal (copper), and various insulators (SiO 2 \u03b1-quartz and stishovite, ZrSiO 4 zircon, and MgO periclase). For the structural properties, we find that PBEsol and WC are the closest to the experiments and AM05 performs only slightly worse. All three functionals actually improve over LDA and PBE in contrast with HTBS, which is shown to fail dramatically for \u03b1-quartz.

This behavior indicates that the n=5\u201311 clusters share a common structural motif.

            "An approach is presented for theoretical calculations of the Debye-Waller factors in x-ray absorption and related spectra. These damping factors are represented in terms of the cumulant expansion up to third order. They account respectively for the net thermal expansion \u03c3 (1)(T), the mean-square relative displacements \u03c3 2 (T), and the asymmetry of the pair distribution function \u03c3 (3)(T). Similarly, we obtain Debye-Waller factors for x-ray and neutron scattering in terms of the mean-square vibrational amplitudes u 2 (T). Our method is based on density functional theory calculations of the dynamical matrix, together with an efficient Lanczos algorithm for projected phonon spectra within the quasiharmonic approximation. Because of the anharmonicity in the interatomic forces, the results are highly sensitive to variations in the equilibrium lattice constants, and hence to the choice of exchange-correlation potential.
