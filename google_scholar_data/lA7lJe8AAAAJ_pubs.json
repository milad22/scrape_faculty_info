The suggestedapproach is based on the use of continued fraction expansions;in the case of negative coefficients in a continued fractionexpansion, the use of negative impedance converters is proposed.Several possible methods for obtaining suitable rational appromixationsand continued fraction expansions are discussed. An exampleof realization of a fractional-order I\u03bb controlleris presented and illustrated by obtained measurements.The suggested approach can be used for the control of veryfast processes, where the use of digital controllers isdifficult or impossible.",

The first method is concerned with gray-level intensity imaging, whereby the most commonly employed lighting techniques are surveyed. Subsequently, two range imaging techniques are introduced which may succeed in contrast to intensity imaging if the reflection property across the intact surface changes. However, range imaging for surface inspection is restricted to surface defects with three-dimensional characteristics, e.g. cavities. One range imaging approach is based on light sectioning in conjunction with fast imaging sensors. The second introduced range imaging technique is photometric stereo.",

In contrast to already existing intensity-based systems, the measurement of the luminescence lifetime provides certain advantages, such as insensitivity to photobleaching or leaching of the dye or changes in the intensity of excitation light. This facilitates the use of simple optical fibers. Phase measurement techniques have shown to be a powerful tool for indirect measurement of luminescence lifetimes. Here, dyes with luminescence decay times in the order of tens or hundreds of microseconds allow the use of simple opto-electronic circuitry and low-cost processing electronics. An optical oxygen sensor module has been developed with the dimensions of only 120 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 30 mm.

The new algorithm produces the unique discrete surface whose gradients are equal to the measured gradients in the global vertical-distance least-squares sense. We show that it has been erroneously believed that this problem has been solved before via the solution of a Poisson equation. The numerical behaviour of the algorithm allows for reliable surface reconstruction on exceedingly large scales, e.g., full digital images; moreover, the algorithm is direct, i.e., non-iterative. We demonstrate the algorithm with synthetic data as well as real data obtained via photometric stereo.

This novel method is numerically efficient and is suitable for fitting to dense datasets with low noise.

            "In this paper we present a new architecture for a smart sensor interface. It is based on an oversampled A\/D converter associated with a small ROM containing calibration coefficients. The nonlinear function desired is obtained by piecewise linear interpolation between the values stored in the ROM, without any additional circuits. This solution has the advantage of high programming flexibility, long-term stability, and low area consumption. Moreover, it is suitable for co-integration with sensors because of its minimum analog content. A prototype was integrated in a CMOS 1.2-\/spl mu\/m technology. Simulation and experimental results are reported together with a detailed theoretical analysis and some design guidelines.< >",

            "This paper presents several new algorithms for the regularized reconstruction of a surface from its measured gradient field. By taking a matrix-algebraic approach, we establish general framework for the regularized reconstruction problem based on the Sylvester Matrix Equation. Specifically, Spectral Regularization via Generalized Fourier Series (e.g., Discrete Cosine Functions, Gram Polynomials, Haar Functions, etc.), Tikhonov regularization, Constrained Regularization by imposing boundary conditions, and regularization via Weighted least squares can all be solved expediently in the context of the Sylvester Equation framework. State-of-the-art solutions to this problem are based on sparse matrix methods, which are no better than  algorithms for an  surface with . In contrast, the newly proposed methods are based on the global least squares cost function and are all  algorithms. In \u2026",
