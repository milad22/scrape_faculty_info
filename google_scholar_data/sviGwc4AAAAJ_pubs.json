Our approach is based on the rigid limit of new minimal supergravity in three dimensions, which couples to the flat-space supermultiplet containing the R-current and the energy-momentum tensor. The field theory on possesses a single supercharge if and only if admits an almost contact metric structure that satisfies a certain integrability condition. This may lead to global restrictions on, even though we can always construct one supercharge on any given patch. We also analyze the conditions for the presence of additional supercharges. In particular, two supercharges of opposite R-charge exist on every Seifert manifold. We present general supersymmetric Lagrangians on and discuss their flat-space limit, which can be analyzed using the R-current supermultiplet. As an \u2026",

A crucial role is played by certain local terms in these background fields, including several Chern-Simons terms. The presence of these terms clarifies a number of subtle properties of F. This understanding allows us to prove the F-maximization principle. It also explains why computing F via localization leads to a complex answer, even though we expect it to be real in unitary theories. We discuss several corollaries of our results and comment on the relation to the F-theorem.",

The algorithm is conjectural, but passes a vast web of consistency checks. We apply it to tabulate a large variety of superconformal multiplets. In particular, we classify and construct all multiplets that contain conserved currents or free fields, which play an important role in superconformal field theories (SCFTs). Some currents that are allowed in conformal field theories cannot be embedded in superconformal multiplets, and hence they are absent in SCFTs. We use the structure of superconformal stress tensor multiplets to show that SCFTs with more than 16 Poincar\u00e9 supercharges cannot arise in d\u2265 4, even when the corresponding superconformal algebras exist.
