            "This article discusses fluctuating order in a quantum disordered phase proximate to a quantum critical point, with particular emphasis on fluctuating stripe order. Optimal strategies are derived for extracting information concerning such local order from experiments, with emphasis on neutron scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy. These ideas are tested by application to two model systems\u2014an exactly solvable one-dimensional (1D) electron gas with an impurity, and a weakly interacting 2D electron gas. Experiments on the cuprate high-temperature superconductors which can be analyzed using these strategies are extensively reviewed. The authors adduce evidence that stripe correlations are widespread in the cuprates. They compare and contrast the advantages of two limiting perspectives on the high-temperature superconductor: weak coupling, in which correlation effects are treated as a perturbation on \u2026",

This gap exists only in underdoped samples and closes around the doping level at which the superconducting transition temperature Tc is a maximum. The momentum dependence and magnitude of the gap closely resemble those of the dx2\u2212y2 gap observed in the superconducting state. This observation is consistent with results from several other experimental techniques, which also indicate the presence of a gap in the normal state. Some possible theoretical explanations for this effect are reviewed.",

            "A zero-temperature magnetic-field-tuned superconducting-insulating transition is observed in two-dimensional a-MoGe films. The low temperature transport properties of these films show scaling behavior consistent with a transition driven by long-range Coulomb interactions and quantum phase fluctuations in a two-dimensional superconductor. However, contrary to the theoretical predictions we find the critical resistance to be sample dependent. We suggest that the apparent lack of universality in the critical resistance is due to the finite contribution of fermionic excitations to the resistance.",

The total specific heat is best described by including two predictions for the electronic specific heat of d-wave superconductivity: a T 2 term in zero field and an increased linear term in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Cu O 2 planes. The additional linear term, which implies a finite N (E F, H), obeys N (E F, H)\u221d(H H c 2) 1 2 as predicted by Volovik for superconductivity with lines of nodes in the gap.",
