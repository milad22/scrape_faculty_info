We present measurements of the thickness-dependent evolution of the magnetic properties of the Fe films as determined by in situ magneto-optic Kerr effect. We find that the magnetic properties and growth mode are similar for both 2\u00d7 4 and c (4\u00d7 4) reconstructions, although the initial adsorption sites and island nucleation as measured by scanning tunneling microscopy are clearly dominated by the substrate surface reconstruction. The onset of room-temperature ferromagnetism occurs at 6 ML for growth on both GaAs surface reconstructions. At this coverage, the measured Curie temperature (\u223c 100 C) is significantly reduced from that of bulk \u03b1-Fe (770 C). The \u2026",

The modification of the spin-injection process by a nanoscale step edge was observed. On flat gallium arsenide [GaAs(110)] terraces, the injection efficiency was 92%, whereas in a 10-nanometer-wide region around a [1\u030411]-oriented step the injection efficiency is reduced by a factor of 6. Alternatively, the spin-relaxation lifetime was reduced by a factor of 12. This reduction is associated with the metallic nature of the step edge.

            "The migration of individual Ga atoms on the technologically important GaAs(001)-(2\u00d74) reconstructed surface has been studied as a function of substrate temperature and As4 pressure using a combined molecular beam epitaxy and scanning tunneling microscope ultrahigh vacuum multichamber facility. We have deposited 10% of a plane of Ga onto a GaAs(001) surface with a low defect density (<1% ) and with large terraces (>0.5 \u03bcm) to avoid the influence of surface defects like step edges and vacancies. Both the island number density and the geometry are measured and compared to Monte Carlo solid-on-solid simulations. Basic diffusion parameters, such as the activation energy, directional hopping-rate ratio, directional sticking-probability ratio, etc., are reported.",
