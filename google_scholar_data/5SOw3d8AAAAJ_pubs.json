The project was focused on two primary elements: 1) the comparison, stability, and validity of industry models and 2) a comprehensive analysis of process stacks to evaluate the ultimate sensitivity and limits of OCD. Modeling methods are a requirement for the interpretation and quantitative analysis of scatterometry data. The four models evaluated show good agreement over a range of targets and geometries for zero order specular reflection as well as higher order diffraction. A number of process stacks and geometries representing semiconductor manufacturing nodes from the 45 nm node to the 18 nm node were simulated using several measurement modalities including angle-resolved scatterometry and spectrally-resolved scatterometry, measuring various \u2026",

Previously we reported results from samples with sub-50-nm-sized features having pitches larger than the conventional Rayleigh resolution criterion, which resulted in images having edge contrast and elements of conventional imaging. In this paper we extend these methods to targets composed of features much denser than the conventional Rayleigh resolution criterion. For these applications, a new approach is presented that uses a combination of zero-order optical response and edge-based imaging. The approach is, however, more general and a more comprehensive set of analyses using theoretical methods is presented. This analysis gives a direct measure of the ultimate size \u2026",

The method includes the propagation of the measurement noise as well as estimates of systematic effects in the measurement. Since there may be correlations between the various parameters determined by the measurement, a method is described for visualizing the uncertainty in the extracted profile. The analysis is performed for a 120 nm pitch grating, consisting of photoresist lines 120 nm high, 45 nm critical dimension, and 88\u00b0 side wall angle, measured with a spectroscopic rotating compensator ellipsometer. The results suggest that, while scatterometry is very precise, there are a number of sources of systematic errors that limit its absolute accuracy. Addressing those systematic errors may significantly improve \u2026",

An optimized capacitance sensitivity of 1.6 aF\/Hz is achieved at a maximum source-drain bias of 170\u2212 \u03bc V root-mean-square and with a bandwidth of 18 MHz. Coulomb blockade in a quantum-dot is measured in both conductance and capacitance, and the two contributions are found to be proportional as expected from a quasistatic tunneling model.

            "This paper compares and contrasts different combinations of scatterfield and scatterometry optical configurations as well as introduces a new approach to embedding atomic force microscopy (AFM) or other reference metrology results directly in the uncertainty analysis and library-fitting process to reduce parametric uncertainties. We present both simulation results and experimental data demonstrating this new method, which is based on the application of a Bayesian analysis to library-based regression fitting of optical critical dimension (OCD) data. We develop the statistical methods to implement this approach of nested uncertainty analysis and give several examples, which demonstrate reduced uncertainties in the final combined measurements. The approach is also demonstrated through a combined reference metrology application using several independent measurement methods.",
