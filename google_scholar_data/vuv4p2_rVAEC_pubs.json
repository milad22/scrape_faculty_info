            "We have observed Bose-Einstein condensation of molecules. When a spin mixture of fermionic L i 6 atoms was evaporatively cooled in an optical dipole trap near a Feshbach resonance, the atomic gas was converted into L i 2 6 molecules. Below 600 nK, a Bose-Einstein condensate of up to 900 000 molecules was identified by the sudden onset of a bimodal density distribution. This condensate realizes the limit of tightly bound fermion pairs in the crossover between BCS superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation.",

Prerequisite to this goal is the observation of measurement backaction consistent with quantum metrology limits. However, thermal noise currently dominates measurements and precludes ground-state preparation of the resonator. Here, we establish the collective motion of an ultracold atomic gas confined tightly within a Fabry\u2013Perot optical cavity as a system for investigating the quantum mechanics of macroscopic bodies. The cavity-mode structure selects a particular collective vibrational motion that is measured by the cavity\u2019s optical properties, actuated by the cavity optical field and subject to backaction by the quantum force fluctuations of this field. Experimentally, we quantify such fluctuations by measuring the cavity-light-induced heating of the intracavity atomic ensemble. These \u2026",
