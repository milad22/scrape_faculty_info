Zeolite membranes are thus well suited for separating liquid-phase mixtures by pervaporation, and the first commercial application of zeolite membranes has been for dehydrating organic compounds. Because of the large number of zeolites that can be prepared, zeolite membranes have also been used to remove organic compounds from water, separate organic mixtures, and remove water from acid solutions on the laboratory scale. The fundamental aspects of separations by pervaporation through zeolite membranes are reviewed, and examples of the selectivities and fluxes obtained are presented. Some aspects of these separations are similar to gas-phase separations using zeolite membranes, but feed-side coverages are close to saturation during \u2026",

            "In a typical temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment on a supported metal catalyst, a small amount of catalyst (10\u2013200 mg) is contained in a reactor that can be heated by a furnace. An inert gas, usually helium at atmospheric pressure, flows over the catalyst. Following pretreatment to obtain a reduced catalyst, a gas is adsorbed on the surface, usually by pulse injections of the adsorbate into the carrier gas upstream from the reactor. After the excess gas is flushed out, the catalyst is heated to create a linear rise in temperature with time. A small thermocouple inserted in the catalyst measures the temperature and a detector downstream measures the change in the inert gas stream. The ideal detector is a mass spectrometer which measures the composition of the effluent stream as a function of catalyst temperature. Because of the high carrier-gas flow rate, the detector response is proportional to \u2026",

The CO2 and CH4 heats of adsorption were measured on SAPO-34 crystals as 24 \u00b1 0.8 and 16 \u00b1 0.8 kJ\/mol, respectively. Selectivity depended on temperature, feed pressure, and pressure drop. A maximum in CO2 permeance was observed near 275 K for both the single gas and a CO2\/CH4 mixture. The CO2\/CH4 selectivity decreased as temperature increased from 253 to 473 K.

The activation energies were determined by two methods; one method employed a relationship for the shift in peak temperature with change in heating rate, and the other utilized the change in peak amplitude with shift in peak temperature for different heating rates. Agreement between the two methods was excellent. A series of flash curves at different heating rates were obtained for the CO2 and CO products from DCOOH flash decomposition following adsorption on Ni (110) at 37\u00b0C. Adsorbed DCOOH decomposed autocatalytically with an activation energy of 26.6 kcal\/mol to form CO2 and D2. Carbon monoxide formation from DCOOH decomposition, which corresponded identically to CO desorption from this surface, showed a first \u2026",

Single\u2010gas permeances for H2, CH4, N2, CO2, n\u2010butane, and i\u2010butane increase over some temperature range, but some gases exhibit maxima or minima. The highest ideal selectivities at room temperature are 299 for N2\/SF6, 392 for H2\/n\u2010butane, and 2,820 for H2\/i\u2010butane. These membranes can separate n\u2010butane\/i\u2010butane, H2\/n\u2010butane and H2\/i\u2010butane mixtures. All n\u2010butane\/i\u2010butane separation selectivities have maxima as a function of temperature and are higher than ideal selectivities because n\u2010butane inhibits i\u2010butane permeation. Thus, separation is not by size selectivity, but is due to pore blocking. Temperature depenencies of single\u2010gas permeances and separation selectivities depend strongly on \u2026",
