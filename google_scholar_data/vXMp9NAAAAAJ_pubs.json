We discuss the``causal patch''description of spacetime required by this framework, and present some simple examples of cosmologies described this way. We argue that these assumptions inevitably lead to very deep paradoxes, which seem to require major revisions of our usual assumptions.",

In dimension d> 3, where the curvature grows large near the singularity, we find distinct but subtle signals of this singularity in the boundary CFT correlators. Building on previous work, we study correlation functions of operators on the two disjoint asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime by investigating the spacelike geodesics that join the boundaries. These dominate the correlators for large mass bulk fields. We show that the Penrose diagram for d> 3 is not square. As a result, the real geodesic connecting the two boundary points becomes almost null and bounces off the singularity at a finite boundary time t c\u2260 0. If this geodesic were to dominate the correlator there would be a``light cone\" singularity at t c. However, general properties of the boundary theory rule this out.

This would imply that we live in an open FRW universe with negative spatial curvature. We argue that the``overshoot\" problem, which in other settings would make it difficult to achieve slow roll inflation, actually favors such a cosmology. We consider anthropic bounds on the value of the curvature and on the parameters of inflation. When supplemented by statistical arguments these bounds suggest that the number of inflationary efolds is not very much larger than the observed lower bound. Although not statistically favored, the likelihood that the number of efolds is close to the bound set by observations is not negligible. The possible signatures of such a low number \u2026",

Thus we must either give up the finiteness of de Sitter space entropy or the exact symmetry of the classical space. Each has interesting implications for the very long time behavior.

If the initial scalar field variations are contained within a sufficiently flat region of the inflaton potential, and the universe is spatially flat or open on average, inflation will occur following the dilution of the gradient and kinetic energy due to expansion. This is the case even when the scale of the inhomogeneities is comparable to the initial Hubble length, and overdense regions collapse and form black holes, because underdense regions continue expanding, allowing inflation to eventually begin.

            "Inflation creates large-scale cosmological density perturbations that are characterized by an isotropic, homogeneous, and Gaussian random distribution about a locally flat background. Even in a flat universe, the spatial curvature measured within one Hubble volume receives contributions from long wavelength perturbations, and will not in general be zero. These same perturbations determine the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations, which are Script O (10\u2212 5). Consequently, the low-l multipole moments in the CMB temperature map predict the value of the measured spatial curvature \u03a9 k. On this basis we argue that a measurement of| \u03a9 k|> 10\u2212 4 would rule out slow-roll eternal inflation in our past with high confidence, while a measurement of \u03a9 k<\u2212 10\u2212 4 (which is positive curvature, a locally closed universe) rules out false-vacuum eternal inflation as well, at the same confidence level.
