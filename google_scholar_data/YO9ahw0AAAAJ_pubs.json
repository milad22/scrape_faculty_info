We start with a classical solution describing string rotating in AdS 5 and boosted along large circle of S 5. The energy of the classical solution E is a function of the spin S and the momentum J (R-charge) which interpolates between the limiting cases S= 0 and J= 0 considered previously. We derive the corresponding quadratic fluctuation action for bosonic and fermionic fields from the GS string action and compute the string 1-loop (large\u221a \u03bb= R 2\/\u03b1') correction to the classical energy spectrum in the (S, J) sector. We find that the 1-loop correction to the ground-state energy does not cancel for S\u2260 0. For large S it scales as ln S, ie as the classical term, with no higher powers of ln S appearing. This supports the conjecture made in hep-th\/0204051 that the classical E\u2212 S= aln S scaling \u2026",

The ansatz differs from the recently proposed all-loop gauge theory asymptotic Bethe ansatz by additional factorized scattering terms for the local excitations. We also show that our ansatz quantitatively reproduces everything that is currently known about the string spectrum of these states. Firstly, by construction, we recover the integral Bethe equations describing semiclassical spinning strings. Secondly, we explain how to derive the 1\/J energy corrections of M-impurity BMN states, provide explicit, general formulae for both distinct and confluent mode numbers, and compare to asymptotic gauge theory. In the special cases M= 2, 3 we reproduce the results of direct quantization of Callan et al. Lastly, at \u2026",

We find a novel solution describing a circular closed string located at a fixed value of AdS 5 radius while rotating simultaneously in two planes in AdS 5 with equal spins S. This solution is a direct generalization of a two-spin flat-space solution where the string rotates in two orthogonal planes while always lying on a 3-sphere. Similar solution exists for a string rotating in S 5: it is parametrized by the angular momentum J of the center of mass and two equal SO (6) angular momenta J 2= J 3= J\u2032 in the two rotation planes. The remarkably simple case is of J= 0 where the energy depends on J\u2032 as E=(2J\u2032) 2+ \u03bb (\u03bb is the string tension or't Hooft coupling).

            "As was recently found in [3], there exists a simple classical solution describing a closed string rotating in S 5 and located at the center of AdS 5. It is parametrized by the angular momentum J of the center of mass and two equal SO (6) angular momenta J'in the two other orthogonal rotation planes. The corresponding dual N= 4 SYM operators should be scalar operators in SU (4) representations [0, J\u2212 J', 2J'] if J\u2265 J', or [J'\u2212 J, 0, J'+ J] if J'\u2265 J. This solution is stable if J'\u2264(3\/2) J and for large J+ 2J'its classical energy admits an expansion in positive powers of {\u03bb\/(J+ 2J') 2}(\u03bb 1\/2 is proportional to string tension): E= J+ 2J'+{\u03bb\/(J+ 2J') 2} J'+\u22ef. This suggests a possibility of a direct comparison with perturbative SYM results for the corresponding anomalous dimensions in the sector with {\u03bb\/(J+ 2J') 2}<< 1, by analogy with the BMN case. We conjecture that all quantum sigma model string corrections are then subleading at large J' \u2026",
