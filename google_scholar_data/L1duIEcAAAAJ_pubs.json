            "A central question in the field of graphene-related research is how graphene behaves when it is patterned at the nanometre scale with different edge geometries. A fundamental shape relevant to this question is the graphene nanoribbon (GNR), a narrow strip of graphene that can have different chirality depending on the angle at which it is cut. Such GNRs have been predicted to exhibit a wide range of behaviour, including tunable energy gaps 1, 2 and the presence of one-dimensional (1D) edge states 3, 4, 5 with unusual magnetic structure 6, 7. Most GNRs measured up to now have been characterized by means of their electrical conductivity, leaving the relationship between electronic structure and local atomic geometry unclear 8, 9, 10. Here we present a sub-nanometre-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) study of GNRs that allows us to examine how GNR electronic \u2026",

Here we report the ability to engineer the microscopic edge termination of high-quality GNRs via hydrogen plasma etching. Using a combination of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we have determined the exact atomic structure of plasma-etched GNR edges and established the chemical nature of terminating functional groups for zigzag, armchair, and chiral edge orientations. We find that the edges of hydrogen-plasma-etched GNRs are generally flat, free of structural reconstructions, and terminated by hydrogen atoms with no rehybridization of the outermost carbon edge atoms. Both zigzag and chiral edges show the presence of edge states.",

The coverage-dependent phase diagram for ACA is first determined from room-temperature STM imaging. At low molecular coverages (\u03b8 < 0.4 ML, ML = monolayer), ACA forms a 2-D gas phase. Ordered ACA structures appear with increasing coverage:\u2009 first a chain structure composed of ACA molecules linked by consecutive O\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds (\u03b8 > 0.4 ML), then a dimer structure composed of ACA dimers linked by paired carboxyl-carboxyl hydrogen bonds (\u03b8 \u2248 1.0 ML). Structures of the C60:ACA binary system depend on the coverage of predeposited ACA. At intermediate (0.4 ML \u223c 0.8 ML) ACA coverages, C60 deposition results in a hexagonal cooperative structure with the C60 periodicity nearly 3 times that of the normal C \u2026",

Using in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, we examined the effects of thermally excited defects on the current-biased displacement of monatomic islands of radius 2 to 50 nanometers on single-crystal Ag(111). The islands move opposite to the current direction, with velocity varying inversely with radius. The force is thus in the same direction as electron flow and acts on atomic defect sites at the island edge. The unexpectedly large force on the boundary atoms can be decreased by over a factor of 10 by adding a mildly electron-withdrawing adsorbate, C60, which also modifies the step geometry. The low coordination of the identified scattering sites is the likely origin of the large force.",
