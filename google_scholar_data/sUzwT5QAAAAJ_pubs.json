            "The extinct p-process nuclide 146Sm serves as an astrophysical and geochemical chronometer through measurements of isotopic anomalies of its \u03b1-decay daughter 142Nd. Based on analyses of 146Sm\/147Sm \u03b1-activity and atom ratios, we determined the half-life of 146Sm to be 68 \u00b1 7 (1\u03c3) million years, which is shorter than the currently used value of 103 \u00b1 5 million years. This half-life value implies a higher initial 146Sm abundance in the early solar system, (146Sm\/144Sm)0 = 0.0094 \u00b1 0.0005 (2\u03c3), than previously estimated. Terrestrial, lunar, and martian planetary silicate mantle differentiation events dated with 146Sm-142Nd converge to a shorter time span and in general to earlier times, due to the combined effect of the new 146Sm half-life and (146Sm\/144Sm)0 values.",

The decay products were detected in the HiRA array and the level energies were identified from their invariant mass. Correlations between the decay products were examined to deduce the nature of the decays, specifically to what extent all the fragments were created in one prompt step or whether the disintegration proceeded in a sequential fashion through long-lived intermediate states. In the latter case, information on the spin of the level was also obtained. Of particular interest is the five-body decay of the C 8 ground state, which was found to disintegrate in two steps of two-proton decay passing through the Be 6 g. s. intermediate state. The isobaric analog of C 8 g. s. in B 8 was also found to undergo two-proton decay to the isobaric analog of \u2026",

Precise three-body correlations extracted from the experimental data allowed us to obtain insight into the mechanism of the three-body democratic decay. The correlation data are in good agreement with a three-cluster-model calculation and thus validate this theoretical approach over a broad energy range.",
