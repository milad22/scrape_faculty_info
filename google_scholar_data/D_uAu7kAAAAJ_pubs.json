            "This review presents recent developments in the understanding of how impurities influence the electronic states in the bulk properties of superconductors. The focus is on quasilocalized states in the vicinity of impurity sites in conventional and unconventional superconductors and the goal is to provide a unified framework for their description. The nonmagnetic impurity resonances in unconventional superconductors are directly related to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states around magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave systems. The physics behind these states, including the quantum phase transition between screened and unscreened impurities, are reviewed and recent work on d-wave superconductors is emphasized. The bound states are seen in scanning-tunneling spectroscopy measurements on high-T c cuprates, which are described in detail. This paper discusses very recent progress in our understanding of \u2026",

At 5 T the data show a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior down to the lowest temperatures. At the field above 8 T the data exhibit a crossover from the Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid behavior. We analyzed the scaling properties of the specific heat and compared both the resistivity and the specific heat with the predictions of a spin-fluctuation theory. Our analysis leads us to suggest that the NFL behavior is due to incipient antiferromagnetism (AFM) in C e C o I n 5 with the quantum critical point in the vicinity of H c 2. Below H c 2 the AFM phase which competes with the paramagnetic ground state is superseded by the superconducting transition.",

            "Over the past two decades, unconventional superconductivity with gap symmetry other than s wave has been found in several classes of materials, including heavy fermion, high T c, and organic superconductors. Unconventional superconductivity is characterized by anisotropic superconducting gap functions, which may have zeros (nodes) along certain directions in the Brillouin zone. The nodal structure is closely related to the pairing interaction, and it is widely believed that the presence of nodes is a signature of magnetic or some other exotic, rather than conventional phonon mediated, pairing mechanism. Therefore experimental determination of the gap function is of fundamental importance. However, the detailed gap structure, especially the direction of the nodes, is an unresolved issue for most unconventional superconductors. Recently it has been demonstrated that thermal conductivity and specific heat \u2026",
