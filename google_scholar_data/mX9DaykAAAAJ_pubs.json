            "Fusion power has been increased by a factor of 3 in DIII-D by tailoring the pressure profile to avoid the kink instability in H-mode plasmas. The resulting plasmas are found to have neoclassical ion confinement. This reduction in transport losses in beam-heated plasmas with negative central shear is correlated with a dramatic reduction in density fluctuations. Improved magnetohydrodynamic stability is achieved by controlling the plasma pressure profile width. In deuterium plasmas the highest gain Q (the ratio of fusion power to input power), was 0.0015, corresponding to an equivalent Q of 0.32 in a deuterium-tritium plasma.",

In NCS discharges, a core transport barrier is often observed to form inside the NCS region accompanied by a reduction in core fluctuation amplitudes. Increasing negative magnetic shear contributes to the formation of this core transport barrier, but by itself is not sufficient to fully stabilize the toroidal drift mode (trapped\u2010electron\u2010\u03b7i mode) to explain this formation. Comparison of the Doppler shift shear rate to the growth rate of the \u03b7i mode suggests that the large core E\u00d7B flow shear can stabilize this mode and \u2026",

The relative gyroradius scalings of the electron and ion thermal diffusivities were determined separately using a two\u2010fluid transport analysis. For L\u2010mode plasmas, the electron diffusivity scaled as \u03c7e\u221d\u03c7B\u03c11.1\u00b10.3* (gyro\u2010Bohm\u2010like) while the ion diffusivity scaled as \u03c7i\u221d\u03c7B\u03c1\u22120.5\u00b10.3* (worse than Bohm\u2010like). The results were independent of the method of auxiliary heating (radio frequency or neutral beam). Since the electron and ion fluids had different gyroradius scalings, the effective diffusivity and global confinement time scalings were found to vary from gyro\u2010Bohm\u2010like to Bohm\u2010like depending upon whether the electron or ion channel dominated the heat flux.

Direct numerical simulation of fast test particles in a given field of electrostatic turbulence indicates that for reasonable parameters fast and thermal particle diffusion can indeed be similar. High quality plasma edge density profiles on ASDEX Upgrade and the recent extension of the reflectometry system allow for a direct comparison of observed TAE eigenfunctions with theoretical ones as obtained with the linear, gyrokinetic, global stability code LIGKA.

            "Reduction of core-resonant m=1 magnetic fluctuations and improved confinement in the Madison Symmetric Torus [Dexter et al., Fusion Technol. 19, 131 (1991)] reversed-field pinch have been routinely achieved through control of the surface poloidal electric field, but it is now known that the achieved confinement has been limited in part by edge-resonant m=0 magnetic fluctuations. Now, through refined poloidal electric field control, plus control of the toroidal electric field, it is possible to reduce simultaneously the m=0 and m=1 fluctuations. This has allowed confinement of high-energy runaway electrons, possibly indicative of flux-surface restoration in the usually stochastic plasma core. The electron temperature profile steepens in the outer region of the plasma, and the central electron temperature increases substantially, reaching nearly 1.3 keV at high toroidal plasma current (500 kA). At low current (200 kA), the \u2026",

The wave directionality required for driving current can be obtained by launching the waves above or below the midplane of the torus and is a geometric effect related to the poloidal magnetic field. Wave absorption is strong, a result of the electrostatic nature of the waves, giving efficient suprathermal tail formation and current drive.",
