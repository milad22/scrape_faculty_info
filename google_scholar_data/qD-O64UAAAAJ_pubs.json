            "We have measured the temperature dependence of the first-order Raman scattering by phonons in Si, Ge, and \u03b1\u2212 S n. The full widths at half maximum of the Raman lines, extrapolated to zero temperature, are 1.24\u00b10.07, 0.75\u00b10.03, and 0.81\u00b10.15 cm\u2212 1 for Si, Ge, and \u03b1\u2212 S n, respectively. The reliability of the data obtained allows a critical examination of the theoretical calculations published so far. We show that the model assuming the decay of the Raman phonon into two acoustical phonons belonging to the same branch, first proposed by Klemens, does not represent adequately the temperature dependence of the Raman linewidth. The most important decay channels are shown to be combinations of optical and acoustical phonons. However, the more complete calculation by Cowley, which involves all possible decay channels, gives very large zero-temperature linewidths. We show that this arises mainly from \u2026",

            "Direct-gap photoluminescence has been observed at room temperature in Ge1\u2212ySny alloys grown on (001) Si substrates. The emission wavelength is tunable over a 90 meV (200 nm) range by increasing the Sn concentration from y=0 to y=0.03. A weaker feature at lower energy is assigned to the indirect gap transitions, and the separation between the direct and indirect emission peaks is found to decrease as a function of y, as expected for these alloys. These results suggest that Ge1\u2212ySny alloys represent an attractive alternative to Ge for the fabrication of laser devices on Si.",
