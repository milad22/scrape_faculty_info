            "Chaotic pulsing and the route to chaos in a semiconductor laser with delayed, positive opto-electronic feedback are investigated numerically and experimentally. Both numerical simulation and experimental observation indicate that the laser enters a chaotic pulsing state at certain delay times of the feedback loop through a quasi-periodic route. The characteristics of each dynamical state are analyzed. The chaotic pulsing state is verified with a positive Lyapunov exponent and a fractal correlation dimension. The experimental results show very good qualitative agreement with the numerical results. Quantitative discrepancy between experimental and numerical results can be explained by the bandpass characteristics of the electronic feedback loop.",

Recent experimental results on broadband, high-frequency, phase-locked chaos synchronization, and message encoding-decoding at 2.5 Gb\/s are presented. System performance at a bit rate of 10 Gb\/s is numerically studied for the application of three encryption schemes, namely chaos shift keying, chaos masking, and additive chaos modulation, to three chaotic semiconductor laser systems, namely the optical injection system, the optical feedback system, and the optoelectronic feedback system. By causing synchronization error in the forms of synchronization deviation and desynchronization bursts, the channel noise and the laser noise both have significant effects on the system performance at high bit rates. Among the three laser systems, the optoelectronic feedback system has the \u2026",

We discuss the characteristics and the synchronization of two semiconductor lasers with optoelectronic feedback. The systems exhibit broadband chaotic intensity oscillations whose dynamical dimension generally increases with the time delay in the feedback loop. We explore the robustness of this synchronization with parameter mismatch in the lasers, with mismatch in the optoelectronic feedback delay, and with the strength of the coupling between the systems. Synchronization is robust to mismatches between the intrinsic parameters of the lasers, but it is sensitive to mismatches of the time delay in the transmitter and receiver feedback loops. An open-loop receiver configuration is suggested, eliminating feedback delay mismatch issues. Communication strategies for arbitrary amplitude of modulation onto the \u2026",

The maximum number of resolvable focal spots of the MEMS scanner is 720\u00d7720 on the x and y axes, which indicates that the MEMS scanner can potentially support high-resolution multiphoton imaging. The DCPCF is compared with standard single-mode fiber and hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber on the basis of dispersion, attenuation, and coupling efficiency properties. The DCPCF has high collection efficiency, and its dispersion can be compensated by grating pairs.

Both TPEF and SHG increased proportionally to the inverse of the pulse duration for the entire tested range. Because of improved signal-to-noise ratio, sub-20-fs pulses were used to enhance MPM imaging depth by approximately 160%, compared to 120-fs pulses, in human skin.",
