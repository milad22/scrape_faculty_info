            "Neutrophils from 8 Holstein heifers were evaluated for function during the periparturient period. Random migration, ingestion of bacteria, superoxide anion production, native (nonenhanced) chemiluminescence, iodination, and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity by neutrophils were determined. Foremilk samples were evaluated for bacteria. Significant (P< 0.05) increases in random migration of neutrophils, iodination, and chemiluminescence were evident 2 weeks before parturition and then decreased dramatically by the frrst week after parturition. These impairments of neutrophil function after parturition may be manifested as a severe cumulative deficit in the native defenses afforded by the neutrophil.",

The assay measures the exocytosis of myeloperoxidase (MPO) using 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate. The assay was validated by evaluating the effects of various stimulants and inhibitors of degranulation, the kinetics of primary granule exocytosis, and comparing the total myeloperoxidase content of neutrophils obtained from calves and adults. The results demonstrate that the assay is capable of detecting important differences that may occur in degranulation of bovine neutrophil primary granules and in total neutrophil myeloperoxidase content.",

This review summarizes the information available on in vitro and in vivo activation of neutrophils by recombinant cytokines. The emerging theme is that various cytokines (e.g., colony-stimulating factors, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, and interferons) have direct and often synergistic abilities that activate the neutrophil to have enhanced cytocidal activity towards microbial and cellular stimuli. Equally important (although less well studied), cytokines have been shown in some cases to enhance the function of neutrophils isolated from immunosuppressed animals. These neutrophils have depressed function, and influences of cytokines on these cells may be different from their \u2026",

The clinical observation of exacerbation of infectious diseases by glucocorticoids has led to the conception that glucocorticoids impair host defense \u2026",

            "Nipah virus (NiV), of the family Paramyxoviridae, was isolated in 1999 in Malaysia from a human fatality in an outbreak of severe human encephalitis, when human infections were linked to transmission of the virus from pigs. Consequently, a swine vaccine able to abolish virus shedding is of veterinary and human health interest. Canarypox virus-based vaccine vectors carrying the gene for NiV glycoprotein (ALVAC-G) or the fusion protein (ALVAC-F) were used to intramuscularly immunize four pigs per group, either with 108 PFU each or in combination. Pigs were boosted 14 days postvaccination and challenged with 2.5 \u00d7 105 PFU of NiV two weeks later. The combined ALVAC-F\/G vaccine induced the highest levels of neutralization antibodies (2,560); despite the low neutralizing antibody levels in the F vaccinees (160), all vaccinated animals appeared to be protected against challenge.

Pigs exposed to both PRRSV and S. suis were inoculated with PRRSV 7 days prior to S. suis inoculation. The pigs were 26 days old when inoculated with S. suis.
