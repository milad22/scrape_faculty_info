            "The topological insulating phase results from inversion of the band gap due to spin-orbit coupling at an odd number of time-reversal symmetric points. In Bi 2 Se 3, this inversion occurs at the \u0393 point. For bulk Bi 2 Se 3, we have analyzed the effect of arbitrary strain on the \u0393 point band gap using density functional theory. By computing the band structure both with and without spin-orbit interactions, we consider the effects of strain on the gap via Coulombic interaction and spin-orbit interaction separately. While compressive strain acts to decrease the Coulombic gap, it also increases the strength of the spin-orbit interaction, increasing the inverted gap. Comparison with Bi 2 Te 3 supports the conclusion that effects on both Coulombic and spin-orbit interactions are critical to understanding the behavior of topological insulators under strain, and we propose that the topological insulating phase can be effectively \u2026",

Chains of neutral oligomers are bent, whereas the negatively charged oligomers become almost planar due to accumulation of negative charge at the end monomers. Isomers of short oligomers (n < 6) display negative electron affinity although the corresponding anions are energetically stable. For longer oligomers with n \u2265 6, the electron affinity is small and positive, slowly increasing with oligopyrrole length. Doping of 12\u2010pyrrole with lithium atoms shows that negative oxidation states are possible due to electron transfer from dopant to oligomer at locations close to dopant. These 12\u2010pyrrole regions support extra negative charge and exhibit a local structural change from benzenoid to quinoid structure in the C\uf8ffC backbone conjugation.

We used this data to evaluate the differences between these two formalisms and quantify their accuracy, comparing to experimental data whenever applicable. At present, we have 17,805 OPT and 7,358 MBJ bandgaps and dielectric functions. MBJ is found to predict better bandgaps and dielectric functions than OPT, so it can be used to improve the well-known bandgap problem of DFT in a relatively inexpensive way.

To comprehensively describe the overall catalytic cycle of the hydrogenation of dioxygen using H2 catalyzed by the Ir complex 1, the potential energy surfaces for the hydrogenation process of both the catalyst 1 and the corresponding unsaturated iridium(III) amine cation ([1H]+) were explored at the same level of theory. The results of our computations, in agreement with experimental findings, confirm that the addition of H2 to the 16e diamido complexes 1 is favorable but is slow and is accelerated by the presence of Bro\u0308nsted acids, such as HOTf, which convert 1 into the corresponding amine cation [1H]+.

The spin texture arises due to a strong correlation between magnetocrystalline anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the vertical electric field, whose shape and size could be tuned with the magnetic field.

In this study, we explore the CDW transition through a combination of temperature and excitation-dependent Raman spectroscopy, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT). Below T CDW we identify two CDW amplitude modes that redshift and broaden with increasing temperature and one zone-folded mode that disappears above T CDW. Above T CDW, we observe a strong two-phonon mode that softens substantially upon cooling, which suggests the presence of substantial lattice distortions at temperatures as high as 250 K. This correlates with the ARPES observation of the persistence of a CDW energy gap above T CDW and finite-temperature DFT calculations of the phonon band structure that \u2026",
