            "The results of a systematic study of the optical properties of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x-based insulators and superconductors are reported. Specifically, we present measurements and analysis of the optical reflectivity R of a series of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x crystals in the frequency range from 30 to 20 000 cm\u2212 1 (4 meV to 2.5 eV), and temperature range from 10 to 270 K. From R we obtain the real part of the frequency-dependent optical conductivity \u03c3 (\u03c9) by Kramers-Kronig analysis. In our discussion, we emphasize the development of structure and spectral weight in \u03c3 (\u03c9) as the compounds change from insulators to high-T c superconductors with varying O content or Al doping. We identify the free carrier, and interband components of \u03c3 (\u03c9), and focus on the free-carrier component.",

Strong interband electronic scattering in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 is observed through interference effects with certain phonons. Below T c, this electronic scattering undergoes a redistribution due to gap formation, which is monitored by a rapid change in the damping rates of the strongly coupled phonons. Our lowest temperature data further indicates the presence of residual electronic scattering well below the expected 2\u0394 gap onset, suggesting that a continuum of electronic states exists inside the gap.",

Our doping-dependence studies show that the redistribution of spectral weight in the CuO 2 planes of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x differs significantly from that seen in La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4. We also find that the redistribution of spectral weight in the cuprates is primarily responsible for the loss of two-magnon Raman-scattering intensity with doping. Finally, we show that bound-carrier contributions comprise a significantly larger fraction of the spectral weight below 1 eV in lower-T c cuprates such as the 2: 1: 4 compounds than in higher-T c cuprates such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8.",

Gap anisotropy is investigated by studying the peak in the low-temperature Raman continuum in various symmetries. Roughly a 35% difference in the energy of this peak is observed between different symmetries, suggesting the presence of substantial gap anisotropy. Anisotropy is further evidenced by the damping behavior of the 340-cm\u2212 1 Raman-active phonon below T c, which displays increased attenuation due to phonon-induced pair breaking. The temperature dependence of this attenuation is consistent with a T= 0 pair-breaking peak which is much larger than the 340-cm\u2212 1 phonon in certain regions of the Fermi surface.",

The metal-semiconductor transition in the A 1\u2212 x A x\u2032 MnO 3 system is characterized by a change from a diffusive electronic Raman-scattering response in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase, to a flat continuum scattering response in the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. We interpret this change in the scattering response as a crossover from a small-polaron-dominated regime at high temperatures to a large-polaron-dominated low-temperature regime. Interestingly, we observe evidence for the coexistence of large and small polarons in the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. We contrast these results with those obtained for EuB 6, which is a low-T c magnetic semiconductor with similar properties to the manganites, but with a substantially reduced \u2026",

This suggests a fundamental connection between superconductivity and fluctuations in some other order parameter. To better understand this connection, we used high-pressure X-ray scattering to directly study the CDW order in the layered dichalcogenide TiSe 2, which was previously shown to exhibit superconductivity when the CDW is suppressed by pressure 1 or intercalation of Cu atoms 2. We succeeded in suppressing the CDW fully to zero temperature, establishing for the first time the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) at P c= 5.1\u00b10.2 GPa, which is more than 1 GPa beyond the end of the superconducting region. Unexpectedly, at P= 3 GPa we observed a reentrant, weakly first order, incommensurate \u2026",

            "We have studied the development of the optical conductivity as electrons are added to the Cu-O planes in Pr 2\u2212 x Ce x CuO 4\u2212 \u03b4 by varying x (0\u2264 x\u2264 0.2). In the metallic phases, contributions to the optical conductivity below 3 eV arise from three sources: mobile carriers, mid-infrared excitations, and charge-transfer excitations. The mobile carrier spectral weight grows roughly linearly with x, while the mid-infrared band appears to evolve at low doping via a transfer of spectral weight from the charge-transfer band. Comparing these results with hole doping in La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4\u2212 \u03b4 indicates an electron-hole symmetry that is not anticipated by standard charge-transfer insulator models.",

            "We have measured the insulating energy gap \u0394 and the exchange interaction J in a series of cuprate crystals, including T\u2019-phase M 2 CuO 4 (M= Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd), T*-phase La, Tb, Sr 2 CuO 4, and T-phase La 2 CuO 4. We find that the energy gap scales predominantly with the in-plane Cu-O distance, scaling as \u03b4 log\u0394\/\u03b4 logd\u223c-6. Furthermore, contrary to simple expectations, the energy gap increases with decreasing Cu-O distance, suggesting that Coulomb and other repulsive energies dominate the effects of band hybridization. Using a three-band Hubbard-model expression, our studies of \u0394 and J in the cuprates allow us to estimate that the hopping energy t scales with Cu-O distance as \u03b4 logt\/\u03b4 logd\u223c-4.",
