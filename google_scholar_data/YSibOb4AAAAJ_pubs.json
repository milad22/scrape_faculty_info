The \u03c0-electronic band structure and the phonon spectrum of the nanotube are both calculated from graphene by the zone-folding method. Scattering rates are calculated using first-order perturbation theory and the deformation-potential approximation, while the selection rules for the electron-phonon interaction are developed based on the conservation of crystal momentum. The steady-state transport properties of electrons in small-diameter nanotubes are simulated using the Monte Carlo method. Results show negative differential mobility occurring at smaller threshold fields as the tube diameter increases. The peak drift velocity is also found to depend on the tube diameter, and reaches values as high as 5\u00d7 10 7 c m\/s in the largest tube \u2026",

Using a quasi-two-dimensional depth dependent Coulomb mobility model for scattering due to interface and oxide charge, along with existing models for other scattering mechanisms, and an in-house drift diffusion device simulator tailored for SiC MOSFETs, we have extracted values for interface trap density of states for 4H-SiC MOSFETs. Characterization shows that the interface trapped charge in 4H-SiC MOSFETs is responsible for mobility degradation and reduction in mobile inversion charge, and therefore reduced current. Its effect on mobility degradation decreases at higher gate voltages due to increased screening. Our results show that at high gate voltages, surface roughness plays the major role in surface mobility degradation in 4H \u2026",

            "The theory of semiclassical carrier transport in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes is presented. The focus is on transport in response to a small, axially applied field. Carriers are considered to scatter with longitudinal, torsional, and radial breathing acoustic phonons. Theory predicts large mobilities and large mean free paths, each increasing with increasing tube diameter. This results from a small effective mass, which varies inversely with the nanotube diameter. In large diameter tubes, the carrier mobility at 300 K is approximately 10 5 cm 2 V s, while the mean free path approaches 0.5\u2212 0.8 \u03bc m. Results depend on the lattice temperature, Poisson\u2019s ratio, and the chirality angle of the nanotube. Theoretical results compare very well with experiments on long semiconducting carbon nanotubes. This indicates that transport in long single-walled carbon nanotubes is likely limited by phonon scattering at \u2026",

Our computed bands show that ribbons of graphene have increased numbers of zigzag edge states, and decreased armchair band gaps, when multilayered. Armchair ribbons are known to obey three families of gap-to-width relationships; we further find that carrier group velocity v F varies by family: small gaps have ideal v F, and large gaps have\u00b120% deviations from ideal v F. Boltzmann carrier transport simulations from calculated phonon scattering show a similar, familial conductance behavior, with peak field-effect mobility and saturated, small-field conductance increasing linearly with ribbon width.",

These traps become filled during inversion causing a lowering of conduction charge in the inversion layer, and increases Coulombic scattering of mobile charges. Owing to the large number of occupied interface traps, Coulomb interaction is likely to be an important scattering mechanism for SiC MOSFET device operation, resulting in very low surface mobilities. We have developed a first principles physics-based Coulomb scattering mobility model to understand this phenomenon and to study its effect on mobility in SiC devices. This type of Coulombic scattering is a quasi-two-dimensional phenomenon.
