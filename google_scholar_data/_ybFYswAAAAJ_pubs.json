            "We review the technical progress made in the past several years in the area of mono- and polycrystalline thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies based on Si, III\u2013V, II\u2013VI, and I\u2013III\u2013VI2 semiconductors, as well as nano-PV. PV electricity is one of the best options for sustainable future energy requirements of the world. At present, the PV market is growing rapidly at an annual rate of 35\u201340%, with PV production around 10.66 GW in 2009. Si and GaAs monocrystalline solar cell efficiencies are very close to the theoretically predicted maximum values. Mono- and polycrystalline wafer Si solar cells remain the predominant PV technology with module production cost around $1.50 per peak watt. Thin-film PV was developed as a means of substantially reducing the cost of solar cells. Remarkable progress has been achieved in this field in recent years. CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells demonstrated record \u2026",

            "Highly conductive and transparent tin-doped CdO:Sn were deposited via atmospheric metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Dimethylcadmium (DMCd), tetramethyltin (TMT), and O2 were used to deposit the CdO:Sn films. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of the fabricated films were influenced by the partial pressures of DMCd and TMT, substrate temperature, film thickness, and annealing conditions. A sheet resistance of 14\u201317 \u03a9\/sq was obtained for as-deposited CdO:Sn films with a thickness of 120\u2013150 nm. The high conductivity of the films was mainly due to their high carrier concentration (2\u20133\u00d71021\/cm3) and moderate mobility (12\u201313 cm2\/V s). The transmission of the films in the visible range was high (80\u201395%) and shifted towards the blue region due to the Moss-Burstein (M-B) effect. The films exhibited direct and indirect band-to-band transitions, which corresponded to optical bandgaps of \u2026",

            "Cadmium telluride (CdTe) has long been recognized as a strong candidate for thin film solar cell applications. It has a bandgap of 1.45 eV, which is nearly ideal for photovoltaic energy conversion. Due to its high optical absorption coefficient essentially all incident radiation with energy above its band-gap is absorbed within 1\u20132 \u03bcm from the surface. Thin film CdTe solar cells are typically heterojunctions, with cadmium sulfide (CdS) being the n-type junction partner. Small area efficiencies have reached the 16.0% level and considerable efforts are underway to commercialize this technology. This paper will present work carried out at the University South Florida sponsored by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the United States Department of Energy, on CdTe\/CdS solar cells fabricated using the close spaced sublimation (CSS) process. The CSS technology has attractive features for large area applications \u2026",
