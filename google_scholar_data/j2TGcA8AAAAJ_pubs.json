            "We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification.

            "IN Western Europe and the United States approximately 1 in 12 women develop breast cancer. A small proportion of breast cancer cases, in particular those arising at a young age, are attributable to a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant predisposition to the disease. The breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2, was recently localized to chromosome 13q12-q13. Here we report the identification of a gene in which we have detected six different germline mutations in breast cancer families that are likely to be due to BRCA2. Each mutation causes serious disruption to the open reading frame of the transcriptional unit. The results indicate that this is the BRCA2 gene.",
