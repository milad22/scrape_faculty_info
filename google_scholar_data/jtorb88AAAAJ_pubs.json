            "This review seeks to summarize the recent developments in the synthesis, structural characterization, properties, and applications in the fields of amorphous, bulk amorphous, and nanocrystalline soft magnetic materials. Conventional physical metallurgical approaches to improving soft ferromagnetic properties have relied on the optimization of chemical and microstructural features. Within the last decade, the development and rapid increase in research of nanocrystalline materials has shown that through proper modifications, revolutionary contributions can be made to better materials\u2019 properties. A wide range of materials\u2019 properties are examined in this review, including: kinetics and thermodynamics, structure, microstructure, and intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties.",

Through a thermal-cycling procedure and through variations in the measuring temperature over the range 10\u201330 K, we manage to commence magnetic relaxation from a range of values of the magnetization, M, or current density J. Analysis of relaxation measurements at a magnetic field of 1.0 T over the temperature range 10\u201330 K reveals a nonlinear dependence of the effective activation energy U e on M or J that is consistent with the logarithmic dependence obtained by Zeldov et al. from transport measurements. This demonstration of a nonlinear dependence of U e (M) is capable of resolving anomalies in the magnitudes and temperature dependence of flux-creep activation energies obtained from magnetic-relaxation studies.",

In particular recent work in nanocrystalline materials is reviewed, with either soft or hard behavior as well as advances in the magnetic materials used for magnetic recording. The role of microstructure on the extrinsic magnetic properties of the materials is stressed and it is emphasized how careful control of the microstructure has played an important role in their improvement. Important microstructural features such as grain size, grain shape and crystallographic texture all are major contributors to the properties of the materials. In addition, the critical role that new instrumentation has played in the better understanding of the nano-phase magnetic materials is demonstrated.",

Particle size is approximately 7 nm as determined by x-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Saturation magnetization values are lower than anticipated, but are explained by elemental analysis, particle size, and cation occupancy within the spinel lattice. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis suggests that a significant amount of Zn2+, which normally occupies tetrahedral sites, actually resides in octahedral coordination in a zinc-enriched outer layer of the particles. This \u201cexcess\u201d of diamagnetic Zn can thus contribute to the overall decrease in magnetism. Further, this model can also be used to suggest a formation mechanism in which Zn2+ is incorporated at a later stage in the particle growth process.",

            "Carbon-coated gadolinium carbide nanocrystallites are generated by a process based on the Kratschmer-Huffman carbon-arc method of preparing fullerenes, and a novel magnetic-field-gradient separation technique is used to separate them. This separation of nanocrystalline byproducts of the carbon arc process is a prerequisite for many of the proposed applications of these materials. While the data presented pertain to Gd 2 C 3, this method is generally applicable to any paramagnetic or ferromagnetic compound. Structural characterization by x-ray and electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of a single gadolinium-containing (Gd 2 C 3) phase and excess carbon. The carbide phase exists as 10\u201350 nm spherical particles. SQUID magnetometry shows paramagnetic response attributed to Gd 3+ ions.",

            "Nanocrystalline (NC) ferrite powders have been synthesized using a 50 kW\u20133 MHz rf thermal plasma torch for high-frequency soft magnet applications. A mixed powder of Ni and Fe (Ni:Fe=1:2), a NiFe permalloy powder with additional Fe powder (Ni:Fe=1:2), and a NiFe permalloy powder (Ni:Fe=1:1) were used as precursors for synthesis. Airflow into the reactor chamber was the source of oxygen for oxide formation. XRD patterns clearly show that the precursor powders were transformed into NC ferrite particles with an average particle size of 20\u201330 nm. SEM and TEM studies indicated that NC ferrite particles had well-defined polygonal growth forms with some exhibiting (111) faceting and many with truncated octahedral and truncated cubic shapes. The Ni content in the ferrite particles was observed to increase in going from mixed Ni and Fe to mixed permalloy and iron and finally to only permalloy starting \u2026",
