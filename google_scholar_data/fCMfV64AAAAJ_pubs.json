All four compounds exhibit paraelectric\u2212antiferroelectric phase transition behavior in the temperature range 160\u2212185 K (Mn: 185 K, Fe: 160 K; Co: 165 K; Ni: 180 K); this is associated with an order\u2212disorder transition involving the hydrogen bonded dimethylammonium cations. On further cooling, the compounds become canted weak ferromagnets below 40 K. This research opens up a new class of multiferroics in which the electrical ordering is achieved by means of hydrogen bonding.",

The observation of QSL states is a central aim of experimental physics, because they host collective excitations that transcend our knowledge of quantum matter; however, examples in real materials are scarce 2. Here, we report neutron-scattering experiments on YbMgGaO 4, a QSL candidate in which Yb 3+ ions with effective spin-1\/2 occupy a triangular lattice 3, 4, 5, 6. Our measurements reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations\u2014the essential experimental hallmark of a QSL 7\u2014at very low temperature (0.06 K). The origin of this peculiar excitation spectrum is a crucial question, because isotropic nearest-neighbour interactions do not yield a QSL ground state on the triangular lattice 8.

With increasing piece length, these coated conductors are within reach of large scale commercial applications. However, data on the physical properties of Hastelloy C-276 at temperatures relevant for these applications are not yet available. In this work, physical properties including magnet succeptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and the Seebeck coefficient are measured from 2to300K and thermal conductivity from 2to200K. Our results show that Hastelloy C-276 exhibits Curie paramagnetism between 4 and 300K with a Curie constant C=0.091K. A spin-glass-like behavior is observed below 3K. The electrical resistivity has a minimum at \u223c12K, and shows a linear weak T dependence at higher temperatures. The specific \u2026",

We found that the competition between the ferromagnetic metallic (FM) and paramagnetic insulating (PI) phases plays an important role in the observed colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect. Based on a scenario that the doped manganites approximately consist of phase-separated FM and PI regions, a simple phenomenological model was proposed to describe the CMR effect. Using this model, we calculated the resistivity as functions of temperature and magnetic field. The model not only qualitatively accounts for some main features related to the CMR effect, but also quantitatively agrees with the experimental observations.",

            "Using magnetic, thermal, and neutron measurements on single-crystal samples, we show that Ba 3 CoSb 2 O 9 is a spin-1\/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet with the c axis as the magnetic easy axis and two magnetic phase transitions bracketing an intermediate up-up-down phase in magnetic field applied along the c axis. A pronounced extensive neutron-scattering continuum above spin-wave excitations, observed below T N, implies that the system is in close proximity to one of two spin-liquid states that have been predicted for a 2D triangular lattice.",
