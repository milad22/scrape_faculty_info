            "The main objective of customer satisfaction programs is to increase customer retention rates. In explaining the link between customer satisfaction and loyalty, switching costs play an important role and provide useful insight. For example, the presence of switching costs can mean that some seemingly loyal customers are actually dissatisfied but do not defect because of high switching costs. Thus, the level of switching costs moderates the link between satisfaction and loyalty. The purposes of this paper are: to examine the moderating role of switching costs in the customer satisfaction\u2010loyalty link; and to identify customer segments and then analyze the heterogeneity in the satisfaction\u2010loyalty link among the different segments. An empirical example based on the mobile phone service market in France indicates support for the moderating role of switching costs. Managerial implications of the results are discussed.",

            "Consumer heterogeneity is fundamental to the marketing concept, providing the basis for market segmentation, targeting and positioning, as well as micro-marketing. Substantial effort has already been devoted to incorporate heterogeneity in brand choice models. However, most of the research in this area has focused on differences in preferences or tastes across consumers. In contrast, limited attention has been given to the possibility that consumers might also differ in the process they follow when making choices. Failure to account for either form of consumer heterogeneity may lead to misinterpretations of market structure and market segments, as demonstrated in our simulations.Our main research objective in this paper is to account for these two forms of consumer heterogeneity with an integrated model. We develop a choice model that simultaneously identities consumer segments on the basis of their \u2026",

            "In a situation where several hundred new music albums are released each month, producing sales forecasts in a reliable and consistent manner is a rather difficult and cumbersome task. The purpose of this study is to obtain sales forecasts for a new album before it is introduced. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model based on a logistic diffusion process. It allows for the generalization of various adoption patterns out of discrete data and can be applied in a situation where the eventual number of adopters is unknown. Using sales of previous albums along with information known prior to the launch of a new album, the model constructs informed priors, yielding prelaunch sales forecasts, which are out-of-sample predictions. In the context of new product forecasting before introduction, the information we have is limited to the relevant background characteristics of a new album.

Valuing customers and measuring marketing effect using only direct financial contributions, however, carries a potential risk of misleading marketing managers since much of the relationship-based indicators are latent such as word of mouth (WOM) but still contribute substantially to customer lifetime value (CLV). In this paper, based on the company data and simulation, we empirically investigate the effect of WOM in estimating CLV. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed.",

            "Generalized structured component analysis (GSCA) is a component-based approach to structural equation modeling. In practice, researchers may often be interested in examining the interaction effects of latent variables. However, GSCA has been geared only for the specification and testing of the main effects of variables. Thus, an extension of GSCA is proposed to effectively deal with various types of interactions among latent variables. In the proposed method, a latent interaction is defined as a product of interacting latent variables. As a result, this method does not require the construction of additional indicators for latent interactions. Moreover, it can easily accommodate both exogenous and endogenous latent interactions. An alternating least-squares algorithm is developed to minimize a single optimization criterion for parameter estimation. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to investigate the \u2026",

The second factor is the role of the timing of the formation of intentions prior to purchase. While one stream of literature based on preference fluency predicts that early formation of intentions is more likely to lead to actual purchase, the other stream based on the memory-based \u201crecency\u201d effect predicts that formation of intentions just prior to purchase is more likely to lead to actual purchase.

Of particular interest was to compare and contrast the effects of consumer characteristics on evaluations of line extensions with those of brand extensions.
