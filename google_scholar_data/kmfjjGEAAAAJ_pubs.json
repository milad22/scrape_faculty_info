Unfortunately, the answer is in part a \u201cmoving target\u201d as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria, only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas.

            "The rapidly increasing use of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in consumer products and medical applications has raised ecological and human health concerns. A key question for addressing these concerns is whether Ag NP toxicity is mechanistically unique to nanoparticulate silver, or if it is a result of the release of silver ions. Furthermore, since Ag NPs are produced in a large variety of monomer sizes and coatings, and since their physicochemical behavior depends on the media composition, it is important to understand how these variables modulate toxicity. We found that a lower ionic strength medium resulted in greater toxicity (measured as growth inhibition) of all tested Ag NPs to Caenorhabditis elegans and that both dissolved silver and coating influenced Ag NP toxicity. We found a linear correlation between Ag NP toxicity and dissolved silver, but no correlation between size and toxicity. We used three \u2026",

Many diseases have been identified as caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, and many pharmaceuticals have been identified as previously unrecognized mitochondrial toxicants.

We briefly review the importance of mitochondrial function and maintenance for health based on the genetics of mitochondrial diseases and the toxicities resulting from pharmaceutical exposure. We then discuss how the principles of mitochondrial vulnerability illustrated by those fields might apply to environmental contaminants, with particular attention to factors that may modulate vulnerability including genetic differences, epigenetic interactions, tissue characteristics, and developmental stage.

QPCR can be used to quantify the formation of DNA damage, as well as the kinetics of damage removal. One of the main strengths of the assay is that it permits monitoring the integrity of mtDNA directly from total cellular DNA without the need for isolating mitochondria, or a separate step of mtDNA purification.

            "We have previously shown that the protein subunit of telomerase, hTERT, has a bonafide N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, and that ectopic hTERT expression in human cells correlated with increase in mtDNA damage after hydrogen peroxide treatment. In this study, we show, using a loxP hTERT construct, that this increase in mtDNA damage following hydrogen peroxide exposure is dependent on the presence of hTERT itself. Further experiments using a dominant negative hTERT mutant shows that telomerase must be catalytically active to mediate the increase in mtDNA damage. Etoposide, but not methylmethanesulfate, also promotes mtDNA lesions in cells expressing active hTERT, indicating genotoxic specificity in this response. Fibroblasts expressing hTERT not only show a \u223c2-fold increase in mtDNA damage after oxidative stress but also suffer a 10\u201330-fold increase in apoptotic cell death \u2026",
