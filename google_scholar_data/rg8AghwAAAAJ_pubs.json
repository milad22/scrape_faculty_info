            "There is an intense, worldwide effort to develop durable lithium ion batteries with high energy and power densities for a wide range of applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. One of the critical challenges in advancing lithium ion battery technologies is fracture and decrepitation of the electrodes as a result of lithium diffusion during charging and discharging operations. When lithium is inserted in either the positive or negative electrode, a large volume change on the order of a few to several hundred percent, can occur. Diffusion-induced stresses (DISs) can therefore cause the nucleation and growth of cracks, leading to mechanical degradation of the active electrode materials. Our work is aimed at developing a mathematical model relating surface energy with diffusion-induced stresses in nanowire electrodes. With decreasing size of the electrode, the ratio of surface area to volume increases \u2026",

            "Coupled mechanical-chemical degradation of electrodes upon charging and discharging has been recognized as a major failure mechanism in lithium ion batteries. The instability of commonly employed electrolytes results in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Although the SEI layer is necessary, as it passivates the electrode-electrolyte interface from further solvent decomposition, SEI formation consumes lithium and thus contributes to irreversible capacity loss. In this paper, we study irreversible capacity loss in a graphite-LiFePO 4 cell. Our results support the mechanism of irreversible capacity loss due to the consumption of lithium in forming SEI. We attribute irreversible capacity loss to diffusion induced stresses (DISs) that cause pre-existing cracks on the electrode surfaces to grow gradually upon cycling, leading to the growth of SEI on the newly exposed electrode surfaces. Because lithium is consumed \u2026",

            "Most lithium-ion battery electrodes experience large volume changes associated with Li concentration changes within the host particles during charging and discharging. Electrode failure, in the form of fracture or decrepitation, can occur as a result of repeated volume changes. It has been found recently that many electrode materials, such as graphite, Si, and, change their elastic properties upon lithiation. However, previous diffusion-induced stress (DIS) models have not considered this relationship. In this paper, we developed a mathematical model, with the assumption of a homogeneous isotropic cylindrical electrode particle, to describe the effect of concentration-dependent Young's modulus on DIS in battery electrodes. The DIS model considers both increasing and decreasing Young's modulus with concentration. The model shows that the concentration dependence of Young's modulus has a significant effect \u2026",

Graphite\/Li (Ni 1\/3 Mn 1\/3 Co 1\/3) O 2 cells of two very different initial anode\/cathode capacity ratios (R, both R> 1) are assembled to investigate the electrochemical behavior. The initial charge capacity of the cathode is observed to be affected by the anode loading, indicating that the electrolyte reactions on the anode affect the electrolyte reactions on the cathode. Additionally, the rate of\" marching\" of the cathode is found to be affected by the anode loading. These findings attest to the\" cross-talk\" between the two electrodes.

Many lithium ion electrode materials undergo formation of two or more phases during lithium insertion or removal. In this work, we mathematically investigate the DISs in phase transforming electrodes using a core-shell structural model. We examine the concentration jumps at phase boundaries that result in stress discontinuities, which in turn can cause cracking. The influence of the mechanical properties of the two phases on stress evolution, stress discontinuity, and strain energy are clarified. The trends obtained with the model may be used to help tune electrode materials with appropriate interfacial and bulk properties so as to increase the durability of battery electrodes.",

A goal of such efforts is to understand and predict particle fracture, which is sometimes observed in degraded electrodes. In this paper we present experimental data on LiCoO2 and graphite active particles, consistent with previously published data, showing the presence of numerous internal pores or cracks in both positive and negative active electrode particles. New calculations presented here show that the presence of free surfaces, from even small internal cracks or pores, both quantitatively and qualitatively alters the internal stress distributions such that particles are prone to internal cracking rather than to the surface cracking that had been predicted previously.

Several promising anode materials, such as Si, Ge, and Sn, have theoretical capacities several times larger than that of the commercially used graphite negative electrode. However, their applications are limited because of the short cycle life due to fracture caused by diffusion-induced stresses (DISs) and the large volume change during electrochemical cycling. Here we present a strategy to achieve high capacity and improved durability of electrode materials using low-melting point metallic alloys. With gallium as an example, we show that at a temperature above the melting point of Ga, a reversible solid-liquid transition occurs upon lithiation (lithium insertion) and delithiation (lithium extraction) of Ga. As a result, cracks formed in the lithiated solid state can be\" healed\" once \u2026",
