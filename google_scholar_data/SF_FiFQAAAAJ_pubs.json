            "Nonlinear compression of laser pulses with tens of millijoule energy in a gas-filled multipass cell is a promising approach to realize a new generation of high average power femtosecond sources. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate nonlinear broadening of pulses with about 18 mJ of energy at a 5 kHz repetition rate in an argon-filled Herriott cell and show compressibility from 1.3 ps to 41 fs. In addition to the large compression factor, the output beam has an outstanding quality and excellent spectral homogeneity. Furthermore, we discuss prospects to scale the energy to the 100 mJ level in the near future.",

An original two-channel laser system based on parametric amplification in \u03b2-BaB 2 O 4 and LiB 3 O 5 crystals was created. High-contrast laser pulses, with up to 100 mJ of energy and with a pulse duration of 23 fs, were generated in both channels. An original setup for active timing-jitter stabilization was developed. It allowed reduction of the relative timing jitter of the amplified pulses to 40 as, which enabled coherent combining with an efficiency as high as 95%.
