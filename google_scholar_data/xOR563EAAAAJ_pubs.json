            "Increasing evidence suggests that glutamate neurotoxicity is partly mediated by reactive oxygen species, formed as a consequence of several processes, including arachidonic acid metabolism and nitric oxide production. Here we used an oxidation-sensitive indicator, dihydrorhodamine 123, in combination with confocal microscopy, to examine the hypothesis that electron transport by neuronal mitochondria may be an important source of glutamate-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Exposure to NMDA, but not kainate, ionomycin, or elevated potassium stimulated oxygen radical production in cultured murine cortical neurons, demonstrated by oxidation of nonfluorescent dihydrorhodamine 123 to fluorescent rhodamine 123. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies using 5,5-dimethyl-1- pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a radical-trapping agent, also showed production of ROS by cortical neurons \u2026",

            "Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a demyelinating autoimmune disorder that can be induced in susceptible mice by T lymphocytes sensitized to central nervous system (CNS) myelin components and is a prime animal model for the human CNS demyelinating disorder, multiple sclerosis (MS). Although CNS inflammation in which T lymphocytes and activated macrophages are the predominant cell types is observed in mice with EAE and in humans with MS, the exact mechanisms underlying the CNS damage and demyelination are not understood. Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous free radical, has recently been shown to be a cytolytic product of activated macrophages. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the nitric oxide free radical complexed with iron-sulfur proteins has been identified in affected spinal cords of mice with EAE, concurrent with the diminution of iron-sulfur proteins.

Thus far an enhancement of 5500 of the naphthalene proton polarization has been reached. For this purpose, a newly developed technique, the integrated solid effect, performed while obeying the Hartmann-Hahn condition, is used to transfer the triplet polarization efficiently to the nuclear spin system.",
