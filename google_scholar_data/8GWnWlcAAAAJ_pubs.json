The average shower maximum was found to evolve with energy at a rate of (106\u2212 21+ 35) g\/cm 2\/decade below 10 18.24\u00b10.05 eV, and (24\u00b13) g\/cm 2\/decade above this energy.

The two spectra are combined addressing the systematic uncertainties and, in particular, the influence of the energy resolution on the spectral shape. The spectrum can be described by a broken power law E\u2212 \u03b3 with index \u03b3= 3.3 below the ankle which is measured at log 10 (E ankle\/eV)= 18.6. Above the ankle the spectrum is described by a power law with index 2.6 followed by a flux suppression, above about log 10 (E\/eV)= 19.5, detected with high statistical significance.",

The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than \u223c6 \u00d7 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than \u223c75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuz\u2019min effect).
