            "OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to assess current and potential future application for laparoscopy (DL) in the diagnosis of penetrating and blunt injuries. Efficacy, safety, and cost analyses were performed. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) and computed tomography (CT) have been the mainstays in recent years for diagnosis of equivocal nontherapeutic laparotomy, whereas CT is not helpful for the vast majority of penetrating wounds. DL may be a useful adjunct to fill in these gaps. METHODS: Hemodynamically stable patients with equivocal evidence of intraabdominal injury were prospectively entered into the protocol. DL was performed under general anesthesia; patients with wounds penetrating the peritoneum or blunt injury with significant organ injury underwent laparotomy. RESULTS: Over 19 months, 182 patients (55% stab, 36% GSW, 9% blunt) were studied. No \u2026",

We hypothesize that further major reduction in injury mortality will be obtained through injury prevention, rather than improvements in therapy.MethodsSeven hundred fifty-three deaths in an American College of Surgeons\u2013verified, Level I trauma center were reviewed as they occurred. Deaths were classified as therapeutically not preventable, possibly preventable, or preventable. These charts were also reviewed for factors that might have prevented or lessened the severity of the injury.ResultsMean age was 43, mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5, mean Revised Trauma Score was 4, mean Injury Severity Score was 41, and mean probability of survival was 0.25 (according to TRISS).

In 5755 appendectomies, our overall rate of complicated appendicitis was 32 per cent; higher in males, in the young, and in the elderly; and relatively stable over each year reviewed. Prospectively, we determined that of the various time intervals, the time from the onset of symptoms to first seeking medical attention is the only significant predictor of complicated appendicitis (39.8 vs 16.5 hours for acute appendicitis). On the other hand, the time from surgical evaluation to operative intervention was significantly shorter for complicated appendicitis (3.8 vs 4.7 hours for acute \u2026",

Additionally, the high rate of NOM in children (up to 79%) has been attributed to their management by pediatric surgeons. We evaluated our experience with NOM of blunt splenic injury with special attention to these age groups.MethodsBy using our trauma registry, all patients with blunt splenic injuries (documented by computed tomography, operative findings, or both) cared for over a 36-month period, at a single American College of Surgeons verified Level I trauma center were reviewed.

            "Background:The safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of arterial trauma using the Wallgraft Endoprosthesis was evaluated in a subgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized registry trial with a historical control to surgical management. Endpoints were exclusion success at procedure and at 12-months, primary patency and freedom-from-bypass at 12-months, and major adverse events.Methods:Sixty-two patients were treated for arterial trauma from October 1997 to June 2003. The anatomic locations of the injuries were: iliac (33), subclavian (18), and femoral (11) arteries. Indication for treatment was perforation\/rupture (33), acute pseudoaneurysm (10), AV fistula (16), and dissection (3). Exclusion and patency were assessed using arteriography, duplex ultrasound, CT, or MRA at postprocedure and 12-months. Major adverse event and mortality rates were compared with surgical \u2026",

            "Resection with primary anastomosis was associated with a 14% anastomotic leak rate in this review of 60 patients with destructive colon wounds. The presence of an underlying medical illness or massive blood transfusion was associated with anastomotic complications. In the high-risk subset of patients who had one or both of these risk factors, the anastomotic leak rate was 42%. The incidence of anastomotic leak in previously healthy patients without massive transfusion was 3%. Ileocolostomies were no safer than colocolostomies. We conclude that resection with anastomosis should not be performed on all patients with destructive colon injuries, as the risk of anastomotic leak is prohibitive in those with either massive blood loss or underlying medical illness. We continue to perform primary anastomosis in healthy patients without excessive blood loss.",
