This was an unprecedented coordinated observational campaign. These data show that (i) there was new material after impact that was compositionally different from that seen before impact; (ii) the ratio of dust mass to gas mass in the ejecta was much larger than before impact; (iii) the new activity did not last more than a few days, and by 9 July the comet9s behavior was indistinguishable from its pre-impact behavior; and (iv) there were interesting transient phenomena that may be correlated with cratering physics.",

This investigation is based on millimetre\/submillimetre observations made with the IRAM 30-m, SEST, CSO and Kitt Peak 12-m telescopes. Although these four comets are expected to originate from the Oort cloud, they present significant differences in molecular abundances, especially as regards to the most volatile species: CO and H2S. In particular comet C\/2000 WM1 looks quite depleted in these volatiles, suggesting it may have a different origin than the others. Heliocentric variations of molecular relative abundance in the coma are also investigated. Significant increases in the CS\/HCN and HNC\/HCN production rate ratios \u2026",

A runaway fragmentation of the nucleus may have begun around 18 July 2000 and proceeded until 23 July. The mass in small icy debris (\u226430-centimeter radius) was comparable to the mass in the large fragments seen in optical images. The mass budget after breakup suggests a small nucleus (\u223c100- to 300-meter radius) that had been losing debris for weeks. The HNC, H2CO, H2S, and CS abundances relative to H2O measured during breakup are consistent with those obtained in other comets. However, a deficiency in CH3OH and CO is observed.",

Chiron's unusual, 51-year orbit ranges in distance from 8.5 to just over 19 AU, and exhibits an inclination to the ecliptic plane of 8.5 deg. Recent dynamical studies (Levison and Duncan, 1994; Dones et al., 1996) show this orbit is unstable to giant-planet perturbations on timescales of< 106 years, indicating that it is a recent addition to the planetary region. This, along with its low-inclination orbit, and its size similarity to the newly-discovered population of 100-400-km-diameter Kuiper Disk objects (Campins et al., 1994; Jewitt and Luu, 1995), provides strong circumstantial evidence that Chiron is an escaped object from the Kuiper Disk. Chiron's present orbit subjects it to much more intense insolation than objects in the Kuiper Disk experience. That insolation generates surface activity, as revealed by a highly variable \u2026",

The ionic species CO+, N2+, CH+, and H2O+ were identified in these spectra and column densities for them were calcd. from measured fluxes.  The obsd. abundance ratios of CO+\/H2O+ in comets Halley and Bradfield are consistent with predictions by photochem. models, provided that CO+ and H2O+ are produced primarily from photoionization of CO and H2O, resp.  However, the obsd. N2+\/H2O+ ratios are at least an order of magnitude lower and the obsd. CH+\/H2O+ ratios are a factor of 100 higher, than theor. results.  The abundance ratio N2\/CO was derived in the plasma tail of Bradfield from N2+ and CO+ data, and found to be an order of magnitude higher than a value measured in Halley.  The relative ion abundances of CH+, N2+, and H2O+ in Halley are consistent with in situ measurements obtained from the Giotto spacecraft.

            "The activity of most comets near the Sun is dominated by the sublimation of frozen water, the most abundant ice in comets. Some comets, however, are active well beyond the water-ice sublimation limit of~ 3 au. Three bodies dominate the observational record and modeling efforts for distantly active comets: the long-period comet C\/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), and the short-period comets (with Centaur orbits) 29P\/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 and 2060 Chiron. We summarize what is known about these three objects with an emphasis on their gaseous comae. We calculate their CN\/CO and CO 2\/CO production rate ratios from the literature and discuss implications, such as HCN and CO 2 outgassing are not significant contributors to their comae. Using our own data we derive CO production rates, Q (CO), for all three objects to examine whether there is a correlation between gas production and different orbital histories and \u2026",

            "Observations of formaldehyde (H2CO) have been conducted toward comets C\/1995 O1 (Hale\u2010Bopp), C\/2001 Q4 (NEAT), and C\/2002 T7 (LINEAR) using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope at 1.2 and 2 mm. Aperture synthesis maps of H2CO at 3 mm were made using the Berkeley\u2010Illinois\u2010Maryland Association (BIMA) interferometer toward comet Hale\u2010Bopp. These data indicate that the production rate of H2CO is \u223c  s\u22121 at \u223c1 AU in comet Hale\u2010Bopp, using a simple Monte Carlo model, if a nuclear origin for the molecule is assumed. However, maps of H2CO in Hale\u2010Bopp, in comparison with CO, show an extended distribution ( ,000 km) with small\u2010scale structure oriented roughly along the comet\u2010Sun direction. This result suggests a source of H2CO other than the comet nucleus. The extended source of formaldehyde is probably grains composed of a mixture of silicates and organic material \u2026",
