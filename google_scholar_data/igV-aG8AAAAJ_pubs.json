In addition to investigating the potential nonlinear relationships between exploratory and exploitative learning and new product performance, the authors examine the relationship between the interaction of the two types of learning and new product performance. The findings suggest that different dimensions of social capital are indeed significantly related to the level of exploratory and exploitative learning. The results also support the argument that firms need a balance of exploratory and exploitative learning to enhance performance. The findings draw the attention of managers from multinational firms operating in China to the important role of social capital in enhancing new product performance.",

            "Global sourcing strategy has been one of the most hotly debated management trends in the last 20 years. In its early years, global sourcing was examined mostly from \u201cin-house\u201d development and procurement perspectives; and in the last several years, research focus has shifted to \u201coutsourcing\u201d activities. Along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. Although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. Furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy \u2026",

Moreover, coordination mechanism strengthens, and cost leadership strategy weakens, the effects of market orientation on new product development and marketing communication capabilities, respectively. Market turbulence attenuates the effect of market orientation on new product development capability while competitive intensity strengthens this effect.",

            "Global procurement of services has been receiving an increasing amount of managerial attention in recent years. Service firms seem to have begun sourcing part of their service activities from abroad in much the same way as manufacturing firms have sourced components and finished goods in the past 30 years. However, little is known about the nature of service sourcing strategy. In this study, we employ a modified transaction\u2013cost analysis to examine empirically the locational (domestic vs. global sourcing) and the ownership (internal vs. external sourcing) aspects of service sourcing strategy. In addition, performance implications on both the locational and ownership aspects of service sourcing are investigated. The results show that, similar to components and finished goods procurement, supplementary services are sourced globally, either internally or externally. Furthermore, the relationship between asset \u2026",

However, the results provided no support for bargaining power of suppliers and transaction frequency as moderator variables. In other words, in achieving high financial performance for a product, whether a particular sourcing strategy should be used for a particular product depended on the levels of product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity.",
