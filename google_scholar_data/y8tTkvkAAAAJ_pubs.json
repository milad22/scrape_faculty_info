            "MICE with targeted disruptions 1 in Hoxgenes have been generated to evaluate the role of the Hox complex in determining the mammalian body plan. This complex of 38 genes encodes transcription factors that specify regional information along the embryonic axes. Early in vertebrate evolution an ancestral complex shared with invertebrates was duplicated twice to give rise to the four linkage groups (Hox A, B, C and D) 2, 3. As a consequence, corresponding genes on the separate linkage groups, called paralogues, are most closely related to each other. Based on sequence similarities, the Hox genes have been subdivided into 13 paralogous groups. The five most 5\u2032 groups (Hox9\u201313) pattern the posterior region of the vertebrate embryo and the appendicular skeleton 4\u201318. Mice with individual mutations in the paralogous genes hoxa-11 and hoxd-11 have been described 15\u201318. By breeding these two strains \u2026",

CTD's initial approach was to facilitate comparisons of nucleotide and protein sequences of toxicologically significant genes by curating these sequences and electronically annotating them with chemical terms from their associated references. Since then, however, CTD has vastly expanded its scope to robustly represent a triad of chemical\u2013gene, chemical\u2013disease and gene\u2013disease interactions that are manually curated from the scientific literature by professional biocurators using controlled vocabularies, ontologies and structured notation.

            " The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that promotes understanding about the interaction of environmental chemicals with gene products, and their effects on human health. Biocurators at CTD manually curate a triad of chemical\u2013gene, chemical\u2013disease and gene\u2013disease relationships from the literature. These core data are then integrated to construct chemical\u2013gene\u2013disease networks and to predict many novel relationships using different types of associated data. Since 2009, we dramatically increased the content of CTD to 1.4 million chemical\u2013gene\u2013disease data points and added many features, statistical analyses and analytical tools, including GeneComps and ChemComps (to find comparable genes and chemicals that share toxicogenomic profiles), enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with chemicals, statistically ranked chemical\u2013disease inferences, Venn diagram \u2026",
