We present a mechanism which naturally suppresses such dimension-5 operators in the context of SUSY SO (10). The mechanism, which implements natural doublet-triplet splitting using the adjoint Higgs boson, converts these dimension-5 operators effectively into dimension 6. By explicitly computing the Higgs spectrum and the resulting threshold uncertainties we show that the successful prediction of sin 2 \u03b8 W is maintained as a prediction in this scheme. It is argued that only a weak suppression of the Higgsino-mediated proton decay is achievable within SUSY SU (5) without fine-tuning, in contrast to a strong suppression in SUSY SO (10).",

For , the requirement that complex elements be formed suggests that the Higgs vacuum expectation value  must have a magnitude less than 5 times its observed value. For , baryon stability requires that , the Planck Mass. Smaller values of  may or may not be allowed depending on issues of element synthesis and stellar evolution. We conclude that the observed value of  is reasonably typical of the anthropically allowed range, and that anthropic arguments provide a plausible explanation for the closeness of the QCD scale and the weak scale.",
