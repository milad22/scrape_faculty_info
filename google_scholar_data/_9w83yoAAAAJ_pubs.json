Subsequent injection of local anesthetic into the misplaced catheter and delayed detection of the postoperative neurologic deficits resulted in this tragic complication.Permanent paraplegia after epidural anesthesia is extremely rare; the incidence is< 0.02%(1\u20134). The causes are diverse, including epidural hematoma, epidural abscess, direct cord trauma, spinal infarction, and neurotoxicity by accidental subarachnoid injection or chemical contamination (1, 4).

Adequate anesthesia and analgesia obtained from thoracic epidural anesthetic (TEA) allow VATS to be performed in awake patients. The potential general anesthesia-related adverse effects, such as intubation-related trauma, pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, effects of neuromuscular blocking agents, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, can thus be avoided. Moreover, TEA holds the benefits of reducing pulmonary and cardiac morbidities and mortalities after noncardiac surgery. Patients who undergo awake VATS may also benefit from the efficient contraction of the dependent hemidiaphragm and preserved hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during surgically-induced pneumothorax.

To investigate the accuracy of preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) in prediction of the distance for low\u2010thoracic epidural insertion, a single group observational study was conducted in 30 male patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery requiring epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief. Using the paramedian approach, low\u2010thoracic epidural insertion at T10\u201311 interspace was performed with a standardized procedure to obtain an actual insertion length (AIL). According to the principles of trigonometry, an estimated insertion length (EIL) was calculated as 1.26 times the distance from skin to epidural space measured from the preoperative abdominal CT. Results. The mean (sd) EIL and AIL were 5.5 (0.7) and 5.1 (0.6) cm, respectively, with a significant correlation (r= 0.899, P< 0.01). The EIL \u2026",
