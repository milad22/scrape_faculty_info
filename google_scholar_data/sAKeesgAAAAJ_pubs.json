For   cm2 s\u22121 , material falls into the black hole almost uninhibited. No outflows are expected. For  , the infalling matter is halted by centrifugal force outside 1000 km where neutrino losses are negligible. The equatorial accretion rate is very low, and explosive oxygen burning may power a weak equatorial explosion. For  , however, a reasonable value for such stars, a compact disk forms at a radius at which the gravitational binding energy can be efficiently radiated as neutrinos or converted to beamed outflow by \u2026",

            "The final chapter in the long-standing mystery of the \u03b3-ray bursts (GRBs) centres on the origin of the short-hard class of bursts, which are suspected on theoretical grounds to result from the coalescence of neutron-star or black-hole binary systems. Numerous searches for the afterglows of short-hard bursts have been made, galvanized by the revolution in our understanding of long-duration GRBs that followed the discovery in 1997 of their broadband (X-ray, optical and radio) afterglow emission. Here we present the discovery of the X-ray afterglow of a short-hard burst, GRB 050709, whose accurate position allows us to associate it unambiguously with a star-forming galaxy at redshift z= 0.160, and whose optical lightcurve definitively excludes a supernova association. Together with results from three other recent short-hard bursts, this suggests that short-hard bursts release much less energy than the long-duration \u2026",

            "We examine the propagation of two\u2010dimensional relativistic jets through the stellar progenitor in the collapsar model for gamma\u2010ray bursts (GRBs). Each jet is parameterized by a radius where it is introduced and by its initial Lorentz factor, opening angle, power, and internal energy. In agreement with previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by their passage through the stellar mantle. Starting with an initial half\u2010angle of up to 20\u00b0, they emerge with half\u2010angles that, though variable with time, are around 5\u00b0. Interaction of these jets with the star and their own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. We speculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variable Lorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex light curves seen in many GRBs. In all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep inside the star following a brief period of adiabatic \u2026",

Long-duration (\u2273 2 s) GRBs are associated with the explosive deaths of massive stars (\u2018collapsars\u2019, ref. 1), which produce accompanying supernovae 2, 3, 4, 5; the short-duration (\u2272 2 s) GRBs have a different origin, which has been argued to be the merger of two compact objects 6, 7, 8, 9. Here we report optical observations of GRB 060614 (duration\u223c 100 s, ref. 10) that rule out the presence of an associated supernova. This would seem to require a new explosive process: either a massive collapsar that powers a GRB without any associated supernova, or a new type of \u2018engine\u2019, as long-lived as the collapsar but without a massive star. We also show that the properties of the host galaxy (redshift z= 0.125) distinguish it from other long \u2026",

Disk surface density within the hole is reduced by orders of magnitude relative to the density in the disk bulk. The inner truncation of the disk resembles the clearing of a gap in a protoplanetary disk. An initially circular disk becomes elliptical and then eccentric.

The very simple power-law spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons  accelerated by a shock launched by a neutron star (NS)\u2013NS merger to date. We find p= 2.17\u00b10.01, which indicates that radiation from ejecta with \u0393~ 3\u201310 dominates the observed emission \u2026",

            "We present the results of two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary disk accretion using the finite-volume code DISCO. This code solves the 2D viscous Navier-Stokes equations on a high-resolution moving mesh which shears with the fluid flow, greatly reducing advection errors in comparison with a fixed grid. We perform a series of simulations for binary mass ratios in the range 0.026\u2264 q\u2264 1.0, each lasting longer than a viscous time so that we reach a quasi-steady accretion state. In each case, we find that gas is efficiently stripped from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and enters the cavity along accretion streams, which feed persistent\" mini disks\" surrounding each black hole. We find that for q gsim 0.1, the binary excites eccentricity in the inner region of the circumbinary disk, creating an overdense lump which gives rise to enhanced periodicity in the accretion rate. The dependence \u2026",

            " We present results from axisymmetric, time\u2010dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the collapsar model for gamma\u2010ray bursts. We begin the simulations after the   iron core of a   presupernova star has collapsed and study the ensuing accretion of the   helium envelope onto the central black hole formed by the collapsed iron core. We consider a spherically symmetric progenitor model but with spherical symmetry broken by the introduction of a small, latitude\u2010dependent angular momentum and a weak radial magnetic field. Our MHD simulations include a realistic equation of state, neutrino cooling, photodisintegration of helium, and resistive heating. Our main conclusion is that, within the collapsar model, MHD effects alone are able to launch, accelerate, and sustain a strong polar outflow. We also find that the outflow is Poynting flux\u2013dominated and note that this provides favorable initial conditions \u2026",
