            "A broad overview of the current status of proton stability in unified models of particle interactions is given which includes non-supersymmetric unification, SUSY and SUGRA unified models, unification based on extra dimensions, and string-M-theory models. The extra dimensional unification includes 5D and 6D and universal extra dimensional (UED) models, and models based on warped geometry. Proton stability in a wide array of string theory and M theory models is reviewed. These include Calabi\u2013Yau models, grand unified models with Kac\u2013Moody levels k> 1, a new class of heterotic string models, models based on intersecting D branes, and string landscape models. The destabilizing effect of quantum gravity on the proton is discussed. The possibility of testing grand unified models, models based on extra dimensions and string-M-theory models via their distinctive modes is investigated. The proposed next \u2026",

In the optimistic scenarios with a small Higgs triplet vacuum expectation value v \u0394< 10\u2212 4 GeV, one can look for clean signals of lepton-number violation in the decays of doubly charged (H\u00b1\u00b1) and singly charged (H\u00b1) Higgs bosons to distinguish the normal hierarchy (NH), the inverted hierarchy (IH), and the quasidegenerate (QD) spectrum for the light neutrino masses. The observation of either H+\u2192 \u03c4+ \u03bd or H+\u2192 e+ \u03bd will be particularly robust for the spectrum test since they are independent of the unknown Majorana phases. The H++ decays moderately depend on a Majorana phase \u03a6 2 in the NH, but sensitively depend on \u03a6 1 in the IH. In a less favorable scenario v \u0394> 2\u00d7 10\u2212 4 GeV, when the leptonic channels are suppressed, one needs to \u2026",

Furthermore, there is a natural suppression of flavor violation in the quark and leptonic sectors since the gauge symmetries and particle content forbid tree level flavor changing neutral currents involving the quarks or charged leptons.

            "We investigate the possibility to find the simplest renormalizable grand unified theory based on the SU (5) gauge symmetry. We find that it is possible to generate all fermion masses with only two Higgs bosons, 5 H and 45 H. In this context the neutrino masses are generated through the type III and type I seesaw mechanisms. The predictions coming from the unification of gauge couplings and the stability of the proton are discussed in detail. In this theory the leptogenesis mechanism can be realized through the out of equilibrium decays of the fermions in the adjoint representation.",
