            "This paper is a review of the present status of neutrino mass physics, which grew out of an APS sponsored study of neutrinos in 2004. After a discussion of the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and some popular ways to probe the new physics implied by recent data, it summarizes what can be learned about neutrino interactions as well as the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model from the various proposed neutrino experiments. The intriguing possibility that neutrino mass physics may be at the heart of our understanding of a long standing puzzle of cosmology, ie the origin of matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry is also discussed.",

This report addresses the possible interplay between the LHC and ILC in testing the Standard Model and in discovering and determining the origin of new physics. Mutual benefits for the physics programme at both machines can occur both at the level of a combined interpretation of Hadron Collider and Linear Collider data and at the level of combined analyses of the data, where results obtained at one machine can directly influence the way analyses are carried out at the other machine. Topics under study comprise the physics of weak and strong electroweak symmetry breaking, supersymmetric models, new gauge theories, models with extra dimensions, and electroweak and QCD precision \u2026",

            "Consistent uplifting of AdS vacua in string theory often requires extra light degrees of freedom in addition to those of a (K\u00e4hler) modulus. Here we consider the possibility that de Sitter and Minkowski vacua arise due to hidden sector matter interactions. We find that, in this scheme, the hierarchically small supersymmetry breaking scale can be explained by the scale of gaugino condensation and that interesting patterns of the soft terms arise. In particular, a matter-dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario and a version of the mirage mediation scheme appear in the framework of spontaneously broken supergravity.",

            "In a previous paper, referred to as a \u201cMini-Landscape\u201d search, we explored a \u201cfertile patch\u201d of the heterotic landscape based on a Z 6\u2212 II orbifold with SO (10) and E 6 local grand unified theory structures. In the present paper we extend this analysis. We find many models with the minimal supersymmetric standard model spectra and an exact R parity. In all of these models, the vectorlike exotics decouple along D-flat directions. We present two benchmark models which satisfy many of the constraints of a realistic supersymmetric model, including nontrivial Yukawa matrices for three families of quarks and leptons and Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos with nontrivial seesaw masses for the three light neutrinos. In an appendix we comment on the important issue of string selection rules and, in particular, the so-called \u201cgamma-rule\u201d.",
