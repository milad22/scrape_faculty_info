            "In universal extra dimension models, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) particle is generically the first KK excitation of the photon and can be stable, serving as particle dark matter. We calculate the thermal relic abundance of the KK photon for a general mass spectrum of KK excitations including full coannihilation effects with all (level-one) KK excitations. We find that including coannihilation can significantly change the relic abundance when the coannihilating particles are within about 20% of the mass of the KK photon. Matching the relic abundance with cosmological data, we find the mass range of the KK photon is much wider than previously found, up to about 2 TeV if the masses of the strongly interacting level-one KK particles are within 5% of the mass of the KK photon. We also find cases where several coannihilation channels compete (constructively and destructively) with one another. The lower bound on the KK \u2026",

In this model, excitations with anyonic statistics are shown to exist at the surface but not in the bulk. The statistics of these surface anyons is explicitly computed and shown to be identical to the three-fermion Z 2 model, a variant of Z 2 topological order which cannot be realized in a purely D= 2 system with time-reversal symmetry. Thus the model realizes a novel surface termination for three-dimensional (3D) SPT phases, that of a fully symmetric gapped surface with topological order. The 3D phase found here was previously proposed from a field theoretic analysis but is outside the group cohomology classification that appears to capture all SPT phases in lower dimensions.

While the symmetry fractionalization must be consistent with the fusion and braiding rules of the anyons, not all ostensibly consistent symmetry fractionalizations can be realized in 2D systems. Instead, certain \u201canomalous\u201d SETs can only occur on the surface of a 3D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In this paper, we describe a procedure for determining whether a SET of a discrete, on-site, unitary symmetry group G is anomalous or not. The basic idea is to gauge the symmetry and expose the anomaly as an obstruction to a consistent topological theory combining both the original anyons and the gauge fluxes.

While these are not models of interacting fermions, they may well capture the topological behavior of some strongly correlated systems. In this work, we give a full pedagogical treatment of a special simple case of these models, which we call the 3D semion model: We calculate its ground-state degeneracies for a variety of boundary conditions, and classify its low-lying excitations. While point defects in the bulk are confined in pairs connected by energetic strings, the surface excitations are more interesting: the model has deconfined point defects pinned to the boundary of the lattice, and these exhibit semionic braiding statistics. The surface physics is reminiscent of a \u03bd= 1 2 bosonic fractional quantum Hall effect in its topological limit, and these considerations \u2026",

We construct a set of exactly solvable models in 2 D and 3 D, which exhibit such subsystem SPT (SSPT) phases with one-dimensional subsystem symmetries. These phases exhibit analogs of phenomena seen in SPTs protected by global symmetries: gapless edge modes, projective realizations of the symmetries at the edge, and nonlocal order parameters.
