Broadband harmonic radiation is first generated by focusing an infrared laser with a carefully chosen intensity into a gas cell containing argon atoms. The emitted light then goes through a hard aperture and a thin aluminum filter that selects a 30-eV bandwidth around a 30-eV photon energy and synchronizes all of the components, thereby enabling the formation of a train of almost Fourier-transform-limited single-cycle 170 attosecond pulses. Our experiment demonstrates a practical method for synthesizing and controlling attosecond waveforms.",

The physics of their generation consists of an interplay between the microscopic laser\u2013atom interaction and macroscopic effects due to ionization and phase matching in the nonlinear medium. In this review, we focus on a complete understanding of the way in which attosecond pulses arrive at a target where they can be characterized and used in an experiment. We discuss a number of results from calculations of attosecond pulse generation obtained by simultaneous solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Maxwell wave equation. These results, which allow for a clean separation of microscopic and macroscopic factors, illustrate how macroscopic effects are used to select attosecond pulses from the radiation that is emitted by atoms \u2026",

            "We present a theoretical study of transient absorption and reshaping of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses by helium atoms dressed with a moderately strong infrared (IR) laser field. We formulate the atomic response using both the frequency-dependent absorption cross section and a time-frequency approach based on the time-dependent dipole induced by the light fields. The latter approach can be used in cases when an ultrafast dressing pulse induces transient effects, and\/or when the atom exchanges energy with multiple frequency components of the XUV field. We first characterize the dressed atom response by calculating the frequency-dependent absorption cross section for XUV energies between 20 and 24 eV for several dressing wavelengths between 400 and 2000 nm and intensities up to 10 12 W\/cm 2. We find that for dressing wavelengths near 1600 nm, there is an Autler-Townes splitting of the 1 s\u2192 2 p \u2026",
