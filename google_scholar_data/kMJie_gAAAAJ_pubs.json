            "The dynamics of pigment-pigment and pigment-protein interactions in light-harvesting complexes is studied with an approach that combines molecular dynamics simulations with quantum chemistry calculations and a polaron model analysis. The molecular dynamics simulation of light-harvesting (LH) complexes was performed on an 87 055 atom system comprised of a LH-II complex of Rhodospirillum molischianum embedded in a lipid bilayer and surrounded with appropriate water layers. For each of the 16 B850 bacteriochlorophylls (BChls), we performed 400 ab initio quantum chemistry calculations on geometries that emerged from the molecular dynamical simulations, determining the fluctuations of pigment excitation energies as a function of time. From the results of these calculations we construct a time-dependent Hamiltonian of the B850 exciton system from which we determine within linear response theory \u2026",

Such trajectories that transiently violate the second law of thermodynamics are crucial for the validity of JE. As a solution to this daunting problem, we propose a simple and efficient method, referred to as the FR method, for calculating simultaneously both the PMF U(z) and the corresponding diffusion coefficient D(z) along a reaction coordinate z for a classical many-particle system by employing a small number of fast SMD pullings in both forward (F) and time reverse (R) directions, without invoking JE.

The classical approach to generate tissues\/organs is by seeding and expanding cells in appropriately shaped biocompatible scaffolds, in the hope that the maturation process will result in the desired structure. To accomplish this goal more naturally and efficiently, we set up and implemented a novel TE method that is based on principles of developmental biology and employs bioprinting, the automated delivery of cellular composites into a three\u2010dimensional (3D) biocompatible \u2026",

            "Channel proteins that selectively conduct molecules across cell membranes often exhibit an asymmetric structure. By means of a stochastic model, we argue that channel asymmetry in the presence of nonequilibrium fluctuations, fueled by the cell\u2019s metabolism as observed recently, can dramatically influence the transport through such channels by a ratchetlike mechanism. For an aquaglyceroporin that conducts water and glycerol, we show that a previously determined asymmetric glycerol potential leads to enhanced inward transport of glycerol, but for unfavorably high glycerol concentrations also to enhanced outward transport that protects a cell against poisoning.",

            "In this paper we study the BCS Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover scenario within the superconducting state, using a T-matrix approach which yields the ground state proposed by Leggett. Here we extend this ground state analysis to finite temperatures T and interpret the resulting physics. We find two types of bosoniclike excitations of the system: long lived, incoherent pair excitations and collective modes of the superconducting order parameter, which have different dynamics. Using a gauge invariant formalism, this paper addresses their contrasting behavior as a function of T and superconducting coupling constant g. At a more physical level, our paper emphasizes how, at finite T, BCS-BEC approaches introduce an important parameter \u0394 pg 2= \u0394 2\u2212 \u0394 sc 2 into the description of superconductivity. This parameter is governed by the pair excitations and is associated with particle-hole asymmetry effects \u2026",
