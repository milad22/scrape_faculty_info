            "Downloaded from a series of examples, from which the rules could be deduced, they received a 24-question multiple-choice test isomorphic to the questions they answered during the learning phase. In all conditions of this experiment (as well as the other experiments reported here), participants successfully learned the material with no differences in learning scores (F3, 68< 1) or learning times (F3, 68< 1.5). However, there were significant differences in transfer (see experiment 1, in the figure above). Participants in the Generic 1 condition performed markedly higher than participants in each of the three concrete conditions (F3, 68= 11.9, P< 0.001; post hoc Tukey\u2019s test, P values< 0.002). Furthermore, transfer in the Generic 1 condition was above chance (t> 7, P< 0.005), whereas transfer in the concrete conditions did not reliably exceed chance (t values< 1.7, P values> 0.35; t= 2.8, P= 0.06 for Concrete 3). These results indicate that learning one, two, or three concrete instantiations resulted in little or no transfer, whereas learning one generic instantiation resulted in significant transfer. If transfer from multiple instantiations depends on whether the learner abstracts and aligns the common structure from the learned instantiations (1, 4), then transfer failure suggests that participants may have been unable to recognize and align the underlying structure. In two additional experiments, we assisted structural alignment. In experiment 2, 20 participants learned Concrete A and Concrete B instantiations and were given the alignment of analogous elements across the learning instantiations. To our surprise, this assistance yielded no improvement in transfer \u2026",

            "A goal of successful learning is the transfer of learned knowledge to novel situations. However, spontaneous transfer is notoriously difficult to achieve. In this research, we argue that learning and transfer can be facilitated when knowledge is expressed in an abstract, generic form. In Experiments 1 and 2, undergraduate students learned two isomorphic domains, which were based on the same algebraic group, with one domain expressed in a more abstract, generic form and the other expressed in a more concrete form. In both experiments, transfer from more abstract to more concrete was greater than the reverse. In Experiment 3, undergraduate students learned the same algebraic group under varying degrees of concreteness. Our results demonstrate that the use of perceptually rich, concrete symbols may hinder learning. This research indicates that concreteness may have substantial learning and \u2026",

Within the framework of the standard model of particle physics there are small corrections, in sum about 1%, due to slight heating of neutrinos by electron-positron annihilations and finite-temperature QED effects. We show that this leads to changes in the predicted CMB anisotropies that will bias determination of the other cosmological parameters if not correctly taken into account.

            " Mathematical concepts are often difficult to acquire. This difficulty is evidenced by failure of knowledge to transfer to novel analogous situations. One approach to this challenge is to present the learner with a concrete instantiation of the to\u2010be\u2010learned concept. Concrete instantiations communicate more information than their abstract, generic counterparts and, in doing so, they may facilitate initial learning. However, this article argues that extraneous information in concrete instantiations may distract the learner from the relevant mathematical structure and, as a result, hinder transfer. At the same time, generic instantiations, such as traditional mathematical notation, can be learned by both children and adults and can, in turn, allow for transfer, suggesting that generic instantiations result in a portable knowledge representation.",

We find that, for a wide range of parameter space, the bubble walls of the phase transition slow down by as much as a few orders of magnitude. Consequently, we also show that since baryon production can be a sensitive function of bubble wall velocity, it is important to include the effects of reheating in the calculation of the baryon density of the Universe. We show that there is a sensitive velocity dependence for all mechanisms of baryon production, depending on the magnitude of velocity of the bubble wall, and we examine in particular an inverse velocity dependence on baryon production, which is predicted by the charge transport mechanism of baryon \u2026",

            "We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the extent to which prompting the construction of a force diagram affects student solutions to simple mechanics problems. A total of 891 university introductory physics students were given typical force and motion problems under one of the two conditions: when a force diagram was or was not prompted as part of the solution. Results indicated that students who were prompted to draw the force diagram were less likely to obtain a correct solution than those who were not prompted to solve the problem in any particular way. Analysis of the solution methods revealed that those students prompted to use a diagram tended to use the formally taught problem\u2010solving method, and those students not prompted to draw a force diagram tended to use more intuitive methods. Students who were prompted to draw diagrams were also more likely to depict incorrect forces. These \u2026",

            "Most theories of analogical transfer focus on similarities between the learning and transfer domains, where transfer is more likely between domains that share common surface features, similar elements, or common interpretations of structure. We suggest that characteristics of the learning instantiation alone can give rise to different levels of transfer. We propose that concreteness of the learning instantiation can hinder analogical transfer of well-defined structured concepts, such as mathematical concepts. We operationalize the term concreteness as the amount of information communicated through a specific instantiation of a concept. The 5 reported experiments with undergraduate students tested the hypothesis by presenting participants with the concept of a commutative mathematical group of order 3. The experiments varied the level of concreteness of the training instantiation and measured transfer of learning to \u2026",
