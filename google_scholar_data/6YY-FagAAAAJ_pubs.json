            "Magnetic separations at very low magnetic field gradients (<100 tesla per meter) can now be applied to diverse problems, such as point-of-use water purification and the simultaneous separation of complex mixtures. High\u2013surface area and monodisperse magnetite (Fe3O4) nanocrystals (NCs) were shown to respond to low fields in a size-dependent fashion. The particles apparently do not act independently in the separation but rather reversibly aggregate through the resulting high-field gradients present at their surfaces. Using the high specific surface area of Fe3O4 NCs that were 12 nanometers in diameter, we reduced the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water by orders of magnitude. Additionally, the size dependence of magnetic separation permitted mixtures of 4- and 12-nanometer\u2013sized Fe3O4 NCs to be separated by the application of different magnetic fields.",

It may provide the opportunity to bring about modifications of the electronic and magnetic properties of materials through controlled and reversible changes of the carrier concentration without modifying the level of disorder, as occurs when chemical composition is altered. As well as providing a basis for new devices, electrostatic doping can in principle serve as a tool for studying quantum critical behavior, by permitting the ground state of a system to be tuned in a controlled fashion. In this paper progress in electrostatic doping of a number of materials systems is reviewed.

We detail the process statistics and the protocols used to infer the successful formation of a single-molecule transistor. At low temperatures each transistor acts as a single-electron device in the Coulomb blockade regime. Resonances in the differential conductance indicate vibrational excitations consistent with a known mode of C60. In several devices we observe conductance features characteristic of the Kondo effect, a coherent many-body state comprising an unpaired spin on the molecule coupled by exchange to the conduction electrons of the leads. The inferred Kondo temperature typically exceeds 50 K, and signatures of the vibrational modes persist into the Kondo regime. ",

In contrast, here we demonstrate resistive switches and memories that use SiOx as the sole active material and can be implemented in entirely metal-free embodiments. Through cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, we determine that the switching takes place through the voltage-driven formation and modification of silicon (Si) nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in the SiOx matrix, with SiOx itself also serving as the source of the formation of this Si pathway. The small sizes of the Si NCs (d \u223c 5 nm) suggest that scaling to ultrasmall domains could be feasible. Meanwhile, the switch also shows robust nonvolatile properties, high ON\/OFF ratios (>105), fast switching (sub-100-ns), and good endurance (104 write-erase cycles). These \u2026",
