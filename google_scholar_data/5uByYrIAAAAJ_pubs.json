However, this exponential arises not from gauge interactions but from the background metric (which is a slice of AdS 5 spacetime). We demonstrate a simple explicit example of this mechanism with two 3-branes, one of which contains the standard model fields. The phenomenology of these models is new and dramatic. None of the current constraints on theories with very large extra dimensions apply.",

This framework is phenomenologically very attractive; it introduces new possibilities for solving the supersymmetric flavor problem, the gaugino mass problem, the supersymmetric CP problem, and the \u03bc-problem. Furthermore, the compactification scale can be consistent with a unification of gauge and \u2026",

Two important effects are emphasized. First, non-renormalizable terms in the superpotential can lift standard model flat directions at large field values. Second, the finite energy density in the early universe induces soft potentials with curvature of order the Hubble constant. Both these have important implications for baryogenesis, which requires large squark or slepton expectation values to develop along flat directions. In particular, the induced mass squared must be negative. The resulting baryon to entropy ratio is very insensitive to the details of the couplings and initial conditions, but depends on the dimension of the non-renormalizable operator in the superpotential which stabilizes the flat direction and the reheat temperature \u2026",

Such constraints disappear in the presence of a stablizing potential, and the ordinary Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations are reproduced, with the expansion driven by the sum of the physical values of the energy densities on the two branes and in the bulk.

A class of low-energy effective supersymmetric theories is derived from four assumptions: minimal field content, R-parity conservation, absence of quadratic divergences, and naturalness of near-flavor conservation. Current experiments are testing and constraining this wide class of supersymmetric models, and not just a specific N= 1 supergravity model.",

            "A treatment of linearized gravity is given in the Randall-Sundrum background. The graviton propagator is found in terms of the scalar propagator, for which an explicit integral expression is provided. This reduces to the four-dimensional propagator at long distances along the brane, and provides estimates of subleading corrections. Asymptotics of the propagator off the brane yields exponential falloff of gravitational fields due to matter on the brane. This implies that black holes bound to the brane have a``pancake''-like shape in the extra dimension, and indicates validity of a perturbative treatment off the brane. Some connections with the AdS\/CFT correspondence are described.",
