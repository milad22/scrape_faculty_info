In the present study of 134 formula-fed and 63 breast-fed infants, we prospectively evaluated whether providing a source of DHA and AA or DHA alone in formula would increase red blood cell (RBC) phospholipid levels of these fatty acids, enhance visual function, or affect growth during the first year. Healthy term infants< 7 d old were randomized to be fed formulas containing linoleic acid (\u2248 10% kcal) and\u03b1-linolenic acid (\u2248 1% kcal) plus (1) no added LCP fatty acids (control formula),(2) DHA (0.12 wt% fatty acids) and AA (0.43 wt%) from egg yolk phospholipid (AA+ DHA formula), or (3) DHA (0.2 wt%) from fish oil (DHA formula).

Their importance in infant nutrition was recognized by the rapid accretion of these fatty acids in the brain during the first postnatal year, reports of enhanced intellectual development in breastfed children, and recognition of the physiologic importance of DHA in visual and neural systems from studies in animal models. These considerations led to clinical trials to evaluate whether infant formulas that are supplemented with DHA or both DHA and ARA would enhance visual and cognitive development or whether conversion of linoleic acid and \u03b1-linolenic acid, the essential fatty acid precursors of ARA and DHA, respectively, at the levels found in infant formulas is sufficient to support adequately visual and cognitive development.

Three hundred twenty-three (18.2 percent) of the radiographs revealed mineralization in these areas which varied from an apparent elongation of the styloid process to extensive involvement of the entire ligament complex with segmentation, nodularity, and the development of jointlike structures. Mineralization was unilateral in 12.4 percent of patients and was observed more commonly in patients 50 to 59 years of age. No relationship could be established between the extent of mineralization and increasing patient age. This study suggests that mineralization of the stylohyoid complex is not uncommon and probably only rarely causes symptoms.",

            "Anti-B4-blocked Ricin (Anti-B4-bR) is an immunotoxin comprised of the anti-B4 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and the protein toxin \u201cblocked ricin.\u201d The anti-B4 MoAb is directed against the B-lineage-restricted CD19 antigen expressed on more than 95% of normal and neoplastic B cells. Blocked ricin is an altered ricin derivative that has its nonspecific binding eliminated by chemically blocking the galactose binding domains of the B chain. In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrate that the IC37 of Anti-B4-bR is 2 x 10(-11) mol\/L compared with 4 x 10(-12) mol\/L for native ricin. A phase I dose escalation clinical trial was conducted in 25 patients with refractory B-cell malignancies. Anti-B4-bR was administered by daily 1-hour bolus infusion for 5 consecutive days at doses ranging from 1 microgram\/kg\/d to 60 micrograms\/kg\/d. Serum levels above 1 nmol\/L were achieved transiently in the majority of patients treated at \u2026",

            "Purpose: This phase I trial was undertaken to deter-mine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the B-cell-restricted immunotoxin anti-B4-blocked ricin (anti-B4-bR) when it is administered by 7-day continuous infusion.Patients and Methods: Thirty-four patients with re-lapsed and refractory B-cell neoplasms (26 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], four chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], four acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) received 7-day continuous infusion anti-B4-bR. Successive cohorts of at least three patients were treated at doses of 10 to 70 ig\/kg\/d for 7 days with the dose increased by 10 sg\/kg\/d for each cohort. The initial three cohorts of patients (10, 20, and 30, sg\/kg\/d X 7 days) also received a bolus infusion of 20 ag\/kg before beginning the continuous infusion.Results: The MTD was reached at 50 Ag\/kg\/d X 7 days. The DLTs were National Cancer Institute Common",
