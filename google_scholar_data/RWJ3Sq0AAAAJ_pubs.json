The critical temperature for the binodal increased approximately linearly with salt concentration. The coexisting liquid phases both remained supersaturated but differed widely in protein concentration. No salt repartitioning was observed between the initial and the two separated liquid phases. After the L\u2013L separation, due to the presence of the high protein concentration phase, crystallization occurred much more rapidly than in the initial solution. At high initial protein concentrations, a metastable gel phase formed at temperatures above the liquid binodal. Both crystal nucleation and gel formation were accelerated in samples that had \u2026",

The Rayleigh ratio R\u03b8 and the collective diffusion coefficient Dc were determined as function of both protein concentration cp and salt concentration cs with two different salts. At low salt concentrations, the scattering ratio Kcp\/R\u03b8 and diffusivity increased with protein concentration above the values for a monomeric, ideal solution. With increasing salt concentration this trend was eventually reversed. The hydrodynamic interactions of lysozyme in solution, extracted from the combination of static and dynamic scattering data, decreased significantly with increasing salt concentration. These observations reflect changes in protein interactions, in response to increased salt screening, from net repulsion to net attraction.

            "Recently, much progress has been made in understanding the nucleation and crystallization of globular proteins, including the formation of compositional and structural crystal defects. Insight into the interactions of (screened) protein macro-ions in solution, obtained from light scattering, small angle X-ray scattering and osmotic pressure studies, can guide the search for crystallization conditions. These studies show that the nucleation of globular proteins is governed by the same principles as that of small molecules. However, failure to account for direct and indirect (hydrodynamic) protein interactions in the solutions results in unrealistic aggregation scenarios. Microscopic studies of numerous proteins reveal that crystals grow by the attachment of growth units through the same layer-spreading mechanisms as inorganic crystals.

FK506 binding protein 51 kDa (FKBP51, encoded by FKBP5) forms a mature chaperone complex with Hsp90 that prevents tau degradation. In this study, we have shown that tau levels are reduced throughout the brains of Fkbp5\u2013\/\u2013 mice. Recombinant FKBP51 and Hsp90 synergized to block tau clearance through the proteasome, resulting in tau oligomerization. Overexpression of FKBP51 in a tau transgenic mouse model revealed that FKBP51 preserved the species of tau that have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis, blocked amyloid formation, and decreased tangle load in the brain. Alterations in tau turnover and aggregate structure corresponded with enhanced neurotoxicity in mice. In human brains, FKBP51 levels increased relative to age and AD, corresponding with \u2026",

Effects of temperature gradients and crystal orientation are analyzed in detail. The experiments utilized numerical interpolation techniques previously employed by Dougherty and Gollub to enhance the digital image resolution.

From these values, the selection parameter \u03c3 theor* predicted by microscopic solvability theory for the three-dimensional axisymmetric case was computed and compared to the \u03c3 expt* values determined directly from previous dendritic-growth experiments. We find that \u03c3 theor*\/\u03c3 expt* is 0.56\u00b10.20 for SCN, and 2.14\u00b10.50 for PVA. Possible sources for these discrepancies are discussed.",

            "Formation of large protein fibrils with a characteristic cross \u03b2-sheet architecture is the key indicator for a wide variety of systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases. Recent experiments have strongly implicated oligomeric intermediates, transiently formed during fibril assembly, as critical contributors to cellular toxicity in amyloid diseases. At the same time, amyloid fibril assembly can proceed along different assembly pathways that might or might not involve such oligomeric intermediates. Elucidating the mechanisms that determine whether fibril formation proceeds along non-oligomeric or oligomeric pathways, therefore, is important not just for understanding amyloid fibril assembly at the molecular level but also for developing new targets for intervening with fibril formation. We have investigated fibril formation by hen egg white lysozyme, an enzyme for which human variants underlie non-neuropathic amyloidosis. Using a combination of static and dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy and circular dichroism, we find that amyloidogenic lysozyme monomers switch between three different assembly pathways: from monomeric to oligomeric fibril assembly and, eventually, disordered precipitation as the ionic strength of the solution increases. Fibril assembly only occurred under conditions of net repulsion among the amyloidogenic monomers while net attraction caused precipitation. The transition from monomeric to oligomeric fibril assembly, in turn, occurred as salt-mediated charge screening reduced repulsion among individual charged residues on the same monomer. We suggest a model of amyloid fibril formation in which \u2026",

            "We report that caffeine, in millimolar concentrations, interacts strongly with four common calcium indicator dyes: mag-fura-2, magnesium green, fura-2, and fluo-3. Fluorescence intensities are either noticeably enhanced (mag-fura-2, fura-2) or diminished (magnesium green, fluo-3). The caffeine-induced changes in the fluorescence spectra are clearly distinct from those of metal ion binding at the indicator chelation sites. Binding affinities for calcium of either mag-fura-2 or magnesium green increased only slightly in the presence of caffeine. Caffeine also alters the fluorescence intensities of two other fluorescent dyes lacking a chelation site, fluorescein and sulforhodamine 101, implicating the fluorophore itself as the interaction site for caffeine. In the absence of caffeine, variation of solution hydrophobicity by means of water\/dioxane mixtures yielded results similar to those for caffeine. These observations suggest that \u2026",
