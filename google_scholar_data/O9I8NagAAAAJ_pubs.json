We evaluate the integrals numerically in order to test directly the Anastasiou-Bern-Dixon-Kosower\/Bern-Dixon-Smirnov all-loop ansatz for planar MHV amplitudes. We find that the ansatz requires an additive remainder function, in accord with previous indications from strong-coupling and Regge limits. The planar six-gluon amplitude can also be compared with the hexagonal Wilson loop computed by Drummond, Henn, Korchemsky, and Sokatchev in arXiv: 0803.1466. After accounting for differing singularities and other constants independent of the kinematics, we find that the Wilson loop and MHV-amplitude remainders are identical, to within our numerical precision.
