We use this observation to design a hybridization assay based on color changes associated with gold aggregation. Because the underlying adsorption mechanism is electrostatic, no covalent functionalization of the gold, the probe, or the target DNA is required. Hybridization conditions can be optimized because it is completely separated from the detection step. The assay is complete within 5 min, and <100 femtomoles of target produces color changes observable without instrumentation. Single-base-pair mismatches are easily detected.",

After ss-DNA adsorbs on Au-nps, we find that the particles are stabilized against salt-induced aggregation. These observations can be rationalized on the basis of electrostatics and form the basis for a colorimetric assay to identify specific sequences and single nucleotide polymorphisms on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA. The assay is label-free, requires no covalent modification of the DNA or Au-np surfaces, and takes on the sensitivity of PCR. Most important, binding of target and probe takes place in solution where hybridization occurs in less than 1 min. As an example, we test PCR-amplified genomic DNA from clinical samples for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a fatal arrhythmia known \u2026",

Devices based on poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) prepared with these materials exhibited a 30-fold improvement in stability and, in one case, dramatically lower (10 volts versus about 30 volts) operating voltage relative to those having conventional ET layers. The current-carrying capacity of indium tin oxide-PPV-polymeric ET layer-aluminum LEDs was also increased by a factor of 30.

            "We report steady-state and transient optical characterization of phenylenevinylene polymers and extract a picture of the photoexcitations and dynamics which may apply more generally to nondegenerate ground-state conjugated polymers. The most common excitation pathway involves formation of nonemissive interchain excitons, unless the polymer chains are separated so that intrachain excitons responsible for photoluminescence are formed preferentially. Oxidation defects can be introduced thermally or photochemically and lead to charge transfer quenching of intrachain excitons whose dynamics can be understood quantitatively. We have identified the defect site, quantified concentrations at which it becomes problematic and shown that we can essentially eliminate it with improved synthesis. The maximum electroluminescence efficiency is not simply related to the photoluminescence quantum yield \u03a6PL and \u2026",

            "We report measurements of photoluminescence from films of a soluble phenylenevinylene polymer that has prospective importance as the emissive material in light-emitting diodes. We show unambiguously that there is long-lived emission in this material due to excimers and estimate that the quantum yield for excimer formation is as high as 50%. Since excimers in this polymer largely decay nonradiatively at ambient temperature, their prominence serves to drastically reduce the possible efficiency of electroluminescent conjugated polymer devices.
