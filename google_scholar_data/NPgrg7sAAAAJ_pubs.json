The measured gas flow exceeds predictions of the Knudsen diffusion model by more than an order of magnitude. The measured water flow exceeds values calculated from continuum hydrodynamics models by more than three orders of magnitude and is comparable to flow rates extrapolated from molecular dynamics simulations. The gas and water permeabilities of these nanotube-based membranes are several orders of magnitude higher than those of commercial polycarbonate membranes, despite having pore sizes an order of magnitude smaller. These membranes enable fundamental studies of mass transport in confined environments, as well as more energy-efficient nanoscale filtration.",

A force microscope has been used to measure the adhesive and friction forces between molecularly modified probe tips and organic monolayers terminating in a lithographically defined pattern of distinct functional groups. The adhesive interactions between simple CH3\/CH3, CH3\/COOH, and COOH\/COOH functional groups correlate directly with friction images of sample surfaces patterned with these groups. Thus, by monitoring the friction between a specifically functionalized tip and sample, one can produce friction images that display predictable contrast and correspond to the spatial distribution of functional groups on the sample surface. Applications of this chemically sensitive imaging technique are discussed.",

Modification of force microscope probe tips by covalent linking of organic monolayers that terminate in well-defined functional groups enables direct probing of molecular interactions and imaging with chemical sensitivity. This new chemical force microscopy technique has been used to probe adhesion and frictional forces between distinct chemical groups in organic and aqueous solvents. Contact mechanics provide a framework to model the adhesive forces and to estimate the number of interacting molecular groups. In general, measured adhesive and frictional forces follow trends expected from the strengths of the molecular interactions, although solvation also plays an important role \u2026",

            "Chemical force microscopy (CFM) was used to probe interactions between ionizable and neutral functional groups in aqueous solutions. Force microscope probe tips and sample substrates have been covalently modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) terminating in distinct functional groups. SAMs were prepared by treating Au-coated or uncoated tips and substrates with functionalized thiols or silanes, respectively. A force microscope has been used to characterize adhesive and frictional interactions between probe tips and substrates modified with SAMs that terminate in \u2212NH2, \u2212COOH, \u2212OH, and \u2212CH3 functional groups as a function of solution pH and ionic strength. In general, adhesion and friction forces were observed to depend on the chemical identity of the tip and sample surface and also were found to be highly sensitive to the changes in the ionization state of the terminal functionalities induced \u2026",

            "Nanoscience encompasses all scientific phenomena that transpire in dimensions spanning the range of multiple atom clusters, molecular aggregates, supermolecular structures, polymers and biomolecules. In other words, nanoscience is the science of the nanoscale\u2014or the very, very minute. Nanotechnology, the technological use of these properties and phenomena, has the potential to revolutionize a breathtaking range of fields, across practically all domains of human activity. The intense interest in using nanostructures stems from the promise that they boast superior electrical, optical, mechanical, chemical, or biochemical properties. There is little doubt that the use of these new materials and systems will lay the ground for the new technological revolution of the 21st century. Research in nanoscience is exploding as scientists from chemistry, physics, and biology, including colloid and polymer chemistry, materials and surface science, and biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology have begun to examine the superior properties that characterize materials and phenomena at the nanoscale. The Dekker Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology is a vehicle by which scientists and the interested public can explore the most recent developments in today's nanomaterials, and preview several of their foreseen applications of tomorrow. The subject areas of this five-volume collective work include, but are not limited to, chemistry, physics, molecular and quantum biology, materials science and engineering, and computer science. The topics include fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, quantum dots and inorganic nanowires, interfacial \u2026",
