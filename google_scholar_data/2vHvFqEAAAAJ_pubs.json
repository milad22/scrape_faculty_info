            "For centuries, practitioners of origami (\u2018ori\u2019, fold;\u2018kami\u2019, paper) and kirigami (\u2018kiru\u2019, cut) have fashioned sheets of paper into beautiful and complex three-dimensional structures. Both techniques are scalable, and scientists and engineers are adapting them to different two-dimensional starting materials to create structures from the macro-to the microscale 1, 2. Here we show that graphene 3, 4, 5, 6 is well suited for kirigami, allowing us to build robust microscale structures with tunable mechanical properties. The material parameter crucial for kirigami is the F\u00f6ppl\u2013von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n number 7, 8 \u03b3: an indication of the ratio between in-plane stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, with high numbers corresponding to membranes that more easily bend and crumple than they stretch and shear. To determine \u03b3, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene monolayers that are 10\u2013100 micrometres in size and obtain a value \u2026",

Here, we present evidence that near three-quarters (34) filling of the conduction miniband, these enhanced interactions drive the twisted bilayer graphene into a ferromagnetic state. In a narrow density range around an apparent insulating state at 34, we observe emergent ferromagnetic hysteresis, with a giant anomalous Hall (AH) effect as large as 10.4 kilohms and indications of chiral edge states. Notably, the magnetization of the sample can be reversed by applying a small direct current. Although the AH resistance is not quantized, and dissipation is present, our measurements suggest that the system may be an incipient Chern insulator.",

We demonstrate the synchronization of two dissimilar silicon nitride micromechanical oscillators, that are spaced apart by a few hundred nanometers and are coupled through an optical cavity radiation field. The tunability of the optical coupling between the oscillators enables one to externally control the dynamics and switch between coupled and individual oscillation states.

Using a mean-field approach to describe fluctuations, we analytically calculate Q and frequency shifts in tensioned and buckled carbon nanotubes and find excellent agreement with simulations.",

            "This paper investigates the influence of magneto-centrifugally driven or simply magnetic winds of rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized T Tauri stars in causing the inward or outward migration of close-in giant planets. The azimuthal ram pressure of the magnetized wind acting on the planet tends to increase the planet's angular momentum and cause outward migration if the star's rotation period P* is less than the planet's orbital period Pp. In the opposite case, P* > Pp, the planet migrates inward. Thus, planets orbiting at distances larger (smaller) than 0.06 au (P*\/5 d)2\/3 tend to be pushed outward (inward), where P* is the rotation period of the star assumed to have the mass of the Sun. The magnetic winds are likely to occur in T Tauri stars where the thermal speed of the gas close to the star is small, where the star's magnetic field is strong, and where the star rotates rapidly.

This has allowed development and study of solid-state electron-optical devices such as beam splitters and quantum point contacts, which have informed our understanding of electron flow and interactions. Recently, high-mobility graphene has emerged as an ideal two-dimensional semimetal that hosts unique chiral electron-optical effects due to its honeycomb crystalline lattice. However, this chiral transport prevents the simple use of electrostatic gates to define electron-optical devices in graphene. Here we present a method of creating highly collimated electron beams in graphene based on collinear pairs of slits, with absorptive sidewalls between the slits. By this method, we achieve beams with angular width 18 or narrower, and transmission matching classical ballistic predictions.",
