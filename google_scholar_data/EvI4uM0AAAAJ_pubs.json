We find that the experimentally observed GMR energies of the Sn isotopes are lower than the values predicted by theoretical calculations that reproduce the GMR energies in Pb 208 and Zr 90 very well.

Early speculations of possible exotic states of matter focused on the nstruphysicnl imylications of abnormal states of dense nuclear matter. 1 Subsequent field theoretical calculations, assuming chiral symmetry in the o model, resulted in predictions of abnormal nuclear states and excitation of the vacuum. 2 This generated an interest in particle nnd nuclear physics to transform the state of the vacuum by using relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. 3 Shortly thereafter, a phase transition to a system of deconfined quarks and gluons, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), 4 was predicted.

The band has sixteen transitions with an average energy spacing of 36 keV and an average dynamic moment of inertia scrI (2) of 112 \u0127 2 MeV\u2212 1. This band persists to rather low rotational frequency (\u0127\u03c9\u223c 0.125 MeV) and is proposed to extend in spin from 10+ to 42+. No transitions linking the superdeformed states and the low deformation yrast levels were found and the decay out of the superdeformed band appears to be statistical. This is the second case of superdeformation in the A\u223c 190 region.",

            "We have investigated the isoscalar giant resonances in the Sn isotopes using inelastic scattering of 386-MeV \u03b1 particles at extremely forward angles, including 0. We have obtained completely \u201cbackground-free\u201d inelastic-scattering spectra for the Sn isotopes over the angular range 0\u20139 and up to an excitation energy of 31.5 MeV. The strength distributions for various multipoles were extracted by a multipole decomposition analysis based on the expected angular distributions of the respective multipoles. We find that the centroid energies of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) in the Sn isotopes are significantly lower than the theoretical predictions. In addition, based on the ISGMR results, a value of K \u03c4=\u2212 550\u00b1100 MeV is obtained for the asymmetry term in the nuclear incompressibility. Constraints on interactions employed in nuclear structure calculations are discussed on the basis of the experimentally \u2026",
