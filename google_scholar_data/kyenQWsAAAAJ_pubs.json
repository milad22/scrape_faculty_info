            "We investigate the details of the bulk-boundary correspondence in Lorentzian signature anti\u2013de Sitter space. Operators in the boundary theory couple to sources identified with the boundary values of non-normalizable bulk modes. Such modes do not fluctuate and provide classical backgrounds on which bulk excitations propagate. Normalizable modes in the bulk arise as a set of saddlepoints of the action for a fixed boundary condition. They fluctuate and describe the Hilbert space of physical states. We provide an explicit, complete set of both types of modes for free scalar fields in global and Poincar\u00e9 coordinates. For AdS 3, the normalizable and non-normalizable modes originate in the possible representations of the isometry group SL (2, R) L\u00d7 SL (2, R) R for a field of given mass. We discuss the group properties of mode solutions in both global and Poincar\u00e9 coordinates and their relation to different expansions \u2026",

We conjecture that these give rise to (generically non-supersymmetric) conformal theories.

In phenomenologically attractive Ho\u0159ava-Witten compactifications, the effects are much larger but still unobservable.

            "Free scalar fields in de Sitter space have a one-parameter family of states invariant under the de Sitter group, including the standard thermal vacuum. We show that, except for the thermal vacuum, these states are unphysical when gravitational interactions are included. We apply these observations to the quantum state of the inflaton, and find that at best, dramatic fine tuning is required for states other than the thermal vacuum to lead to observable features in the CMBR anisotropy.",

            "The AdS\/CFT conjecture relates quantum gravity on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on the spacetime boundary. We interpret the CFT in terms of natural analogues of the bulk S-matrix. Our first approach finds the bulk S-matrix as a limit of scattering from an AdS bubble immersed in a space admitting asymptotic states. Next, we show how the periodicity of geodesics obstructs a standard LSZ prescription for scattering within global AdS. To avoid this subtlety we partition global AdS into patches within which CFT correlators reconstruct transition amplitudes of AdS states. Finally, we use the AdS\/CFT duality to propose a large N collective field theory that describes local, perturbative supergravity. Failure of locality in quantum gravity should be related to the difference between the collective 1\/N expansion and genuine finite N dynamics.",
