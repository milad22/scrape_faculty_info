            "Cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) focuses on understanding the interactions between matter and the electromagnetic field in cavities at the quantum level 1, 2. In the past years, CQED has attracted attention 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 especially owing to its importance for the field of quantum information 10. At present, photons are the best carriers of quantum information between physically separated sites 11, 12 and quantum-information processing using stationary qubits 10 is most promising, with the furthest advances having been made with trapped ions 13, 14, 15. The implementation of complex quantum-information-processing networks 11, 12 hence requires devices to efficiently couple photons and stationary qubits. Here, we present the first CQED experiments demonstrating that the collective strong-coupling regime 2 can be reached in the interaction between a solid in the form of an ion Coulomb crystal 16 and \u2026",

The experiment uses a cold, trap-based positron beam and the technique of studying positron scattering in a strong magnetic field. In O 2, a feature previously seen in the total ionization cross section is observed in both the positronium formation and total ionization cross sections. The possible origin of this feature and its relationship to positron-induced dissociation is discussed. In N 2, the near-threshold electronic excitation cross section is larger than that for positronium formation. This likely explains the relatively high efficiency of this molecule \u2026",

To this end, a reasonably complete set of cross sections for low energy positron scattering in argon has been used to calculate transport coefficients of low energy positrons in pure argon gas subject to an electrostatic field. We have analyzed the main features of these coefficients and have compared the calculated values with those for electrons in the same gas. The particular focus is on the influence of the non-conservative nature of positronium formation. This effect is substantial, generally speaking much larger than any comparable effects in electron transport due to attachment and\/or ionization. As a result several new phenomena have been observed, such as negative differential conductivity (NDC) in \u2026",

The technique relies on the selective adjustment of the load capacitance of the trap electrodes, achieved through the addition of capacitors to the basic resonant rf circuit used to drive the trap. Displacements of up to~ 100 \u00b5m with micrometer precision are measured using a combination of fluorescence images of ion Coulomb crystals and coherent coupling of such crystals to a mode of an optical cavity. The displacements are made without measurable distortion of the shape or structure of the Coulomb crystals, as well as without introducing excess heating commonly associated with the radial displacement of crystals by adjustment through static potentials. We expect this technique to be of importance for future developments of microtrap architectures and ion-based cavity \u2026",
