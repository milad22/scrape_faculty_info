We believe that these carcinogens have in common a ring system sufficiently planar for a stacking interaction with DNA base pairs and a part of the molecule capable of being metabolized to a reactive group: these structural features are discussed in terms of the theory of frameshift mutagenesis. We propose that these carcinogens, and many others that are mutagens, cause cancer by somatic mutation. A simple, inexpensive, and extremely sensitive test for detection of carcinogens as mutagens is described. It consists of the use of a rat or human liver homogenate for carcinogen activation (thus supplying mammalian metabolism) and a set of Salmonella histidine mutants for mutagen detection. The \u2026",

The lipopolysaccharide that normally coats these bacteria is a barrier to penetration of mutagens to the cell membrane. The set of tester strains has been improved by adding a mutation (rfa: deep rough) that results in a deficient lipopolysaccharide. The techniques for using these strains for detecting mutagens are presented and the tests are shown to be extremely sensitive and convenient. The specificity of frameshift mutagenesis is clarified. As adjuncts to the test with the four strains, we describe a test that compares mutagenic killing in deep rough strains with and without DNA excision repair, and a test using forward mutagenesis in a deep rough strain lacking excision repair.",

Adenovirus 5 host range mutants were previously isolated by their ability to replicate in the adenovirus 5-transformed human embryonic cell line 293 and by their inability to replicate efficiently in HeLa cells (Harrison, Graham and Williams, 1977). The group I complementation class of host range mutants has been mapped by marker rescue between 0 and 4.4 units (Frost and Williams, 1978).
