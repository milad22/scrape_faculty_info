The resulting multilayered nanostructures, prepared with different combinations of the substrate, SAM, and nanoparticles, are studied with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. Under certain circumstances, the SPR sensitivity of the bare metal is considerably enhanced by the presence of the metal particles. Both the occurrence and the degree of this effect depend strongly on the choice of the combination of materials in the multilayered system. The substrate\/SAM\/nanoparticles systems that exhibit the enhanced SPR sensitivity include Au\/AET\/Au, Au\/HDT\/Au, Au\/AET\/Ag, and Ag\/AET\/Ag. On the other hand, the effects of the nanoparticles are \u2026",

We have studied the adsorption characteristics of the intermediate reactants of this multistep reaction on a gold film electrode in alkaline solutions by combining surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements with Fourier transform electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (FT-EIS). Methanol oxidation in this system shows no significant effects of \u201csite poisoning\u201d by chemisorbed CO. Our results suggest that OH\u2212 chemisorbed onto Au acts as a stabilizing agent for the surface species of electro-active methanol. Double layer charging\/discharging and adsorption\/desorption of OH\u2212 show more pronounced effects than adsorption\/oxidation of methanol in controlling the surface charge density of the Au substrate. These effects are manifested in both the EIS and the SPR data, and serve as key indicators of the surface reaction \u2026",

In this report, we examine the mechanism of this enhancement and discuss the experimental factors that are crucial to the performance of such a nanoparticle based SPR device. Among these factors, the surface plasmon-supporting metal substrate plays a major role. We demonstrate this by comparing experimental SPR data for Au and Ag substrates. In both cases, \u223c25\u221230 nm diameter Au particles are attached to the substrate metal via a sandwiched monolayer of 1,6-hexanedithiol. The width and the efficiency of SPR for both substrates are affected by the Au particles. However, the particle-induced shift in the SPR angle is observed only for the Au substrate. This observation is explained in terms of competitive effects of propagating \u2026",
