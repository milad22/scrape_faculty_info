            "Ethnography is one of the principal methods of qualitative research and has a long-established tradition of use in the social sciences. However, the literature on ethnography has become a battleground as ethnography is attacked from within and without the qualitative tradition. Post-modern critics attack the methodological status of ethnography and challenge the importance of its representations of reality, and others argue that globalization narrows its application as localism disappears. This volume provides a robust defence of this research method and establishes its continued relevance in the social sciences. It sets out the competing methodological bases of ethnography and details its different uses as a research method. The author offers guidelines for good practice in the research process, as well as advice on the analysis, interpretation and presentation of ethnographic data.",

            "Discourse analysis is the name given to a variety of different approaches to the study of texts, which have developed from different theoretical traditions and diverse disciplinary locations. Strictly speaking, there is no single'discourse analysis', but many different styles of analysis that all lay claim to the name. What these perspectives share is a rejection of the realist notion that language is simply a neutral means of reflecting or describing the world, and a conviction in the central importance of discourse in constructing social life. This chapter will discuss one approach to discourse analysis that has been influential in fields as diverse as the sociology of science, media studies, technology studies, social psychology and policy analysis. The chapter is divided into four broad sections. In the first, I consider the intellectual context of the development of discourse analysis, and set out its central tenets. Secondly, I discuss the practice of discourse analysis. The third section is a case study of the use of this approach to analyse a short passage of text from a newspaper article. It gives an indication of the kind of material generated by discourse analysis, and fleshes out readers' understanding of doing discourse analysis. Finally the chapter will offer an evaluation of discourse analysis, highlighting some of its advantages and disadvantages.",

            "This book is a reappraisal of English politics in the first decade of George III's reign. It sets out to explain how party politics changed, and what problems that created for the parliamentary elite. The issues of party, of patriotism as it manifested itself in the elder Pitt's political career, and of the relations between the notions of ministerial responsibility and the powers of the Crown are all used to illuminate the nature of political conflict. Special emphasis is placed on Burke's notions of party. The schisms created by this reconfiguration of party politics, Dr Brewer argues, had effects beyond Westminster. He discusses extra-parliamentary forms of political expression, notably the press, and goes on to show how the career of John Wilkes and the critique of British politics developed by American radicals gave focus to a variety of political discontents, and produced new arguments in favour of parliamentary reform. Throughout his study he emphasises the interplay between popular and parliamentary politics. His work is designed to show that the'political nation'included many other than the parliamentary classes, and that the political conflicts of the period cannot be properly understood without a full examination of political ideology.",
