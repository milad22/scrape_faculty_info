In these samples the competition between PMA and shape anisotropy leads to the formation of highly ordered striped domain patterns with a magnetization component perpendicular to the film plane. These striped domains give rise to magnetic satellite peaks in the diffraction pattern. Magnetic diffraction rod scans of these satellites were analyzed to obtain information about the magnetic depth profile of the films. It was found that flux closure occurs in samples with a low to medium PMA, while a high PMA impedes the formation of closure domains. Data analysis gives a depth of the closure domains extending to 85 \u00c5, with approximately half the magnetic moment aligned in plane.",
