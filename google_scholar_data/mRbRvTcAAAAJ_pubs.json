            "A broad class of disordered materials including foams, glassy molecular systems, colloids and granular materials can form jammed states. A jammed system can resist small stresses without deforming irreversibly, whereas unjammed systems flow under any applied stresses. The broad applicability of the Liu\u2013Nagel jamming concept 1, 2 has attracted intensive theoretical and modelling interest but has prompted less experimental effort 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In the Liu\u2013Nagel framework, jammed states of athermal systems exist only above a certain critical density. Although numerical simulations for particles that do not experience friction broadly support this idea 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, the nature of the jamming transition for frictional grains is less clear 14, 15, 16, 17. Here we show that jamming of frictional, disk-shaped grains can be induced by the application of shear stress at densities lower than the critical value, at which \u2026",

This ensemble, which is based on the conservation properties of the stress tensor, is distinct from the original Edwards ensemble and applies to packings of deformable grains. We combine it with a field theoretical analysis of the packings, where the field is the Airy stress function derived from the force and torque balance conditions.
