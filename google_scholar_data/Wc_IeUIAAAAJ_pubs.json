            "The Lhasa Terrane in southern Tibet has long been accepted as the last geological block accreted to Eurasia before its collision with the northward drifting Indian continent in the Cenozoic, but its lithospheric architecture, drift and growth histories and the nature of its northern suture with Eurasia via the Qiangtang Terrane remain enigmatic. Using zircon in situ U\u2013Pb and Lu\u2013Hf isotopic and bulk-rock geochemical data of Mesozoic\u2013Early Tertiary magmatic rocks sampled along four north\u2013south traverses across the Lhasa Terrane, we show that the Lhasa Terrane has ancient basement rocks of Proterozoic and Archean ages (up to 2870 Ma) in its centre with younger and juvenile crust (Phanerozoic) accreted towards its both northern and southern edges. This finding proves that the central Lhasa subterrane was once a microcontinent. This continent has survived from its long journey across the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean \u2026",

This paper reviews and reevaluates these hypotheses in light of new data from Tibet including (1) the distribution of major tectonic boundaries and suture zones, (2) basement rocks and their sedimentary covers, (3) magmatic suites, and (4) detrital zircon constraints from Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks. The Western Qiangtang, Amdo, and Tethyan Himalaya terranes have the Indian Gondwana origin, whereas the Lhasa Terrane shows an Australian Gondwana affinity.

These results offer new insights into the pre-Cenozoic geology and tectonomagmatic evolution of the Lhasa Terrane, and provide boundary conditions for the origin and evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. Our new data, together with data from the literature indicate that the Early Cretaceous magmatism in the central Lhasa subterrane lasted for a long period (~ 143\u2013102 Ma) with a magmatic flare-up at ~ 110 Ma. The latter is accompanied by mafic magmatism in this terrane.

The ca. 1170 Ma detrital zircons in the Lhasa terrane were most likely derived from the Albany-Fraser belt in southwest Australia, whereas the ca. 950 Ma detrital zircons from both the western Qiangtang and Tethyan Himalaya terranes might have been sourced from the High Himalaya to the south.

New SHRIMP zircon dating for a dacite coupled with previous SHRIMP zircon dating for a mafic dike and fossil constraints for the sedimentary sequence indicate that Yeba volcanic rocks were emplaced in the Early Jurassic (174-190 Ma). Yeba tholeiitic mafic rocks possess compositional diversity and are divided into three groups based on concentrations of MgO, Al2O3, and La.

            "This paper reports new zircon LA-ICP-MS U\u2013Pb age and Hf-isotope, whole-rock major and trace element, and Sr\u2013Nd isotope data from Cambrian metavolcanic rocks in the central Lhasa subterrane of southern Tibet. These rocks form a bimodal volcanic suite consisting mainly of silicic metavolcanic rocks with subordinate metabasalts. Five silicic metavolcanic samples dated at ca. 492 Ma and one metabasalt sample yielding a near-concordant 206Pb\/238U age of 492 \u00b1 4 Ma indicate that mafic and silicic eruptions were contemporaneous. The metabasalts are mostly high-K calc-alkaline, enriched in Th, U, and light rare earth elements (LREEs), and depleted in Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, and Hf, geochemically resembling the Andean arc basalts. The silicic metavolcanic rocks are high-K calc-alkaline and low in Nb and Zr. The metabasaltic rocks have negative whole-rock \u03b5Nd(t) values (\u2212 4.7 to \u2212 3.5) and varying zircon \u03b5Hf(t \u2026",
