Two spatially overlapped and time-sequenced laser pulses were used to observe directly the excited-state absorption (ESA) and the two-step photoionization of the cerium ions. The peak cross section of the ESA transition is (1.0\u00b10.3)\u00d7 10\u2212 17 cm 2 at 700 nm. The ESA spectrum was measured from 600 to 880 nm and is used to construct an energy-level diagram for the Ce 3+ ions relative to the energy-band states of the Y 3 Al 5 O 12 host. The energy gap between the lowest relaxed 5d state and the conduction-band edge is estimated to be 10 000 cm\u2212 1. Strong-probe saturation measurements indicate a slow and inefficient back-transfer of excitation to the cerium ions following the ESA.

In its simplest form, an optical imaging procedure would involve illuminating the part of the body to be imaged with bright light and to search for indication of pathology in the observed transillumination pattern. The physical basis of transillumination is the difference in the transmission of light through normal tissue and an object inside it. This differential transmission, in principle, should lead to the formation of a \u201cshadow\u201d of the tumor in transmitted light. However, a biological tissue absorbs and strongly scatters the light that passes through it. The scattered light severely degrades the quality of the shadow image, and for thick tissues, may wash it out. The key to the successful development of optical imaging techniques is to deal effectively with the problem of light \u2026",
