            "We determine the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies in the core of the Coma cluster for M_R<=-11.4 (assuming H_0= 75 km\/s\/Mpc), a magnitude regime previously explored only in the Local Group. Objects are counted in a deep CCD image of Coma having RMS noise of 27.7 R mag~ arcsec . A correction for objects in the foreground or background of the Coma cluster---and the uncertainty in this correction---are determined from images of five other high-latitude fields, carefully matched to the Coma image in both resolution and noise level. Accurate counts of Coma cluster members are obtained as faint as R= 25.5, or M_R=-9.4. The LF for galaxies is well fit by a power law dN\/dL\\propto L^\\alpha, with\\alpha=-1.42\\pm0. 05, over the range-19.4< M_R<-11.4; faintward of this range, the galaxies are unresolved and indistinguishable from globular clusters, but the data are consistent with an extrapolation of the power law. Surface brightness biases are minimized since galaxies are not subjected to morphological selection, and the limiting detection isophote is 27.6 R mag~ arcsec . We find the typical  Coma cluster galaxy to have an exponential scale length ~ pc, similar to Local Group galaxies of comparable magnitude. These extreme dwarf galaxies show a surface density increasing towards the giant elliptical NGC~ 4874 as , similar to the diffuse light and globular cluster distributions. The luminosity in the detected dwarf galaxies is at most a few percent of the total diffuse light of the giant galaxies in the cluster, and the contribution of the dwarfs to the mass of the cluster is likely negligible as well.",

From these data a more detailed picture of the gamma radiation from this source has been developed, showing several characteristics that distinguish this pulsar: the light curve is complex; there is no detectable unpulsed emission; the energy spectrum is flat, with no evidence of a sharp high-energy cutoff up to greater than 4 GeV. Comparisons of the gamma-ray data with observations at longer wavelengths show that no two of the known gamma-ray pulsars have quite the same characteristics; this diversity makes interpretation in terms of theoretical models difficult.",

            "The Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment OSSE on the COMPTON Gamma Ray Observatory has observed SN1987A for two 2-week periods during the first nine months of the mission. Evidence for gamma-ray line and continuum emission from 57Co is observed with an intensity of about 10exp-4 gamma-sq cm sexp-1. This photon flux between 50 and 136 keV is demonstrated by Monte Carlo calculations to be independent of the radial distribution of the 57Co for models of low optical depth viz., models having photoelectric absorption losses of 122 keV photons no greater than several percent. For such models the observed 57Co flux indicates that the ratio of 57Ni56Ni produced in the explosion was about 1.5 times the solar system ratio of 57Fe56Fe. When compared with nearly contemporaneous bolometric estimates of the luminosity for SN1987A, our observations imply that 57Co radioactivity does not account for most of the current luminosity of the supernova remnant in low-optical-depth models. We suggest alternatives including a large-optical-depth model that is able to provide the SN1987A luminosity and is consistent with the OSSE flux. It requires a 5756 production ratio of about twice solar.Descriptors:",
