            "Directly monitoring atomic motion during a molecular transformation with atomic-scale spatio-temporal resolution is a frontier of ultrafast optical science and physical chemistry. Here we provide the foundation for a new imaging method, fixed-angle broadband laser-induced electron scattering, based on structural retrieval by direct one-dimensional Fourier transform of a photoelectron energy distribution observed along the polarization direction of an intense ultrafast light pulse. The approach exploits the scattering of a broadband wave packet created by strong-field tunnel ionization to self-interrogate the molecular structure with picometre spatial resolution and bond specificity. With its inherent femtosecond resolution, combining our technique with molecular alignment can, in principle, provide the basis for time-resolved tomography for multi-dimensional transient structural determination.",

            "High-harmonic generation from gases produces attosecond bursts and enables high-harmonic spectroscopy to explore electron dynamics in atoms and molecules. Recently, high-harmonic generation from solids has been reported, resulting in novel phenomena and unique control of the emission, absent in gas-phase media. Here we investigate high harmonics from semiconductors with controllable induced photo-carrier densities, as well as the driving wavelengths. We demonstrate that the dominant generation mechanism can be identified by monitoring the variation of the harmonic spectra with the carrier density. Moreover, the harmonic spectral dependence on the driving wavelength is reported and a different dependence from the well-known one in gas-phase media is observed. Our study provides distinct control of the harmonic process from semiconductors, sheds light on the underlying mechanism and \u2026",

High and low spatial frequency LIPSS (HSFL and LSFL, respectively) were observed for both s- and p-polarized light. The measured LSFL period for p-polarized light was consistent with the currently established LIPSS origination model of coupling between surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and the incident laser pulses. A vector model of SPP coupling is introduced to explain the formation of s-polarized LSFL away from the center of the damage spot. Additionally, a new method is proposed to determine the SPP propagation length from the decay in ripple depth. This is used along with the measured LSFL period to estimate the average electron density and Drude collision time of the laser-excited surface. Finally, full-wave \u2026",

The period of these structures varied from \u03bb\/3 to \u03bb\/8.

Our understanding of fs-LIDA, however, is limited mostly to visible and near-infrared wavelengths. In this work, we systematically study single-shot, fs-laser ablation (fs-LIA) of single-crystal germanium from near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, and compare the fs-LIA wavelength scaling with two widely used models. We show that these models are inadequate, particularly at mid-infrared wavelengths. Instead, a hybrid model is proposed involving Keldysh ionization rates, a constant free-carrier density threshold, and multi-band effects, which yields good agreement with experimental observations. Aspects of this model may be applied to understanding other strong-field non-perturbative phenomena in solids.",

We compare our results to numerical simulations based on two mechanisms: cascade three-wave mixing and non-perturbative harmonic generation, both of which include quasi-phase matching. The cascade model reproduces well the general features of the observed spectrum, including a plateau-like harmonic distribution and the observed efficiency.
