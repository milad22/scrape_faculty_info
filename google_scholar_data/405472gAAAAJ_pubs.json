            "In November-December 2007 a widespread seabird mortality event occurred in Monterey Bay, California, USA, coincident with a massive red tide caused by the dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea. Affected birds had a slimy yellow-green material on their feathers, which were saturated with water, and they were severely hypothermic. We determined that foam containing surfactant-like proteins, derived from organic matter of the red tide, coated their feathers and neutralized natural water repellency and insulation. No evidence of exposure to petroleum or other oils or biotoxins were found. This is the first documented case of its kind, but previous similar events may have gone undetected. The frequency and amplitude of red tides have increased in Monterey Bay since 2004, suggesting that impacts on wintering marine birds may continue or increase.",

            "To sharpen the search for new lipoxygenase inhibitors, we designed a screen to probe for both potency and selectivity. The assay utilized 12-human (12-HLO), 15-human (15-HLO), and 15-soybean (15-SLO) lipoxygenases. The IC50 value data obtained provided new insights about structure\u2212activity relationships (SAR) for redox and nonredox inhibitors. All of the compounds tested were isolated from sponges and consisted of a novel terpenoid, hyrtenone A (1), and 12 known terpenoids. Potent compounds were defined as those having IC50 values < 1 \u03bcM, and selectivity was assessed from the three possible IC50 value ratios. One of the four terpenoid redox inhibitors studied, puupehenone (2), was equivalent to or better in potency than the well-known redox inhibitor nordihydroguarierate acid (NDGA, 14). However, none of the terpene redox inhibitors exhibited a selectivity ratio on a par with that of 14. Several \u2026",

This fact emphasizes the need for discovering selective hLO inhibitors for both understanding the role of specific lipoxygenases in the cell and developing pharmaceutical therapeutics. To this end, we have modified a known lipoxygenase assay for high-throughput (HTP) screening of both the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the UC Santa Cruz marine extract library (UCSC-MEL) in search of platelet-type 12-hLO (12-hLO) selective inhibitors. The HTP screen led to the characterization of five novel 12-hLO inhibitors from the NCI repository. One is the potent but non-selective michellamine B, a natural product, anti-viral agent. The other four compounds were selective inhibitors against 12-hLO, with three being synthetic compounds and one being \u03b1 \u2026",
