            "We investigate the properties of chiral operators in N = 2 superconformal theories. In particular, we study the spectral flow of such models under a one-parameter family of twists generated by the U(1) current, and use this to deduce various properties of the ring of chiral primary fields. We furthermore investigate under what conditions a given superconformal theory can be represented as the fixed point of an N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg theory and show how to determine the superpotential. We also investigate the coset models of Kazama and Suzuki and find a simple cohomological characterization for the elements of the chiral primary ring. Moreover we show how some of them can be represented as LG models.",

            "We obtain first order equations that determine a supersymmetric kink solution in five-dimensional N= 8 gauged supergravity. The kink interpolates between an exterior anti-de Sitter region with maximal supersymmetry and an interior anti-de Sitter region with one quarter of the maximal supersymmetry. One eighth of supersymmetry is preserved by the kink as a whole. We interpret it as describing the renormalization group flow in N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory broken to an N= 1 theory by the addition of a mass term for one of the three adjoint chiral superfields. A detailed correspondence is obtained between fields of bulk supergravity in the interior anti-de Sitter region and composite operators of the infrared field theory. We also point out that the truncation used to find the reduced symmetry critical point can be extended to obtain a new N= 4 gauged supergravity theory holographically dual to a sector of N= 2 gauge theories based on quiver diagrams.We consider more general kink geometries and construct a c-function that is positive and monotonic if a weak energy condition holds in the bulk gravity theory. For even-dimensional boundaries, the c-function coincides with the trace anomaly coefficients of the holographically related field theory in limits where conformal invariance is recovered.",

The 3-branes that give rise to BPS multiplets in the string descend to self-dual strings on the Riemann surface, with tension determined by a canonically fixed Seiberg-Witten differential \u03bb. This gives, effectively, a dual formulation of Yang-Mills theory in which gauge bosons and monopoles are treated on equal footing, and represents the rigid analog of type II\/heterotic string duality. The existence of BPS states is essentially reduced to a geodesic problem on the Riemann surface with metric| \u03bb| 2. This allows us, in particular, to easily determine the spectrum of stable BPS states in field theory. Moreover, we identify the six-dimensional space R 4\u00d7 \u03c3 as the world-volume of a five-brane and show that BPS states correspond \u2026",
