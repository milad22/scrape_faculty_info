The Kamioka liquid scintillator antineutrino detector (KamLAND) has the sensitivity to detect electron antineutrinos produced by the decay of 238 U and 232 Th within the Earth. Earth composition models suggest that the radiogenic power from these isotope decays is 16 TW, approximately half of the total measured heat dissipation rate from the Earth. Here we present results from a search for geoneutrinos with KamLAND. Assuming a Th\/U mass concentration ratio of 3.9, the 90 per cent confidence interval for the total number of geoneutrinos detected is 4.5 to 54.2. This result is consistent with the central value of 19 predicted by geophysical models.

The KamLAND data set includes data acquired following a radiopurity upgrade and amounts to a total exposure of 3.49\u00d7 10 32 target-proton-year. Under the assumption of C P T invariance, a two-flavor analysis (\u03b8 13= 0) of the KamLAND and solar data yields the best-fit values tan\ufeff 2 \u03b8 12= 0.444\u2212 0.030+ 0.036 and \u0394 m 21 2= 7.50\u2212 0.20+ 0.19\u00d7 10\u2212 5 eV 2; a three-flavor analysis with \u03b8 13 as a free parameter yields the best-fit values tan\ufeff 2 \u03b8 12= 0.452\u2212 0.033+ 0.035, \u0394 m 21 2= 7.50\u2212 0.20+ 0.19\u00d7 10\u2212 5 eV 2, and sin\ufeff 2 \u03b8 13= 0.020\u2212 0.016+ 0.016. This \u03b8 13 interval is consistent with other recent work combining the CHOOZ, atmospheric and long-baseline accelerator experiments. We also present a new global \u03b8 13 analysis, incorporating the CHOOZ, atmospheric, and \u2026",

            "The recent long-term shutdown of Japanese nuclear reactors has resulted in a significantly reduced reactor \u03bd e flux at KamLAND. This running condition provides a unique opportunity to confirm and constrain backgrounds for the reactor \u03bd e oscillation analysis. The data set also has improved sensitivity for other \u03bd e signals, in particular \u03bd e\u2019s produced in \u03b2-decays from U 238 and Th 232 within the Earth\u2019s interior, whose energy spectrum overlaps with that of reactor \u03bd e\u2019s. Including constraints on \u03b8 13 from accelerator and short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments, a combined three-flavor analysis of solar and KamLAND data gives fit values for the oscillation parameters of tan\ufeff 2 \u03b8 12= 0.436\u2212 0.025+ 0.029, \u0394 m 21 2= 7.53\u2212 0.18+ 0.18\u00d7 10\u2212 5 eV 2, and sin\ufeff 2 \u03b8 13= 0.023\u2212 0.002+ 0.002. Assuming a chondritic Th\/U mass ratio, we obtain 116\u2212 27+ 28 \u03bd e events from U 238 and Th 232, corresponding to a geo \u03bd e flux of \u2026",
