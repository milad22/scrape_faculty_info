            "This paper describes the adsorption of electroactive methylene blue (MB) dye onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to form an electrochemically functional nanostructure and its layered nanocomposite. UV\u2212visible and FT-IR spectroscopy and electrochemistry used for characterization of the MB adsorption onto SWNTs reveal that MB essentially interacts with SWNTs through charge-transfer and hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of a MB\u2212SWNT adsorptive nanostructure which exhibits distinct electrochemical properties from those of MB adsorbed onto a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The interactions between MB and the SWNTs are demonstrated to closely associate with the structural properties of the SWNTs by comparing the electrochemical properties of MB adsorbed onto different substrates, i.e., glassy carbon, SWNTs, and SWNTs intentionally sidewall functionalized with hydroxyl \u2026",

            "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been proved to be a novel type of nanostructure with unique structural, electronic and mechanical properties and have drawn extensive attention since their discovery. 1\u20133 Research over the past decade has revealed that the CNTs constitute a new form of carbon materials that are finding striking applications in many fields, such as energy conversion and storage, 4, 5 electromechanical actuators, 6, 7 chemical sensing8 and so forth. Generally, the nanotubes can be divided into two categories: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The former can be regarded as a graphene cylinder formed by rolling seamlessly a single graphene sheet along an (m, n) lattice vector in the sheet. The (m, n) indices is a central parameter governing the metallicity and chirality of the tubes. The latter is composed of coaxial multilayer graphene tubes with interlayer space of 0.34 nm. The diameter varies from 0.4 nm to 3 nm for the SWNTs and from 1.4 nm to 100 nm for the MWNTs (typical transmission electron microscopic images of the CNTs are shown in Fig. 1).Due to the unique physical and chemical properties and thus the striking applications in various research and industrial fields, the CNTs have drawn extensive interest over the past decade. To date, we have witnessed great successes in the synthesis of the CNTs and in understanding of their chemical and physical properties. Several excellent reviews concerning these issues have appeared in the literature. 9, 10 Currently, increasing interests are being focused on the construction of the CNT-based functional nanodevices \u2026",

Surfactant (i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) can interact with the MWNTs through hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic chain of SDS and the sidewall of the MWNTs. Such an interaction essentially leads to noncovalent adsorption of SDS onto the MWNTs, resulting in an enhanced solubilization of the MWNTs in distilled water and providing some negative charges on the tube surface. Both properties make it possible to assemble MWNT multi-layer films onto the ITO plate through an alternative adsorption of oppositely charged SDS-functionalized MWNTs \u2026",

Very different from the existing strategies for the development of electrochemical aptasensors with the aptamers as the probes, the strategy proposed here is essentially based on the utilization of the aptamer\u2212complementary DNA (cDNA) oligonucleotides as the probes for electrochemical sensing. In this context, the sequences at both ends of the cDNA are tailor-made to be complementary and both the redox moiety (i.e., ferrocene in this study) and thiol group are labeled onto the cDNA. The labeled cDNA are hybridized with their respective aptamers (i.e., ATP- and thrombin-binding aptamers in this study) to form double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) and the electrochemical aptasensors are prepared by self-assembling the labeled ds \u2026",

            "This study demonstrates a new kind of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)-based compartment-less glucose\/O2 biofuel cell (BFC) with glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD) as the anodic and cathodic biocatalysts, respectively, and with poly(brilliant creysl blue) (BCB) adsorbed onto SWNT nanocomposite as the electrocatalyst for the oxidation of NADH. The prepared GDH-polyBCB-SWNT bioanode exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose biofuel; in 0.10 M phosphate buffer containing 20 mM NAD+ and 100 mM glucose, the oxidation of glucose commences at \u22120.25 V and the current reaches its maximum of 310 \u03bcA\/cm2 at \u22120.05 V vs. Ag\/AgCl. At the BOD-SWNT biocathode, a high potential output is achieved for the reduction of O2 due to the direct electron transfer property of BOD at the SWNTs. In 0.10 M phosphate buffer, the electrocatalytic reduction \u2026",
