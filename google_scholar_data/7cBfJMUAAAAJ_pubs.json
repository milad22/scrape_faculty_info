The results indicate that contact thermal resistance increased dramatically at the die-attached interfaces with aging time and stress, degrading the luminous flux. The junction temperature and thermal uniformity of the flip-chip structure both strongly depend on the arrangement of gold bumps. Local hot spots effectively reduce light output under high electric and thermal stress, influencing the long-term performance of the LED device. The results were validated using finite element analysis and in experiments using an infrared and an emission microscope. A two-step thermal transient degradation mode was identified under various aging stresses. A simulation further optimized the bump configuration that was \u2026",

The fabrication of the photonic crystal on silicon was realized by the processes of electron-beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching. It was found that the hexagonal array of circular columns and rods has an optimal full photonic band gap. In addition, we show that a larger extraction of light from our designed photonic crystal can be obtained when compared with the frequently used photonic crystals reported previously.

The reliability and long lifetime of solid state lighting are especially essential in the high temperature applications, such as street lighting and automotive lighting. Because of the characteristics of semiconductor, the electrical property of light-emitting diodes is varying with operating temperature. Then, the alternation of electrical property changes the heating power and operating temperature of light-emitting diodes. This is a mutual interaction between electrical property and operating temperature, until they reach the steady state. In this paper, we designed experiments and calculation to optimize the simulation of temperature distribution of light-emitting diode module.
