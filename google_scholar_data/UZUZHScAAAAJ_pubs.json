            "It is now 16 years since the first data release from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). This Early Data Release, or EDR, occurred in 2001 June (Stoughton et al. 2002). Since this time, annual data releases from SDSS have become part of the landscape of astronomy, populating databases used by thousands of astronomers worldwide (Raddick et al. 2014a, 2014b), and making the SDSS\u2019s 2.5 mSloan Foundation Telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) one of the most productive observatories in the world (Madrid & Macchetto 2009). This paper describes the 14th public data release from SDSS, or DR14, released on 2017 July 31. The SDSS has completed three phases and is currently in its fourth phase. SDSS-I and-II conducted a Legacy survey of galaxies and quasars (York et al. 2000), the SDSS-II Supernova Survey (Frieman et al. 2008; Sako et al. 2014), and conducted observations of stars for the \u2026",

The CXB has three distinct components: contributions from two Galactic collisional thermal plasmas at kT~ 0.27 and 0.07 keV and an extragalactic power law with a photon spectral index \u0393= 1.45\u00b10.02.

We use B and V band time-series imaging obtained at the WIYN 0.9 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to search for RRL in these objects. In our Segue 2 observations, we present a previously unknown fundamental mode (RRab) RRL star with a period of P ab= 0.748 days. With this measurement, we revisit the inverse correlation between lang P ab rang and lang [Fe\/H] rang established in the literature for Milky Way dwarf galaxies and their RRL.

            "The masses of supermassive black holes at the centres of local galaxies appear to be tightly correlated with the mass and velocity dispersions of their galactic hosts. However, the local Mbh\u2013Mstar relation inferred from dynamically measured inactive black holes is up to an order-of-magnitude higher than some estimates from active black holes, and recent work suggests that this discrepancy arises from selection bias on the sample of dynamical black hole mass measurements. In this work, we combine X-ray measurements of the mean black hole accretion luminosity as a function of stellar mass and redshift with empirical models of galaxy stellar mass growth, integrating over time to predict the evolving Mbh\u2013Mstar relation. The implied relation is nearly independent of redshift, indicating that stellar and black hole masses grow, on average, at similar rates. Matching the de-biased local Mbh\u2013Mstar relation \u2026",
