            "We propose a procedure for computing the boundary stress tensor associated with a gravitating system in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. Our definition is free of ambiguities encountered by previous attempts, and correctly reproduces the masses and angular momenta of various spacetimes. Via the AdS\/CFT correspondence, our classical result is interpretable as the expectation value of the stress tensor in a quantum conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the conformal anomalies in two and four dimensions are recovered. The two dimensional stress tensor transforms with a Schwarzian derivative and the expected central charge. We also find a nonzero ground state energy for global AdS5, and show that it exactly matches the Casimir energy of the dual   super Yang\u2013Mills theory on S 3\u00d7R.",

This is done by truncating the coupled particle-hole system to a small set of modes, that are plausibly the most significant ones, and quantizing the reduced system. In this way we find that the particles no longer move along geodesics, nor is the action along the rays zero for a massless particle. The radiation is no longer thermal, but is corrected in a definite way that we calculate. Our methods can be extended in a straightforward manner to discuss correlations in the radiation, or between incoming particles and the radiation.",

Operators in the boundary theory couple to sources identified with the boundary values of non-normalizable bulk modes. Such modes do not fluctuate and provide classical backgrounds on which bulk excitations propagate. Normalizable modes in the bulk arise as a set of saddlepoints of the action for a fixed boundary condition. They fluctuate and describe the Hilbert space of physical states. We provide an explicit, complete set of both types of modes for free scalar fields in global and Poincar\u00e9 coordinates. For AdS 3, the normalizable and non-normalizable modes originate in the possible representations of the isometry group SL (2, R) L\u00d7 SL (2, R) R for a field of given mass.

A notable result is that radiation which could leave the hole with mass and charge characteristic of a naked singularity, predicted in the usual approximation of fixed space-time geometry, is here suppressed.

            "In the AdS\/CFT correspondence one encounters theories that are not invariant under diffeomorphisms. In the boundary theory this is a gravitational anomaly, and can arise in 4k+ 2 dimensions. In the bulk, there can be gravitational Chern-Simons terms which vary by a total derivative. We work out the holographic stress tensor for such theories, and demonstrate agreement between the bulk and boundary. Anomalies lead to novel effects, such as a nonzero angular momentum for global AdS 3. In string theory such Chern-Simons terms are known with exact coefficients. The resulting anomalies, combined with symmetries, imply corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes that agree exactly with the microscopic counting.",
