            "Manipulating matter at the nanometre scale is important for many electronic, chemical and biological advances 1, 2, 3, but present solid-state fabrication methods do not reproducibly achieve dimensional control at the nanometre scale. Here we report a means of fashioning matter at these dimensions that uses low-energy ion beams and reveals surprising atomic transport phenomena that occur in a variety of materials and geometries. The method is implemented in a feedback-controlled sputtering system that provides fine control over ion beam exposure and sample temperature. We call the method \u201cion-beam sculpting\u201d, and apply it to the problem of fabricating a molecular-scale hole, or nanopore, in a thin insulating solid-state membrane. Such pores can serve to localize molecular-scale electrical junctions and switches 4, 5, 6 and function as masks 7 to create other small-scale structures. Nanopores also function \u2026",

Previous work with biological protein pores wide enough to let through and sense single-stranded DNA molecules demonstrates the power of using nanopores, but many future tasks and applications call for a robust solid-state pore whose nanometre-scale dimensions and properties may be selected, as one selects the lenses of a microscope. Here we demonstrate a solid-state nanopore microscope capable of observing individual molecules of double-stranded DNA and their folding behaviour. We discuss extensions of the nanopore microscope concept to alternative probing mechanisms and applications, including the study of molecular structure and sequencing.",

For a slitlike nanochannel of constant surface charge density, we predict that the maximum energy conversion efficiency occurs at low salt concentrations. An analytic expression for the regime of strong double-layer overlap reveals that the efficiency depends only on the ratio of the channel height to the Gouy\u2212Chapman length, and the product of the viscosity and the counterion mobility.

Slip is introduced by applying the Navier boundary condition to the pressure-driven and the electro-osmotic components of the fluid velocity. A strong enhancement in the efficiency is predicted for increasing slip length due to the resulting decrease in the fluidic impedance and increase in the streaming conductance. These effects are moderated by a decrease in the electrical impedance, which promotes dissipation. The maximum efficiency approaches 100% as the slip length diverges, and a potentially practical 40% efficiency is expected for a moderate 30 nm slip length in a 10 nm high channel. Recently reported slip lengths for carbon nanotube filters suggest that efficiencies above 70% and high \u2026",
