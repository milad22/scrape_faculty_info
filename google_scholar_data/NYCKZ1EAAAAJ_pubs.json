            "Knowledge of the properties of \u03b3-ray bursts has increased substantially following recent detections of counterparts at X-ray, optical and radio wavelengths. But the nature of the underlying physical mechanism that powers these sources remains unclear. In this context, an important question is the total energy in the burst, for which an accurate estimate of the distance is required. Possible host galaxies have been identified for the first two optical counterparts discovered, and a lower limit obtained for the redshift of one of them, indicating that the bursts lie at cosmological distances. A host galaxy of the third optically detected burst has now been identified and its redshift determined to be z= 3.42. When combined with the measured flux of \u03b3-rays from the burst, this large redshift implies an energy of 3\u00d7 10 53 erg in the \u03b3-rays alone, if the emission is isotropic. This is much larger than the energies hitherto considered, and it \u2026",

Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of nine new AGNs imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow us to create\" AGN-free\" images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the H\u03b2 time lag, which is assumed to yield the average H\u03b2 BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity.

This is the first known redshift and host of a short\u2010hard GRB and shows that at least some short\u2010hard GRBs are cosmological in origin. We began imaging the GRB field 8 minutes after the burst and continued for 8 days. We present a reanalysis of the XRT afterglow and report the absolute position of the GRB. Based on positional coincidences, the GRB and the elliptical are likely to be physically related, unlike any known connection between a long\u2010duration GRB and an early\u2010type galaxy. Similarly unique, GRB 050509b likely also originated from within a rich cluster of galaxies with detectable diffuse X\u2010ray emission.

SN 1999em is shown to be a Type II\u2010plateau (II\u2010P) event, with a photometric plateau lasting until about 100 days after explosion. We identify the dominant ions responsible for most of the absorption features seen in the optical portion of the spectrum during the plateau phase. Using the weakest unblended absorption features to estimate photospheric velocity, we find the distance to SN 1999em to be D= 8.2\u00b10.6 Mpc, with an explosion date of HJD 2,451,475.6\u00b11.4, or 5.3\u00b11.4 days before discovery. We show that this distance estimate is about 10% closer than the distance that results if the strong Fe ii \u03bb\u03bb4924, 5018, 5169 absorption features, which have often been used in previous EPM studies, are used to estimate \u2026",

            "We present a detailed study of line structure in early to late-time spectra of supernova (SN) 1993J. Spectra during the nebular phase, but within the first two years after explosion, exhibit small-scale structure in the emission lines of some species, notably oxygen and magnesium, showing that the ejecta of SN 1993J are clumpy. On the other hand, a lack of structure in emission lines of calcium implies that the source of calcium emission is uniformly distributed throughout the ejecta. These results are interpreted as evidence that oxygen emission originates in clumpy, newly synthesized material, while calcium emission arises from material preexisting in the atmosphere of the progenitor. Spectra spanning the range 433\u20132454 days after the explosion show boxlike profiles for the emission lines, clearly indicating circumstellar interaction in a roughly spherical shell. This is interpreted within the Chevalier & Fransson model \u2026",

            " We present optical spectropolarimetry obtained at the Keck II 10 m telescope on 1998 March 7 UT along with total flux spectra spanning the first 494 days after discovery (1998 March 2 UT) of the peculiar Type IIn supernova (SN) 1998S. The SN is found to exhibit a high degree of linear polarization, implying significant asphericity for its continuum\u2010scattering environment. Prior to the removal of interstellar polarization, the polarization spectrum is characterized by a flat continuum (at  ) with distinct changes in polarization associated with both the broad (symmetric, half\u2010width near zero intensity \u227310,000 km s\u22121) and narrow (unresolved, full width at half\u2010maximum less than 300 km s\u22121) line emission seen in the total flux spectrum. When analyzed in terms of a polarized continuum with unpolarized broad\u2010line recombination emission, an intrinsic continuum polarization of   results, suggesting a global asphericity of \u227345 \u2026",
