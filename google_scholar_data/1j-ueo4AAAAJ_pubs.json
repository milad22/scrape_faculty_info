            "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have the potential to \u201ctransform science education and give all students\u2026 the skills and knowledge they need to be informed citizens, college ready, and prepared for STEM careers\u201d(NSTA 2013). But as we open our arms to the NGSS, we also need to ask ourselves: How do we know if we are making the goals of the NGSS a reality for our students? How are we going to assess whether students know and can do what is described in the NGSS? Assessment occurs at many levels, including national (eg, National Assessment of Educational Progress), state, district, school, and classroom. At each of these levels, standardized assessments are important and affect decisions, policies, and practices in education. Change in standardized assessment is important for measuring and sustaining change in education (NRC 2012). The new standards provide both challenges \u2026",
