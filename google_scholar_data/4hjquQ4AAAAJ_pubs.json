            "The problem of gravitational fluctuations confined inside a finite cutoff at radius r= r c outside the horizon in a general class of black hole geometries is considered. Consistent boundary conditions at both the cutoff surface and the horizon are found and the resulting modes analyzed. For general cutoff r c the dispersion relation is shown at long wavelengths to be that of a linearized Navier-Stokes fluid living on the cutoff surface. A cutoff-dependent line-integral formula for the diffusion constant D (r c) is derived. The dependence on r c is interpreted as renormalization group (RG) flow in the fluid. Taking the cutoff to infinity in an asymptotically AdS context, the formula for D (\u221e) reproduces as a special case well-known results derived using AdS\/CFT. Taking the cutoff to the horizon, the effective speed of sound goes to infinity, the fluid becomes incompressible and the Navier-Stokes dispersion relation becomes exact. The \u2026",

A similar strategy allows us to derive a new Grassmannian integral for 3d ABJM theory amplitudes in momentum twistor space: it is a contour integral in an orthogonal Grassmannian with the novel property that the internal metric depends on the external data. The result can be viewed as a central step towards developing an amplituhedron formulation for ABJM amplitudes.

Therefore classically one might guess some information is trapped in the bulk and thus invisible at the boundary. We show that this classical intuition correctly predicts the quantum situation: whenever there are null geodesics which do not reach the boundary, there are also \u201ctrapped scalar modes\u201d whose boundary imprint is exponentially suppressed.
