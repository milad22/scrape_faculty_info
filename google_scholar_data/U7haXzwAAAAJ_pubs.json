Novel experimental methods are essential to explore the underlying biological mechanisms of cell response. We present a versatile method to culture cells on adhesive micro-patterned substrates while applying long-term cyclic tensile strain (CTS). A polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) mold is coated with a cell repulsive NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) hydrogel which in turn is covalently patterned by fibronectin using micro-contact printing. This results in two-dimensional, highly selective cell-adhesive micro-patterns. The substrates allow application of CTS to adherent cells for more than 4 days under cell culture conditions without unspecific adhesion. The applicability of our system is demonstrated by studying the adaptive response of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts seeded on fibronectin lines with different \u2026",

Mouse oocytes have no centrosomes, yet harbour centrally located nuclei. We demonstrate how oocytes define their geometric centre in the absence of centrosomes. Using live imaging of oocytes, knockout for the formin 2 actin nucleator, with off-centred nuclei, together with optical trapping and modelling, we discover an unprecedented mode of nucleus positioning. We document how active diffusion of actin-coated vesicles, driven by myosin Vb, generates a pressure gradient and a propulsion force sufficient to move the oocyte nucleus. It promotes fluidization of the cytoplasm, contributing to nucleus directional movement towards the centre. Our results highlight the potential of active diffusion, a prominent source of intracellular transport \u2026",

This process is mediated by complex assemblies of molecular motors and cytoskeletal filaments that drive force generation in the cytoplasm and facilitate enhanced motion.

Here, we study the active diffusion of vesicles in mouse oocytes, where this process plays a key role in nuclear positioning during development, and combine an experimental and theoretical framework to extract molecular-scale force kinetics (force, power stroke, and velocity) of the in vivo active process.

To this end, we investigate the active and passive transport of vesicles in Aplysia neurons while changing neurite tension via applied strain and quantify the resulting dynamics.
