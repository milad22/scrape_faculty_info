            "Ce doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Ce:YAG) is an important photonic material that is used as a yellow phosphor for white light emitting diodes. In this work, the physical and optical properties of Ce:YAG nanophosphors are investigated and the effects of high-temperature thermal treatments and annealing atmospheres on the particle size and luminescence intensity are discussed. Furthermore, photo-luminescence (PL) was measured as a function of temperature and compared with PL from Ce:YAG single crystals and transparent ceramics to understand the mechanism of luminescence decay with temperature. While the characteristics of PL emission as a function of temperature for single crystals and NPs are similar and follow common decay trends, Ce:YAG transparent ceramics exhibit an interesting unusual increase in PL with temperature. We explained this unique novel behavior by a 4-step mechanism \u2026",

            "Electronic defects with shallow and deep levels in \u03b2-Ga2O3 single crystals were investigated by thermoluminescence (TL) spectroscopy. Undoped, Fe-doped, Sn-doped, and Mg-doped \u03b2-Ga2O3 single crystals grown by different methods were studied, and thermal activation energies of defects were calculated using the initial rise method. Hall-effect measurements and optical absorption spectroscopy were performed to determine the electrical transport properties and optical bandgaps. It was found that the dopants do not have any effect on the bandgap energy, which is important for comparing the trap levels in the samples. Three deep trap levels were found in the undoped crystals; the activation energy, ED, and concentration of defect centers for all of them have slightly changed after doping with Fe and Mg. Fe doping induced an additional defect center with activation energy of 0.62\u2009eV. The measurements \u2026",

            "Transparent ceramics are emerging as future materials for lasers, scintillation, and illumination. In this paper, an interesting and surprising phenomenon in YAG transparent ceramics is reported. UV light leads to significant changes in the microstructure of open volume defects and nano clusters as well as in the optical properties. Light-induced lattice relaxation is suggested as the mechanism behind this intriguing behavior. The complex F-type color center with broad absorption bands is caused by the aliovalent sintering additives (Ca^2+\/Mg^2+) and Fe ion impurities. Two individual peaks in the thermoluminescence spectra illustrate both shallow and deep level traps. From positron annihilation lifetime data, vacancy clusters and nanovoids are detected and characterized, although these free-volume defects could not be observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.

X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the dependence of the film orientation on the substrate type and sintering method, and ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) absorption measurements revealed a band edge near 380 nm. van der Pauw technique was used to measure the resistivity of undoped ZnO and indium\/gallium-codoped ZnO (IGZO) films. IGZO films showed lower resistivity and larger average grain size compared with undoped ZnO films due to addition of In3+ and Ga3+, which act as donors.

In this study, thin films of TiO2 were deposited by pulsed laser deposition on sapphire and silicon substrates under various growth conditions, and characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical absorption spectroscopy and Hall-effect measurements. XRD patterns revealed that a sapphire substrate is more suitable for the formation of the rutile phase in TiO2, while a silicon substrate yields a pure anatase phase, even at high-temperature growth. AFM images showed that the rutile TiO2 films grown at 805\u00b0C on a sapphire substrate have a smoother surface than anatase films grown at 620\u00b0C. Optical absorption spectra confirmed the band gap energy of 3.08 eV for the rutile phase and 3.29 eV for the anatase phase. All the deposited films \u2026",

Expanding the nitride semiconductor family to include heterovalent ternary nitrides opens up new and exciting opportunities for device design that may help overcome some of the limitations of the binary nitrides. However, the more complex cation sublattice also gives rise to new interactions with both native point defects and defect complexes that can introduce disorder on the cation sublattice. Here, depth-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and surface photovoltage spectroscopy measurements of defect energy levels in ZnGeN2 combined with transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction reveal optical signatures of mid-gap states that can be associated with cation sublattice disorder.
