            "Recently a new, large family of two\u2010dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides and carbonitrides, called MXenes, was discovered. MXenes are produced by selective etching of the A element from the MAX phases, which are metallically conductive, layered solids connected by strong metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds, such as Ti2AlC, Ti3AlC2, and Ta4AlC3. MXenes combine the metallic conductivity of transition metal carbides with the hydrophilic nature of their hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces. In essence, they behave as \u201cconductive clays\u201d. This article reviews progress\u2014both experimental and theoretical\u2014on their synthesis, structure, properties, intercalation, delamination, and potential applications. MXenes are expected to be good candidates for a host of applications. They have already shown promising performance in electrochemical energy storage systems.

            "The intercalation of ions into layered compounds has long been exploited in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors. However, few host materials are known for ions much larger than lithium. We demonstrate the spontaneous intercalation of cations from aqueous salt solutions between two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 MXene layers. MXenes combine 2D conductive carbide layers with a hydrophilic, primarily hydroxyl-terminated surface. A variety of cations, including Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, and Al3+, can also be intercalated electrochemically, offering capacitance in excess of 300 farads per cubic centimeter (much higher than that of porous carbons). This study provides a basis for exploring a large family of 2D carbides and carbonitrides in electrochemical energy storage applications using single- and multivalent ions.",

Herein we report on the intercalation of two-dimensional Ti 3 C 2, Ti 3 CN and TiNbC\u2014so called MXenes. Intercalation of hydrazine, and its co-intercalation with N, N-dimethylformamide, resulted in increases of the c-lattice parameters of surface functionalized f-Ti 3 C 2, from 19.5 to 25.48 and 26.8 \u00c5, respectively. Urea is also intercalated into f-Ti 3 C 2. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a hydrazine monolayer intercalates between f-Ti 3 C 2 layers. Hydrazine is also intercalated into f-Ti 3 CN and f-TiNbC. When dimethyl sulphoxide is intercalated into f-Ti 3 C 2, followed by sonication in water, the f-Ti 3 C 2 is delaminated forming a stable colloidal solution that is in turn filtered to produce MXene \u2018paper\u2019.
