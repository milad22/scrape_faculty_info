Depending on the force applied and timecourse, in \u03b1L and \u03b1M I domains the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop moves successively between three ratchet positions; i.e. from closed to intermediate, and then to open. More distal, linked alterations in MIDAS loops and metal coordination closely resemble those seen when the MIDAS becomes ligated. Simulations show that the intermediate state is populated over a wider range of forces for \u03b1L than \u03b1M I domains. Simulations with mutant I domains suggest that specific ratchet residues regulate conformational equilibria. Simulations with \u03b11 and \u03b12 I domains reveal a lack of the intermediate conformation, owing to Phe to Glu substitution at the second ratchet residue \u2026",

            "The microscopic details of how peptides translocate one at a time through nanopores are crucial determinants for transport through membrane pores and important in developing nano-technologies. To date, the translocation process has been too fast relative to the resolution of the single molecule techniques that sought to detect its milestones. Using pH-tuned single-molecule electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how peptide passage through the \u03b1-hemolysin protein can be sufficiently slowed down to observe intermediate single-peptide sub-states associated to distinct structural milestones along the pore and how to control residence time, direction and the sequence of spatio-temporal state-to-state dynamics of a single peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations of peptide translocation reveal the time-dependent ordering of intermediate structures of the translocating peptide \u2026",
