            "The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed-matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity 1, 2. However, many properties of exotic, strongly correlated spin systems, such as spin liquids, have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N\u2248 30 particles 3. Feynman predicted that a quantum simulator\u2014a special-purpose \u2018analogue\u2019processor built using quantum bits (qubits)\u2014would be inherently suited to solving such problems 4, 5. In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, but simulations allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on two-or three-dimensional lattices of more than a few tens of qubits have yet to be \u2026",
