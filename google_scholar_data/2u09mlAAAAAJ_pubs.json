To fully exploit this potential requires simultaneous generation of multiple size droplets. We demonstrate two methods for passively breaking larger drops into precisely controlled daughter drops using pressure-driven flow in simple microfluidic configurations:(i) a T junction and (ii) flow past isolated obstacles. We quantify conditions for breakup at a T junction and illustrate sequential breakup at T junctions for making small drops at high dispersed phase volume fractions.",

In this paper, we review microfluidic methods for synthesizing uniform streams of droplets and bubbles, focusing on those that utilize pressure-driven flows. Three categories of microfluidic geometries are discussed, including co-flowing streams, cross-flowing streams, and flow focusing devices. In each category we summarize observations that have been reported to date in experiments and numerical simulations. We describe these results in the context of physical mechanisms for droplet breakup, and simple theoretical models that have been proposed. Applications of droplets in microfluidic devices are briefly reviewed.",

We examine the dependence of the transient diameter profile and the time to breakup on the molecular weight, and compare the observations with simple theories for breakup of slender viscoelastic filaments. The evolution of the transient diameter profile predicted by a multimode FENE-P model quantitatively matches the data provided the initial stresses in the filament are taken into account. Finally, we show how the transient uniaxial extensional viscosity of a dilute polymer solution can be estimated from the evolution in the diameter of the necking filament. The resulting \u201capparent extensional viscosity\u201d profiles are compared with similar results obtained from a filament stretching rheometer. Both \u2026",

By controlling the surfactant bulk concentration of a soluble nonionic surfactant in the neighborhood of the critical micelle concentration, along with the capillary number and the ratio of the internal and external flow rates, we observe several distinct modes of droplet breakup. For the most part, droplet breakup in microfluidic devices results in highly monodisperse droplets in the range of tens of micrometers in size. However, we observe a new mode of breakup called \u201cthread formation\u201d that resembles tipstreaming and yields tiny droplets in the range of a few micrometers in size or smaller. In this work, we characterize the growth of the thread and its maximum length as a function of flow variables and surfactant content, and we also characterize the period of droplet \u2026",

The range of conditions corresponds to the region in which both the squeezing pressure that arises when the emerging interface obstructs the channel and the viscous shear stress on the emerging interface strongly influence the process. In this regime, the droplet volume depends on the capillary number, the flow rate ratio, and the ratio of inlet channel widths, which controls the degree of confinement of the droplets. The viscosity ratio influences the droplet volume only when the viscosities are similar.
