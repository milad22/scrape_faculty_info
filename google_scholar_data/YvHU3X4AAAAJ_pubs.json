In simple metals the electrons show a free electron behaviour. The transverse phonons are softened but maintainn the \u03c93-density of states at low frequencies. The electron-phonon interaction does not conserve momentum due to the loss of translational invariance in the amorphous metal and yields a large contribution to \u03b12F(\u03c9) at low frequencies. Therefore the amorphous superconductors are strong coupling.

            "Ni, Co, and Fe films of a few atomic layers are condensed in UHV at 10 K on metallic substrates. Anomalous-Hall-effect measurements are used to determine the magnetization and the susceptibility of the films. Ni films with a thickness smaller than two atomic layers possess no magnetic moment but show an enhanced susceptibility. Between two and three atomic layers of Ni the susceptibility diverges and thicker films possess a magnetic moment. For Co and Fe, the first monolayers already shows a magnetic moment.",
