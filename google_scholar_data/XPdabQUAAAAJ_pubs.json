The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026",

DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4 m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion, the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterize dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large-scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae.

The new stellar systems are found by three independent automated search techniques and are identified as overdensities of stars, consistent with the isochrone and luminosity function of an old and metal-poor simple stellar population. The new systems are faint (M V>\u2212 4.7) and span a range of physical sizes (17< r 1\/2< 181) and heliocentric distances (25 kpc< D\u2299< 214 kpc). All of the new systems have central surface brightnesses consistent with known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (\u03bc gsim 27.5\u2212 2). Roughly half of the DES candidates are more distant, less luminous, and\/or have lower surface \u2026",

We constrain cosmological parameters in both the flat \u039b CDM and the w CDM models, while also varying the neutrino mass density. These results are shown to be robust using two independent shape catalogs, two independent photo-z calibration methods, and two independent analysis pipelines in a blind analysis. We find a 3.5% fractional uncertainty on \u03c3 8 (\u03a9 m\/0.3) 0.5= 0.78 2\u2212 0.027+ 0.027 at 68% CL, which is a factor of 2.5 improvement over the fractional constraining power of our DES Science Verification results. In w CDM, we find a 4.8% fractional uncertainty on \u03c3 8 (\u03a9 m\/0.3) 0.5= 0.77 7\u2212 0.038+ 0.036 and a dark energy equation-of-state w=\u2212 0.9 5\u2212 0.39+ 0.33.

Our sample of 45 stellar systems includes 28 kinematically confirmed dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and 17 recently discovered systems that have photometric characteristics consistent with the population of known dSphs. For each of these targets, the relative predicted \u03b3-ray flux due to dark matter annihilation is taken from kinematic analysis if available, and estimated from a distance-based scaling relation otherwise, assuming that the stellar systems are DM-dominated dSphs. LAT data coincident with four of the newly discovered targets show a slight preference (each  2\u03c3 local) for \u03b3-ray emission in excess of the background. However, the ensemble of derived \u03b3-ray flux upper limits for individual targets is \u2026",
