Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the binary neutron star event GW170817 at t< 160 days after merger. These observations show that GW170817 has been steadily brightening with time and might have now reached its peak, and constrain the emission process as non-thermal synchrotron emission where the cooling frequency \u03bd c is above the X-ray band and the synchrotron frequency \u03bd m is below the radio band. The very simple power-law spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons  accelerated by a shock launched by a neutron star (NS)\u2013NS merger to date. We find p= 2.17\u00b10.01, which indicates that radiation from ejecta with \u0393~ 3\u201310 dominates the observed emission \u2026",

            "The merger of binary neutron stars (BNSs) can lead to large amplifications of the magnetic field due to the development of turbulence and instabilities in the fluid, such as the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz shear instability, which drive small-scale dynamo activity. In order to properly resolve such instabilities and obtain the correct magnetic field amplification, one would need to employ resolutions that are currently unfeasible in global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BNS mergers. Here, we present a subgrid model that allows global simulations to take into account the small-scale amplification of the magnetic field which is caused by the development of turbulence during BNS mergers. Assuming dynamo saturation, we show that magnetar-level fields () can be easily reached, and should therefore be expected from the merger of magnetized BNSs. The total magnetic energy can reach values up to \u2026",

            "The simultaneous detection of electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission from merging neutron star binaries would greatly aid in their discovery and interpretation. By studying turbulent amplification of magnetic fields in local high-resolution simulations of neutron star merger conditions, we demonstrate that magnetar-level (gsim 10 16 G) fields are present throughout the merger duration. We find that the small-scale turbulent dynamo converts 60% of the randomized kinetic energy into magnetic fields on a merger timescale. Since turbulent magnetic energy dissipates through reconnection events that accelerate relativistic electrons, turbulence may facilitate the conversion of orbital kinetic energy into radiation. If 10\u20134 of the~ 10 53 erg of orbital kinetic available gets processed through reconnection and creates radiation in the 15-150 keV band, then the fluence at 200 Mpc would be 10\u20137 erg cm\u20132, potentially \u2026",

Jansky Very Large Array; VLA), X-ray (Chandra X-ray Observatory), and optical (Hubble Space Telescope; HST) wavelengths. These observations provide the first evidence for a turnover in the X-ray light curve, mirroring a decline in the radio emission at gsim 5\u03c3 significance. The radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution exhibits no evolution into the declining phase. Our full multi-wavelength data set is consistent with the predicted behavior of our previously published models of a successful structured jet expanding into a low-density circumbinary medium, but pure cocoon models with a choked jet cannot be ruled out. If future observations continue to track our predictions, we expect that the radio and X-ray emission will remain detectable until~ 1000 days post-merger.",

Starting from the scale of the central engine, we use a moving-mesh hydrodynamics code to simulate the complete dynamical evolution of the relativistic jets produced. We compute synchrotron emission directly from the simulations and present multiband light curves of the early (subday) through late (weeks to years) afterglow stages. Our work systematically compares two distinct models for the central engine, referred to as the narrow-and wide-engine scenarios, respectively associated with a successful structured jet and quasi-isotropic explosion. Both engine models naturally evolve angular and radial structures through hydrodynamical interaction with the merger debris cloud. They both also result in a relativistic blast wave capable of producing the observed multiband afterglow data \u2026",

The magnetic coherence scale is found to grow in time as t 2\/5, much too slow to account for optical polarization of gamma-ray burst afterglow emission if magnetic energy is to be supplied only at microphysical length scales.

Examples include gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, pulsars, magnetars, micro-quasars, merging neutron stars, X-ray binaries, some supernovae, and the early universe. In order to elucidate the basic properties of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) turbulence present in these systems, we present results from numerical simulations of fully developed driven turbulence in a relativistically warm, weakly magnetized and mildly compressible ideal fluid. We have evolved the RMHD equations for many dynamical times on a uniform grid with 1024 3 zones using a high-order Godunov code.
