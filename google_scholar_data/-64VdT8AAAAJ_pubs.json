            "Recently, there has been an emergence of literature on the mechanisms through which parents transmit information, values, and perspectives about ethnicity and race to their children, commonly referred to as racial or ethnic socialization. This literature has sought to document the nature of such socialization, its antecedents in parents' and children's characteristics and experiences, and its consequences for children's well-being and development. In this article, the authors integrate and synthesize what is known about racial and ethnic socialization on the basis of current empirical research, examining studies concerning its nature and frequency; its child, parent, and ecological predictors; and its consequences for children's development, including ethnic identity, self-esteem, coping with discrimination, academic achievement, and psychosocial well-being. The authors also discuss conceptual and methodological \u2026",

The sample included 100 male and female early adolescents, ranging from 11 to 13 years old, from different racial\/ethnic backgrounds. Structural equations modeling was used to examine the latent structure of the multi-dimensional constructs and their interrelationships. Self-esteem and ethnic identity factors emerged which were related and which evidenced efficacy-mediated effects upon prosocial attitudes. The findings suggested that ethnic identity and self-esteem are distinct but related contributors to young people's perceptions of their ability to achieve academically, to find meaningful careers and to value prosocial means of goal attainment.",

In outcome research, an intervention can be said to satisfy fidelity requirements if it can be shown that each of its components is delivered in a comparable manner to all participants and is true to the theory and goals underlying the research. Demonstrating the fidelity of an intervention is a key methodologic requirement of any sound prevention trial. This paper summarizes key conceptual and methodologic issues associated with intervention fidelity, and describes the steps taken to promote fidelity in EARLY ALLIANCE, a large-scale prevention trial currently testing the effectiveness of family, peer, and school interventions to promote competence and reduce risk for conduct disorder, substance abuse, and school failure.

Study 1 relied on a sample of European American preschoolers and their mothers and Study 2 on a sample of African American school-age children and their caregivers. Home chaos was associated with less effective parental discipline; elevated behavior problems, limited attentional focusing, and reduced ability to understand and respond to social cues in children; and reduced accuracy and efficiency in a cooperative parent\u2013child interactional task, after controlling for potential confounds.

            "Described the demographic characteristics, professional development, and faculty and peer support among 182 African-American graduate students. The relationship of mentoring and networking to the professional development of Ss was examined, and the relative impact of faculty mentoring vs peer networking was investigated. Although the support from faculty and staff was salient in enhancing professional development, one-third of the Ss reported receiving no such support at the university or from professionals in the community. Ss who did have support received it from faculty of various racial backgrounds.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

All 7 studies attempted to test in whole or part a hypothetical model in which ethnic-racial socialization in families of color is related to child psychosocial and academic outcomes directly and indirectly through effects on self-system variables such as racial-ethnic identity and self-esteem. Two types of racial socialization messages were of particular interest: messages that promote cultural pride (referred to as ethnic or cultural socialization) and messages that address children\u2019s exposure to discrimination (referred to as racial socialization).
