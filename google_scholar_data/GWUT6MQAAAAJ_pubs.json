            "The purposes of this analysis were to predict the feasible movements during which balance can be maintained, based on environmental (contact force), anatomical (foot geometry), and physiological (muscle strength) constraints, and to identify the role of each constraint in limiting movement. An inverted pendulum model with a foot segment was used with an optimization algorithm to determine the set of feasible center of mass (CM) velocity-position combinations for movement termination. The upper boundary of the resulting feasible region ran from a velocity of 1.1 s\u22121 (normalized to body height) at 2.4 foot lengths behind the heel, to 0.45 s\u22121 over the heel, to zero over the toe, and the lower boundary from a velocity of 0.9 s\u22121 at 2.7 foot lengths behind the heel, to zero over the heel. Forward falls would be initiated if states exceeded the upper boundary, and backward falls would be initiated if the states fell below \u2026",

Another important question is whether subjects benefit more from training forces that enhance their errors than from forces that reduce their errors. We exposed hemiparetic stroke survivors and healthy age-matched controls to a pattern of disturbing forces that have been found by previous studies to induce a dramatic adaptation in healthy individuals. Eighteen stroke survivors made 834 movements in the presence of a robot-generated force field that pushed their hands proportional to its speed and \u2026",

The prechosen movement goal, a sinusoidal-shaped path from start to end point, was never explicitly conveyed to the subject. We hypothesized that the adaptation would cause an alteration in the feedforward command that would result in the prechosen movement. Our results showed that when forces were suddenly removed after a training period of 330 movements, trajectories were significantly shifted toward the prechosen movement. However, de-adaptation occurred (i.e., the after-effect \"washed out\") in the 50-75 movements that followed the removal of the training forces.

Responses to three different magnitudes of forward waist pulls were recorded for 13 young, 18 older-non-fallers and 18 older-fallers. The COM phase plane trajectories derived from motion analysis were compared with the model-predicted threshold values for stepping. We found that the older fallers had the highest percentage of stepping trials (52%), followed by older-non-fallers (17.3%), and young (2.7%) at the lowest perturbation level.

            "We present an initial test of a technique for retraining reaching skills in patients with poststroke hemiparesis, in which errors are temporarily magnified to encourage learning and compensation. Individuals with poststroke hemiparesis held a horizontal plane robotic manipulandum that could exert a variety of forces while recording patients' movements. We measured how well the patients recovered movement straightness in a single visit to the laboratory (~ 3 h). Following training, we returned forces to zero for an additional 50 movements to discern if aftereffects lasted. We found that all subjects showed immediate benefit from the training, although 3 of the 10 subjects did not retain these benefits for the remainder of the experiment. We discuss how these approaches demonstrate great potential for rehabilitation tools that augment error to facilitate functional recovery.",
