            "Apoptosis of mouse neocortical neurons induced by serum deprivation or by staurosporine was associated with an early enhancement of delayed rectifier (IK) current and loss of total intracellular K+. This IKaugmentation was not seen in neurons undergoing excitotoxic necrosis or in older neurons resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Attenuating outward K+ current with tetraethylammonium or elevated extracellular K+, but not blockers of Ca2+, Cl\u2212, or other K+ channels, reduced apoptosis, even if associated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration were prevented. Furthermore, exposure to the K+ ionophore valinomycin or the K+-channel opener cromakalim induced apoptosis. Enhanced K+ efflux may mediate certain forms of neuronal apoptosis.",

Neurons exposed to extracellular Zn2+ plus high K+ responded with a peak cell body signal corresponding to a [Zn2+]i of 35\u201345 nm. This increase in [Zn2+]i was attenuated by concurrent addition of Gd3+, verapamil, \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA, or nimodipine, consistent with Zn2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+channels. Furthermore, under conditions favoring reverse operation of the Na+\u2013Ca2+ exchanger, Zn2+ application induced a slow increase in [Zn2+]i and outward whole-cell current sensitive to benzamil\u2013amiloride. Thus, a second route of Zn2+ entry into neurons may be via transporter-mediated exchange with intracellular Na+. Both NMDA \u2026",

As the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis have been extensively investigated a critical role for ionic homeostasis in apoptosis has been recently endorsed. In contrast to the ionic mechanism of necrosis that involves Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, compelling evidence now indicates that excessive K+ efflux and intracellular K+ depletion are key early steps in apoptosis. Physiological concentration of intracellular K+ acts as a repressor of apoptotic effectors. A huge loss of cellular K+, likely a common event in apoptosis of many cell types, may serve as a disaster signal allowing the execution of the suicide program by activating key events in the apoptotic cascade including caspase cleavage \u2026",
