Apart from being one of the best-studied toxins of bacterial origin, \u03b1-hemolysin is the principal component in several biotechnological applications, including systems for controlled delivery of small solutes across lipid membranes, stochastic sensors for small solutes, and an alternative to conventional technology for DNA sequencing. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the permeability of the \u03b1-hemolysin\/lipid bilayer complex for water and ions. The studied system, composed of \u223c300,000 atoms, included one copy of the protein, a patch of a DPPC lipid bilayer, and a 1 M water solution of KCl. Monitoring the fluctuations of the pore structure revealed an asymmetric, on average, cross section of the \u03b1-hemolysin stem. Applying \u2026",

As a first step in the development of such a tool, we have explored using a nanometer-diameter pore, sputtered in a nanometer-thick inorganic membrane with a tightly focused electron beam, as a transducer that detects single molecules of DNA and produces an electrical signature of the structure. When an electric field is applied across the membrane, a DNA molecule immersed in electrolyte is attracted to the pore, blocks the current through it, and eventually translocates across the membrane as verified unequivocally by gel electrophoresis. The relationship between DNA translocation and blocking current has been established through molecular dynamics simulations.

To complement ongoing experimental studies developing such pores and measuring signals in response to the presence of DNA, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of DNA translocation through the nanopore.

Remarkably, the voltage-free diffusion of the 3\u2032-threaded DNA (in the trans to cis direction) is two times slower than the corresponding 5\u2032-threaded DNA having the same poly(dA) sequence. Moreover, the ion currents flowing through the blocked pore with either a 3\u2032-threaded DNA or 5\u2032 DNA differ by \u224830%. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of our system reveal a microscopic mechanism for the asymmetric behavior.

To use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the behavior of biomolecules interacting with silica, we developed a force field for amorphous silica surfaces based on their macroscopic wetting properties that is compatible with the CHARMM force field and TIP3P water model. The contact angle of a water droplet on a silica surface served as a criterion to tune the intermolecular interactions. The resulting force field was used to study the permeation of water through silica nanopores, illustrating the influence of the surface topography and the intermolecular parameters on permeation kinetics.

MD simulations elucidate the microscopic origin of this effect: Li+ and Na+ bind DNA stronger than K+.

            "The mechanical properties of DNA over segments comparable to the size of a protein-binding site (3\u221210 nm) are examined using an electric-field-induced translocation of single molecules through a nanometer diameter pore. DNA, immersed in an electrolyte, is forced through synthetic pores ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 nm in radius in a 10 nm thick Si3N4 membrane using an electric field. To account for the stretching and bending, we use molecular dynamics to simulate the translocation. We have found a threshold for translocation that depends on both the dimensions of the pore and the applied transmembrane bias. The voltage threshold coincides with the stretching transition that occurs in double-stranded DNA near 60 pN. ",
