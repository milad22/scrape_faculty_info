The maps cover more than 17,000 deg 2, the deepest 600 deg 2 with noise levels below 10\u03bcK-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg 2 of these maps to constrain cosmology. The ACT data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, H 0. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure H 0= 67.6\u00b11.1 km\/s\/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck \u2026",

Supported by the Simons Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, and with contributions from collaborating institutions, SO will see first light in 2021 and start a five year survey in 2022. SO has 287 collaborators from 12 countries and 53 institutions, including 85 students and 90 postdocs.The SO experiment in its currently funded form ('SO-Nominal') consists of three 0.4 m Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) and one 6 m Large Aperture Telescope (LAT). Optimized for minimizing systematic errors in polarization measurements at large angular scales, the SATs will perform a deep, degree-scale survey of 10% of the sky to search for the signature of primordial gravitational waves. The LAT will survey 40% of the sky with arc-minute resolution. These observations will measure (or limit) the sum of neutrino masses, search for light relics, measure the early behavior of Dark Energy, and refine our understanding of the intergalactic medium, clusters and the role of feedback in galaxy formation.",

            "In modern microwave astrophysics instrumentation, system noise is dominated by statistical photon noise. The photon noise can be reduced by terminating stray light paths at cryogenic instead of room temperatures. Controlling stray light at millimeter wavelengths requires careful optical design and selection of absorptive materials, which must be compatible with the cryogenic operating environment. While a wide selection of absorptive materials exists, these typically exhibit high indices of refraction, which reflect\/scatter a significant fraction of light before the light can be absorbed. For many lower index materials such as commercial microwave absorbers, applications in cryogenic environments require overcoming a variety of challenges. In this paper we present a new tool to control stray light: metamaterial microwave absorber (MMA) tiles. These MMA tiles are comprised of an outer metamaterial layer, which approximates a gradient index anti-reflection coating. They are fabricated via injection molding carbon loaded polyurethane (25% by mass). The injection molding technology enables mass production at low cost. The design of these tiles is presented, along with the measurements demonstrating efficient cooling to 1K. We measured their optical performance at room temperature. Measurements verify control of reflectance to less than 1% up to 65 angles of incidence, and control of wide-angle scattering below 0.01%. The dielectric properties of the material were also measured, confirming that the material maintains similar dielectric properties down to 3K.",

            "We present geometrical and physical optics simulation results for the Simons Observatory Large Aperture Telescope. This work was developed as part of the general design process for the telescope, allowing us to evaluate the impact of various design choices on performance metrics and potential systematic effects. The primary goal of the simulations was to evaluate the final design of the reflectors and the cold optics that are now being built. We describe nonsequential ray tracing used to inform the design of the cold optics, including absorbers internal to each optics tube. We discuss ray tracing simulations of the telescope structure that allow us to determine geometries that minimize detector loading and mitigate spurious near-field effects that have not been resolved by the internal baffling. We also describe physical optics simulations, performed over a range of frequencies and field locations, that produce \u2026",
