            "Combinatorial Algorithms for Computers and Calculators, Second Edition deals with combinatorial algorithms for computers and calculators. Topics covered range from combinatorial families such as the random subset and k-subset of an n-set and Young tableaux, to combinatorial structures including the cycle structure of a permutation and the spanning forest of a graph. Newton forms of a polynomial and the composition of power series are also discussed. Comprised of 30 chapters, this volume begins with an introduction to combinatorial algorithms by considering the generation of all of the 2n subsets of the set {1, 2,..., n}. The discussion then turns to the random subset and k-subset of an n-set; next composition of n into k parts; and random composition of n into k parts. Subsequent chapters focus on sequencing, ranking, and selection algorithms in general combinatorial families; renumbering rows and columns of an array; the cycle structure of a permutation; and the permanent function. Sorting and network flows are also examined, along with the backtrack method and triangular numbering in partially ordered sets. This book will be of value to both students and specialists in the fields of applied mathematics and computer science.",

            "Combinatorics belongs to those areas of mathematics having experienced a most impressive growth in recent years. This growth has been fuelled in large part by the increasing importance of computers, the needs of computer science and demands from applications where discrete models play more and more important roles. But also more classical branches of mathematics have come to recognize that combi-natorial structures are essential components of many mathematical theories. Despite the dynamic state of this development, we feel that the time is ripe for summarizing the current status of the field and for surveying those major results that in our opinion will be of long-term importance. We approached leading experts in all areas of combinatorics to write chapters for this Handbook. The response was overwhelmingly enthusiastic and the result is what you see here. The intention of the Handbook is to provide the working mathematician or com-puter scientist with a good overview of basic methods and paradigms, as well as important results and current issues and trends across the broad spectrum of combinatorics. However, our hope is that even specialists can benefit from reading this Handbook, by learning a leading expert's coherent and individual view of the topic. As the reader will notice by looking at the table of contents, we have structured the Handbook into five sections: Structures, Aspects, Methods, Applications, and Horizons. We feel that viewing the whole field from different perspectives and taking different cross-sections will help to understand the underlying framework of the subject and to see the interrelationships more clearly \u2026",

Our criteria for\" large-ness\" are best possible in all cases considered, namely the discrete case, the continuous case with commensurable periods and the con-tinuous case with incommensurable periods. The results are given by the following three theorems.THEOREM 1. Let {fn} O,{gn} O be two periodic sequences of periods h, k, respectively. If fn= gn for h+ k-(h, k) consecutive integers n, then fn= gn for all n. The result would be false if h+ k-(h, k) were replaced by any-thing smaller.",

Le premier chapitre donne des rappels sur la croissance compar\u00e9e des fonctions, les bases de num\u00e9ration, les op\u00e9rations formelles sur les s\u00e9ries g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices, la r\u00e9solution de r\u00e9currences et de d\u00e9nombrements simples, et le vocabulaire de la th\u00e9orie des graphes. Malgr\u00e9 de curieux m\u00e9nagements pour ne pas effrayer le lecteur, les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s sont \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires: \u00e9criture binaire des entiers, somme des termes d\u2019une suite g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, th\u00e9oreme du bin\u00f4me, estimation de\u2211 b n= a f (n) par une int\u00e9grale pour une fonction f monotone... Le deuxieme chapitre introduit le concept de r\u00e9cursion et pr\u00e9sente quelques algorithmes r\u00e9cursifs paradigmatiques: QuickSort, ensembles ind\u00e9pendants maximaux dans un graphe (analyse de l\u2019algorithme r\u00e9cursif na\u0131f), multiplication matricielle de Strassen, la FFT et son applicationa la multiplication rapide des polyn\u00f4mes. Le troisieme est consacr\u00e9 au probleme du flot maximal dans un graphe (algorithmes de Ford-Fulkerson et MPM). Le quatrieme aux algorithmes arithm\u00e9tiques: Euclide, pseudo-primalit\u00e9, certificat de primalit\u00e9 (obtenu par factorisation de p\u2212 1 et preuve que \u03d5 (p)= p\u2212 1) et factorisation, ainsi que l\u2019application attenduea la cryptographie (RSA). Le dernier est une introductiona la complexit\u00e9, en particulier la classe NP et les problemes NP-complets (machine de Turing, th\u00e9oreme de Cook, quelques r\u00e9ductions et algorithmes approch\u00e9s).Le \u2026",

Clear and well-written, it assumes a previous knowledge of the theory of functions of real and complex variables, and is ideal for classroom use, self-study, or as a supplementary text. Starting with vector spaces and matrices, the text proceeds to orthogonal functions; the roots of polynomial equations; asymptotic expansions; ordinary differential equations; conformal mapping; and extremum problems. Each chapter goes straight to the heart of the matter, developing subjects just far enough so that students can easily make the appropriate applications. Exercises at the end of each chapter, along with solutions at the back of the book, afford further opportunities for reinforcement. Discussions of numerical methods are oriented toward computer use, and they bridge the gap between the\" there exists\" perspective of pure mathematicians and the\" find it to three decimal places\" mentality of engineers. Each chapter features a separate bibliography.",

More recently Wilf [2] sharpened Brooks' inequality to k (G)~< 1+~,(2) where A= A (G) is the largest eigenvalue of the vertex-adjacency matrix of G, ie, the matrix whose i, j entry is 1 is vertices i and j are connected and 0 otherwise. In the case of a star graph with n vertices (k= 2),(1) gives only k~ n whereas (2) gives 0 (V'n). In examination it appears that the only properties of the function A (G) needed in the proof of (2) are",

Moreover, b (n) is the solution of a quite natural counting problem.
