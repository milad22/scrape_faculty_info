It is shown that \u03c3 TRM is neither an algebraic nor a logarithmic function of time, but it is found that \u03c3 TRM can be characterized by a\" stretched\" exponential: \u03c3 TRM= \u03c3 0 exp [\u2212 C (\u03c9 t) 1\u2212 n (1\u2212 n)]. Similar time dependences appear in the disorder-diffusion theory of Grassberger and Procaccia and the cooperative-relaxation theory of Ngai, but neither theory in its present form is directly applicable to spin-glasses.",

This ability to selectively modify the dielectric response establishes that the non-Debye behavior results from a distribution of relaxation times. Refilling of the spectral hole was consistent with a single recovery time that coincided with the peak in the distribution. Moreover, refilling occurred without significant broadening, which indicates negligible direct exchange between the degrees of freedom that responded to the field. Nonresonant spectral hole burning facilitates direct investigation of the intrinsic response of systems that exhibit nonexponential relaxation.",

Some of these techniques are based on the selection of subensembles using multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, optical bleaching, and non-resonant spectral hole burning. Others, such as the time-dependent solvation spectroscopy, measure microscopic responses induced by local perturbations. Using several of these methods it could be demonstrated for various glass-forming materials that the non-exponential relaxation results from a superposition of dynamically distinguishable entities. The experimental observation that subensembles can be selected efficiently indicates a large degree of heterogeneity. The intrinsic response is compatible with single exponential relaxation.",

By variation of a recovery time inserted between pump and probe, the refilling of the spectral features could be monitored and was found to take place on the time scale set by the peak in the distribution.
