            "Galactic cosmic rays consist of protons, electrons and ions, most of which are believed to be accelerated to relativistic speeds in supernova remnants 1, 2, 3. All components of the cosmic rays show an intensity that decreases as a power law with increasing energy (for example as E-2.7). Electrons in particular lose energy rapidly through synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, resulting in a relatively short lifetime (about 10 5 years) and a rapidly falling intensity, which raises the possibility of seeing the contribution from individual nearby sources (less than one kiloparsec away) 4. Here we report an excess of galactic cosmic-ray electrons at energies of\u223c 300\u2013800 GeV, which indicates a nearby source of energetic electrons. Such a source could be an unseen astrophysical object (such as a pulsar 5 or micro-quasar 6) that accelerates electrons to those energies, or the electrons could arise from the annihilation \u2026",

A search for antihelium nuclei in the rigidity range 1\u2013140 GV was performed. No antihelium nuclei were detected at any rigidity. An upper limit on the flux ratio of antihelium to helium of< 1.1\u00d7 10\u2212 6 was obtained. The high energy proton, electron, positron, helium, antiproton and deuterium spectra were accurately measured. For each particle and nuclei two distinct spectra were observed: a higher energy spectrum and a substantial second spectrum. Positrons in the second spectrum were found to be much more abundant than electrons. Tracing particles from the second spectra shows that most of them travel for an extended period of time in the geomagnetic field, and that the positive particles (p and e+) and negative ones (e\u2212) originate \u2026",

The magnetic rigidity of the cosmic ray was reliably determined by highly precise measurement of the circular track in a uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 1 T. Those spectra were determined within overall uncertainties of \u00b15% for protons and \u00b110% for helium nuclei including statistical and systematic errors.",

We have detected for the first time a characteristic peak at 2 GeV of p's originating from cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar gas. The peak spectrum is reproduced by theoretical calculations, implying that the propagation models are basically correct and that different cosmic-ray species undergo a universal propagation. Future BESS data with still higher statistics will allow us to study the solar modulation and the propagation in detail and to search for primary p components.",

The fluxes and flux ratios of charged elementary particles in cosmic rays are also presented. In the absolute rigidity range\u223c 60 to\u223c 500 GV, the antiproton p, proton p, and positron e+ fluxes are found to have nearly identical rigidity dependence and the electron e\u2212 flux exhibits a different rigidity dependence.
