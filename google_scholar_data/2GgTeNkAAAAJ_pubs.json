The targets from the CBCT and planning data set (helical or four-dimensional CT) were matched on-line to determine the couch shift required for target localization. Matching based on the bony anatomy was also performed retrospectively. Verification of target localization was done using either megavoltage portal imaging or CBCT imaging; repeat CBCT imaging was used to assess the intrafraction tumor position.Results: The mean three-dimensional tumor motion for patients with upper lesions (n = 21) and mid-lobe or lower lobe lesions (n = 7) was 4.2 and 6 \u2026",

In the current study we present a functional CT technique for the simultaneous measurement of these four functional parameters and the display of each parameter as a functional image over an entire tissue slice. New Zealand White rabbits with implanted VX2 thigh tumours were scanned using CT with contrast media injection. The ex vivo method of radioactive microspheres was used to evaluate the accuracy of BF measurements with the functional CT technique. There was a significant linear correlation (R= 0.96) between regional CT and microsphere-measured BF values, with a slope not significantly different from unity (0.98\u00b10.02, P< 0.0001).

With the advent of fast, multi-slice CT scanners, CT imaging techniques capable of qualitative and quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenesis have been the subject of extensive investigation in the past 2 decades. The fundamental bases for CT imaging of angiogenesis are both the transport by blood flow of intravenously administered iodinated contrast material to tissue and the exchange by diffusion of these contrast molecules between the intravascular space and the extravascular interstitial space. With current fast CT scanners both tissue and vascular enhancement can be measured and traced over time at small time intervals to allow detailed modeling of the distribution of contrast agent in tissue. Both compartmental and distributed parameter models for contrast transport and exchange have been developed \u2026",

            "The geometric accuracy and precision of an image\u2010guided treatment system were assessed. Image guidance is performed using an x\u2010ray volume imaging (XVI) system integrated with a linear accelerator and treatment planning system. Using an amorphous silicon detector and x\u2010ray tube, volumetric computed tomography images are reconstructed from kilovoltage radiographs by filtered backprojection. Image fusion and assessment of geometric targeting are supported by the treatment planning system. To assess the limiting accuracy and precision of image\u2010guided treatment delivery, a rigid spherical target embedded in an opaque phantom was subjected to 21 treatment sessions over a three\u2010month period. For each session, a volumetric data set was acquired and loaded directly into an active treatment planning session. Image fusion was used to ascertain the couch correction required to position the target at the \u2026",
