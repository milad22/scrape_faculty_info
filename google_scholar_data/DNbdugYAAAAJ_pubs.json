            "A systematic search is made for all renormalizable theories of heavy vector bosons. It is argued that in any renormalizable Lagrangian theory high-energy unitarity bounds should not be violated in perturbation theory (apart from logarithmic factors in the energy). This leads to the specific requirement of \u201ctree unitarity\u201e; the N-particle S-matrix elements in the tree approximation must grow no more rapidly than E4-N in the limit of high energy (E) at fixed, nonzero angles (i.e., at angles such that all invariants Pi \u2212 Pj i\u2260j, grow like E2). We have imposed this tree-unitarity criterion on the most general scalar, spinor, and vector Lagrangian with terms of mass dimension less than or equal to four; a certain class of nonpolynomial Lagrangians is also considered. It is proved that any such theory is tree-unitary if and only if it is equivalent under a point transformation to a spontaneously broken gauge theory, possibly modified by \u2026",

These equations are derived from a resummation of the Feynman graphs which represent certain gauge-invariant color-singlet Green's functions, and are themselves essentially gauge invariant. This resummation is essential to the multiplicative renormalizability of QCD in the light-cone gauge, which we adopt for technical reasons. We close the dynamical equations by\" solving\" a Ward identity, a procedure which, while exact in the infrared regime, is subject to ambiguities and corrections in the ultraviolet regime which are beyond the scope of the present work.(These ambiguities are less prominent for QCD in three dimensions, which we discuss also.)

Lifetimes from ion cyclotron turbulence are predicted to be of the order of 1 hour, as observed by Frank for 3\u2264L\u22645. During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, the protons rapidly diffuse across the plasmapause (probably at the Bohm rate) and are lost before reaching the noon meridian, thus giving rise to the asymmetric part of the ring current. During recovery phase the ring current decays on a time scale of a day or less, as the turbulent region moves outward with the expansion of the plasmapause.

Under a different set of conditions, the model is also applicable to the generation of VLF emissions in the whistler mode. It is proposed that a beam of trapped protons at L \u2265 4, supersonic with respect to the local Alfv\u00e9n speed, emits hydromagnetic waves at a frequency corresponding to the occurrence of a cyclotron instability. These hydromagnetic waves propagate along the earth's field lines and are reflected back along the line at the ionosphere. On each pass of a wave packet through the proton beam, energy is supplied to the wave by the particles via the instability. Certain features of the observed fine structure of micropulsations are explained with the concept of bouncing hydromagnetic wave packets. A possible candidate for the necessary proton beam is the belt of 200\u2013500 kev protons observed by Davis and \u2026",

The theory contains two fermions and two vector mesons, one of which acquires a mass via the Higgs mechanism. A formula for this vector-meson mass is derived which becomes exact, and nonzero, in the limit as the strength of interaction is appropriately scaled to zero. The vacuum energy is also discussed.",

            "We propose that SAR arcs are generated at the plasmapause as a consequence of the turbulent dissipation of ring current energy. During the recovery phase of a geomagnetic storm, the plasmapause expands outward into the symmetric ring current. When the cold plasma densities reach about 100 cm\u22123, ring current protons (Ep\u223c20 kev) become unstable and generate intense ion cyclotron wave turbulence in a narrow region \u00bd RE wide (just inside the plasmapause). Approximately one\u2010half of the ring current energy is dissipated into wave turbulence, which in turn is absorbed through a Landau resonant interaction with plasmaspheric electrons. The combined thermal heat flux to the ionosphere due to Landau absorption of the wave energy and proton\u2010electron Coulomb dissipation is sufficient to drive SAR arcs at the observed intensities. We thus predict that the arcs should be localized to a narrow latitudinal \u2026",
