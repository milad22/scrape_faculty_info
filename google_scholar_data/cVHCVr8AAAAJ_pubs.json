The high glass formability is attained despite a low reduced glass transition temperature of 0.58. The inclusion of Y\/Ln is motivated by the idea that elements with large atomic sizes can destabilize the competing crystalline phase, enabling the amorphous phase to be formed. It is found that the role of Y\/Ln as a fluxing agent is relatively small in terms of glass formability enhancement. The obtained bulk metallic glasses are non-ferromagnetic and exhibit high elastic moduli of approximately 180\u2013200 GPa and microhardness of approximately 13 GPa.",

As they are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, these materials tend to crystallize on heating 9, 10. A high degree of crystallization leads to embrittlement, but if it can be arrested when the crystallites are of only nanometre dimensions, the resulting amorphous\u2013nanocrystalline composite actually has greater strength than the original amorphous material 11. There is consequently much interest in understanding the mechanisms of crystallization. Previous studies have suggested that mechanical deformation can induce crystallization 12\u201316.

These systems include alloys of the simple metals and those that contain transition metals. Some of the icosahedral phases (i-phases) are thermally stable while others are metastable; and their degree of structural order varies within each of the stability classes. The importance of sample quality to the exposition of intrinsic properties is emphasized, particularly for systems with high resistivities. As a result, experiments on single-phase samples from the diversity of systems studied have shed light on the physics of quasicrystalline alloys.

The highest peak ZT of a p-type half-Heusler has been so far reported about 0.5 due to the high thermal conductivity. Through a nanocomposite approach using ball milling and hot pressing, we have achieved a peak ZT of 0.8 at 700 \u00b0C, which is about 60% higher than the best reported 0.5 and might be good enough for consideration for waste heat recovery in car exhaust systems. The improvement comes from a simultaneous increase in Seebeck coefficient and a significant decrease in thermal conductivity due to nanostructures. The samples were made by first forming alloyed ingots using arc melting and then creating nanopowders by ball milling the ingots and finally obtaining dense bulk by hot pressing. Further \u2026",

            "Bulk icosahedral-quasicrystalline aluminum-palladium-rhenium alloys of high structural quality and thermal stability are found to exhibit low-temperature electrical resistivities that are four orders of magnitude larger than those found in disordered metals and metallic glasses. Experiments suggest that these quasiperiodic alloys, which have a semimetallic electron density, are insulators at low temperature. The findings are discussed in light of theories on electron localization and band-gap formation in ordered metallic systems.",
