            "In this paper, we propose an approach for studying conjugate heat transfer using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The approach is based on reformulating the lattice Boltzmann equation for solving the conservative form of the energy equation. This leads to the appearance of a source term, which introduces the jump conditions at the interface between two phases or components with different thermal properties. The proposed source term formulation conserves conductive and advective heat flux simultaneously, which makes it suitable for modeling conjugate heat transfer in general multiphase or multicomponent systems. The simple implementation of the source term approach avoids any correction of distribution functions neighboring the interface and provides an algorithm that is independent from the topology of the interface. Moreover, our approach is independent of the choice of lattice discretization and can \u2026",

This fractional heat conduction equation is applied on two physical problems. In inverse procedure, solutions of a previously validated linear dual-phase-lag model on the physical problems under study have been used as the measured temperatures. The inverse fractional single-phase-lag heat conduction problem is solved using the nonlinear parameter estimation technique based on the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method. The results of the present study show that the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method can be successfully applied on the inverse fractional heat transfer problem. The solution procedures employed in the present study for direct and inverse problems have greatly increased the reliability and success of parameter estimation problem. In the present \u2026",

Two finite difference schemes namely an explicit predictor\u2013corrector and totally implicit schemes have been developed. In developing each scheme, a separate formulation approach for the governing equations has been considered. The explicit predictor\u2013corrector scheme is the fractional generalization of well-known MacCormack scheme and has been called Generalized MacCormack scheme. This scheme solves two coupled low-order equations and simultaneously computes the flux term with the main variable. Fully implicit scheme however solves a single high-order undecomposed equation. For Generalized MacCormack scheme, stability analysis has been studied through Fourier method. Through a numerical test, the experimental order of convergency of both \u2026",

Furthermore, we find another regime, where the rotating sphere levitates in the space between the electrodes.
