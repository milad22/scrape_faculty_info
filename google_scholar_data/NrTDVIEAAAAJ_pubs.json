            "This Letter reports new results from the MINOS experiment based on a two-year exposure to muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Our data are consistent with quantum-mechanical oscillations of neutrino flavor with mass splitting| \u0394 m 2|=(2.43\u00b10.13)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 (68% CL) and mixing angle sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8)> 0.90 (90% CL). Our data disfavor two alternative explanations for the disappearance of neutrinos in flight: namely, neutrino decays into lighter particles and quantum decoherence of neutrinos, at the 3.7 and 5.7 standard-deviation levels, respectively.",
