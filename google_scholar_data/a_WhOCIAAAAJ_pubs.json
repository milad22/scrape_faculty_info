            "This review addresses the potential of image-based remote sensing to provide spatially and temporally distributed information for precision crop management (PCM). PCM is an agricultural management system designed to target crop and soil inputs according to within, field requirements to optimize profitability and protect the environment. Progress in. PCM has been hampered by a lack of timely, distributed information on crop and soil conditions. Based on a review of the information requirements of PCM, eight areas were identified in which image-based remote sensing technology could provide information that is currently lacking or inadequate. Recommendations were made for applications with potential for near-term implementation with available remote sensing technology and instrumentation. We found that both aircraft- and satellite-based re-trote sensing could provide valuable information for PCM \u2026",

            "Scientists with the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and various government agencies and private institutions have provided a great deal of fundamental information relating spectral reflectance and thermal emittance properties of soils and crops to their agronomic and biophysical characteristics. This knowledge has facilitated the development and use of various remote sensing methods for non-destructive monitoring of plant growth and development and for the detection of many environmental stresses which limit plant productivity. Coupled with rapid advances in computing and positionlocating technologies, remote sensing from ground-, air-, and space-based platforms is now capable of providing detailed spatial and temporal information on plant response to their local environment that is needed for site specific agricultural management approaches.

The data has been used to assist in the identification of management zones, map crop nutrient status, and detect pest infestations. However, in many of the examples cited, the correlation between a multispectral signature and the variation of interest was limited to single factor experiments (ie, only one factor was primarily responsible for the variability in crop condition). A water by nitrogen experiment was conducted during the 1999 cotton season near Phoenix, Arizona, where one objective was to test the ability of remotely sensed data to distinguish between water and nitrogen stress. Multispectral (visible, near infrared and thermal) data were collected using a prototype sensor mounted on a linear move irrigation system. Neutron probe data were used to quantify crop water status, and petiole samples were used to",

However, mechanisms by which plant senescence promotes remobilization of assimilates are rather obscure. This study examined the relationship between the senescence induced by water deficits and C remobilization during grain fill. Two semi\u2010winter wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.),Yangmai 158 and Yangmai 931, were treated with two levels of nitrogen (normal [NN] or high [HN]) and three levels of soil moisture (well\u2010watered, moderate water deficit, and severe water deficit). Results showed that water deficits enhanced the senescence by accelerating loss of leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll and increasing lipid peroxidation. At maturity, 75 to 92% of pre\u2010anthesis 14C stored in the straw was reallocated to grains in water\u2010deficit treatments, 50 to 80% higher \u2026",

Often this variability can be related to differences in soil properties (e.g., texture, organic matter, salinity levels, and nutrient status) within the field. To develop management approaches to address this variability, high spatial resolution soil property maps are often needed. Some soil properties have been related directly to a soil spectral response, or inferred based on remotely sensed measurements of crop canopies, including soil texture, nitrogen level, organic matter content, and salinity status. While many studies have obtained promising results, several interfering factors can limit approaches solely based on spectral response, including tillage conditions and crop residue.

            "Radiometric data can be useful to determine the impact of field heterogeneity, irrigation, and fertilization on plant water and N use. A 2\u2010yr (1998\u20131999) study was conducted on the South Texas High Plains to investigate cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) spectral and agronomic responses to irrigation and N fertilization and to determine the simple and cross correlation among cotton reflectance, plant growth, N uptake, lint yield, site elevation (SE), and soil water and texture. The treatments were irrigation at 50 and 75% of calculated cotton evapotranspiration (ET) and N rates of 0, 90, and 135 kg ha\u22121 arranged in an incomplete block of size\u20102 design. Plant and soil spectral properties were investigated within a wavelength of 447 to 1752 nm. Near\u2010infrared (NIR) reflectance was positively correlated with plant biomass and N uptake. Reflectance in the red and midinfrared band increased with SE. The mixed\u2010model \u2026",

            "Remote sensing (RS) can facilitate the management of water and nutrients in irrigated cropping systems. Our objective for this study was to evaluate the ability of several RS indices to discriminate between limited water and limited nitrogen induced stress for broccoli. The Agricultural Irrigation Imaging System (AgIIS) was used over a 1-ha broccoli field in central Arizona to measure green (550 nm), red (670 nm), far red (720 nm), and near infrared (NIR-790 nm) reflectances, and thermal infrared radiation. Measurements were taken at a 1 m \u00d7 1 m resolution, every several days during the season. The following indices were calculated: ratio vegetation index (RVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference based on NIR and green reflectance (NDNG), canopy chlorophyll concentration index (CCCI), and the water deficit index (WDI). The experimental design was a two-factor, nitrogen \u00d7 water \u2026",
