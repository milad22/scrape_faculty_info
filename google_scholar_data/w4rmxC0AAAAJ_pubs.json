The relation between gas pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is predicted, over the whole range of cocurrent and countercurrent flows, together with velocity profiles for both phases and the radial concentration profile for the particles. The gas and the particles interact through a drag force depending on their relative velocity, and there are mutual interactions between pairs of particles through inelastic collisions. This model is shown to account for marked segregation of gas and particles in the radial direction, and the predicted relation between the pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is surprisingly complex.",

Although models based on the kinetic theory analogy can predict such patterns for perfectly elastic particle\u2010particle collisions, the predictive ability of these models breaks down for inelastic collisions.

The present work investigates the parameters affecting the discharge rate using the discrete element method (DEM). The effects of particle properties (particle size and size distribution) and hopper geometry (hopper width, outlet width, angle and fill height) are studied and compared to previously published experimental correlations. The results indicate that DEM simulations are fully capable of reproducing trends in the discharge rate that are well-known experimentally. For example, particle size and hopper width are shown to have a minimal influence on the discharge rate. In addition, for rectangular hoppers, the discharge rate is shown to vary with the outlet width raised to the 3 2 power as given by the modified Beverloo correlation.

These design charts delineate mass-flow and funnel-flow behavior based on the hopper wall angle and a given set of material properties. The modeled system consists of hoppers with various wall angles and frictional, non-cohesive, spherical particles. The performance is assessed by measuring the particle residence times, particle velocities, and the extent of segregation during discharge. A Mass Flow Index (MFI) based on the velocity profile data is used to quantitatively characterize the nature of the flow pattern as mass-flow, funnel-flow, or some intermediate.

            "This review article focuses on the modeling of complex granular flows employing the discrete element method (DEM) approach. The specific topic discussed is the application of DEM models for the study of the flow behavior of nonspherical, flexible, or cohesive particles, including particle breakage. The major sources of particle cohesion\u2014liquid induced, electrostatics, van der Waals forces\u2014and their implementation into DEM simulations are covered. These aspects of particle flow are of great importance in practical applications and hence are the significant foci of research at the forefront of current DEM modeling efforts. For example, DEM simulations of nonspherical grains can provide particle stress information needed to develop constitutive models for continuum-based simulations of large-scale industrial processes.",

            "A computational fluid dynamics model was developed for gas\u2010solid fluidized beds containing a mixture of two particle species. To calculate stresses of the solid phase, the kinetic theory of granular flow was extended to consider a binary mixture of smooth, nearly elastic, spheres. The developed model was simulated to demonstrate key features of binary mixture fluidization. Bed expansion with a binary mixture of different size particles, but with identical densities, was much higher than that of a system consisting of mono\u2010sized particles of the same mean size as the bimodal mixture. Minimum fluidization velocity for the binary particle system was significantly lowered. The mixing behavior of the binary mixture of particles, characterized by the mixing index, increased with increasing superficial gas velocity. For a binary mixture of particles of larger size with lower density and smaller size with higher density, larger \u2026",
