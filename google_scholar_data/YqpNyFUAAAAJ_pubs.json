Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual\u2019s trajectory, we find a 93% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.",

A large number of real networks are referred to as \u2018scale-free\u2019because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node 1, 6, 7. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the \u2018small-world\u2019property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the \u2018diameter\u2019of the network 8, 9, 10, 11, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure.

However, human traces are barely random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modelling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile-phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws, but also allows us to analytically predict most of the \u2026",

Apart from its mathematical interest, the problem has practical relevance 3 in a wide range of fields, from granular processing to fruit packing. There are currently numerous experiments showing that the loosest way to pack spheres (random loose packing) gives a density of\u223c 55 per cent 4, 5, 6. On the other hand, the most compact way to pack spheres (random close packing) results in a maximum density of\u223c 64 per cent 2, 4, 6. Although these values seem to be robust, there is as yet no physical interpretation for them.

This question is largely unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale society-wide data that simultaneously capture the dynamical information on individual movements and social interactions. Here we address this challenge for the first time by tracking the trajectories and communication records of 6 Million mobile phone users. We find that the similarity between two individuals' movements strongly correlates with their proximity in the social network. We further investigate how the predictive power hidden in such correlations can be exploited to address a challenging problem: which new links will develop in a social network.
