            "We describe a high-resolution, high-bandwidth technique for determining the local viscoelasticity of soft materials such as polymer gels. Loss and storage shear moduli are determined from the power spectra of thermal fluctuations of embedded micron-sized probe particles, observed with an interferometric microscope. This provides a passive, small-amplitude measurement of rheological properties over a much broader frequency range than previously accessible to microrheology. We study both F-actin biopolymer solutions and polyacrylamide (PAAm) gels, as model semiflexible and flexible systems, respectively. We observe high-frequency \u03c9 3\/4 scaling of the shear modulus in F-actin solutions, in contrast to \u03c9 1\/2 scaling for PAAm.",

To explain these observations we propose that the coupling between density and chain conformation induces a liquid-liquid binodal within the equilibrium liquid-crystalline solid coexistence region. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to illustrate this idea, and several experimentally testable consequences are discussed. Shear is shown to enhance the kinetic role of the hidden binodal.",

The molecular origins of their differing mechanical resistance are still unclear, although the orientation of secondary structural elements relative to the applied force vector is thought to have an important function. Here, by using a method of protein immobilization that allows force to be applied to the same all-\u03b2 protein, E2lip3, in two different directions, we show that the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding is markedly anisotropic. These results, in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reveal that the unfolding pathway depends on the pulling geometry and is associated with unfolding forces that differ by an order of magnitude. Thus, the mechanical resistance of a protein is not dictated solely by amino acid sequence, topology or unfolding rate constant, but depends critically on the direction of the applied extension.",

We find that the new term allows for unambiguous selection of the stress at which two \u201cphases\u201d coexist, in contrast to the original model. For general differential constitutive models we show the singular nature of stress selection in terms of a saddle connection between fixed points in the equivalent dynamical system. The result means that stress selection is unique under most conditions for space nonlocal models. Finally, illustrated by simple models, we show that stress selection generally depends on the form of the nonlocal terms (weak universality).",

By examining inhomogeneous steady states we construct the analog of a first-order phase boundary, ie, a line in the nonequilibrium phase diagram spanned by temperature and applied stress, at which nonequilibrium states may coexist, and which terminates in a nonequilibrium analog of a critical point.

            "\u03b2-sheet proteins are generally more able to resist mechanical deformation than \u03b1-helical proteins. Experiments measuring the mechanical resistance of \u03b2-sheet proteins extended by their termini led to the hypothesis that parallel, directly hydrogen-bonded terminal \u03b2-strands provide the greatest mechanical strength. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the mechanical properties of protein L, a domain with a topology predicted to be mechanically strong, but with no known mechanical function. A pentamer of this small, topologically simple protein is resistant to mechanical deformation over a wide range of extension rates. Molecular dynamics simulations show the energy landscape for protein L is highly restricted for mechanical unfolding and that this protein unfolds by the shearing apart of two structural units in a mechanism similar to that proposed for ubiquitin, which belongs to the same structural class as \u2026",

            "Polyolefins comprise the most widely used class of synthetic polymers, and their conversion into products generally involves shaping a liquid (using a die or a mold) and then stabilizing that shape by crystallization. In the semicrystalline solid state the degree of crystallinity and crystal orientation determines the physical properties and is strongly dependent on processing conditions. 1 The morphology spans a structural hierarchy from molecular (< nm) to just visible (< mm) length scales that is technologically very important and scientifically rather challenging. Flow introduces a profound change from isotropic spherulites to highly oriented \u201cshish kebabs\u201d with a corresponding large increase in stiffness and strength. 2 All industrial polymers have a distribution of molecular species, in terms of both their total length and degree of branching, and the flowinduced morphological transition is particularly sensitive to those \u2026",
