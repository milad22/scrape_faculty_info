            "Inflated pahoehoe sheet flows have a distinctive horizontal upper surface, which can be several hundred meters across, and are bounded by steep monoclinal uplifts. The inflated sheet flows we studied ranged from 1 to 5 m in thickness, but initially propagated as thin sheets of fluid pahoehoe lava, generally 20-30 cm thick. Individual lobes originated at outbreaks from the inflated front of a prior sheet-flow lobe and initially moved rapidly away from their source. Velocities slowed greatly within hours due to radial spreading and to depletion of lava stored within the source flow. As the outward flow velocity decreases, cooling promotes rapid crustal growth. At first, the crust behaves plastically as pahoehoe toes form. After the crust attains a thickness of 2-5 cm, it behaves more rigidly and develops enough strength to retain incoming lava, thus increasing the hydrostatic head at the flow front. The increased hydrostatic \u2026",

            "Determining the distribution of habitat-forming scleractinian corals in the New Zealand region is necessary in order to understand the ecological significance of these taxa and the likely impact of anthropogenic activities on their persistence. Historical records from early publications, research trawl surveys, commercial fishing bycatch and recent biodiversity surveys were compiled for the habitat-forming coral species Madrepora oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis, Goniocorella dumosa, Enallopsammia rostrata and Oculina virgosa. These data were used to describe the observed depth, geographic distribution and geomorphic habitat associations of the study corals in the region.

Repeat multibeam surveys of Monowai Cone from September 1998 and September 2004 and T wave data recorded by the R\u00e9seau Sismique Polyn\u00e9sien network for the same period document the collapse and subsequent regrowth of the cone within this 6\u2010a period.
