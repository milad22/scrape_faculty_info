            "We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy\u2019s supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995\u20132007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000\u20132007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short\u2010period star S0\u20102 provides values for the distance ( ) of   kpc, the enclosed mass ( ) of    , and the black hole\u2019s RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s\u22121 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining   kpc and    . More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3\u2013    within 0.01 pc, \u223c100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the \u2026",
