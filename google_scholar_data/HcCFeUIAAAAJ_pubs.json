            "A Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, halophilic bacterial strain US6-1T, which degrades high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of two to five rings, was isolated from muddy sediment of Ulsan Bay, Republic of Korea. The 16S rRNA gene of the isolate showed high sequence similarity to Novosphingobium subarcticum (96\u00b723 %) and Sphingopyxis alaskensis (96\u00b718 %); however, the isolate formed a distinct phyletic line within the genus Novosphingobium. DNA\u2013DNA relatedness between US6-1T and the closest strain N. subarcticum revealed that strain US6-1T was independent from this species. Isolate US6-1T had ubiquinone 10 and a DNA G+C ratio of 61\u00b71 mol%. Major fatty acids were octadecanoic acid (18 : 1\u03c97), hexadecanoic acid (16 : 1\u03c97) and 2-hydroxy-myristic acid (14 : 0 2-OH).

Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembly of the minke whale genome, as well as the whole-genome sequences of three minke whales, a fin whale, a bottlenose dolphin and a finless porpoise. Our comparative genomic analysis identified an expansion in the whale lineage of gene families associated with stress-responsive proteins and anaerobic metabolism, whereas gene families related to body hair and sensory receptors were contracted. Our analysis also identified whale-specific mutations in genes encoding antioxidants and enzymes controlling blood pressure and salt concentration. Overall the whale-genome sequences exhibited distinct features that are associated with the physiological and morphological changes needed for life in an aquatic environment, marked by resistance to \u2026",

Subsequently, a fosmid clone was selected, and the whole sequence of 36 kb insert of the fosmid clone was determined by shotgun sequencing. The sequence analysis revealed the presence of 25 open reading frames (ORF), and ORF20 (EML1) showed similarities to lipases. Phylogenetic analysis of EML1 suggested that the protein belonged to a new family of esterase\/lipase together with LipG. The EML1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by metal-chelating chromatography. The optimum activity of the purified EML1 (rEML1) occurred at pH 8.0 and 25\u00b0C, respectively, and rEML1 displayed more than 50% activity at 5\u00b0C.

            "Sixteen sediment samples collected from eight transects in a mangrove swamp of the Jiulong River Estuary, Fujian, China were investigated for their content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the biodegradation potential of the indigenous microorganisms. The bacterial community structures in the mangrove sediments and in enrichment cultures were also investigated. The results showed that the total PAHs concentration of mangrove sediments ranged from 280 to 1074 ng g\u22121 dry weight, that the PAHs composition pattern in the mangrove sediments was dominated by high molecular weight PAH components (4\u20136 rings), and that Benzo[ghi]perylene and Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene were the most dominant at different stations. Abundant PAH-degrading bacteria were found in all the stations, the values of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria ranged from 5.85 \u00d7 104 to 7.80 \u00d7 105 CFU g\u22121 dry weight \u2026",
