This bandgap value agrees with theoretical calculations and recent experimental results of epitaxial BiFeO3 films, demonstrating only minimal bandgap change with lattice distortion. Both absorption and cathodoluminescence spectra show defect transitions at 2.20 and 2.45eV, of which the latter can be attributed to defect states due to oxygen vacancies.",

Spectroscopic measurements reveal a striking, linear dependence of the out-of-plane anisotropy on the strain-induced tetragonal distortion of the Sr 2 FeMoO 6 lattice. This anisotropy can be tuned from+ 2000 to\u2212 3300 Oe, a range sufficient to rotate the easy axis from in plane to out of plane. Combined with its half-metallicity and high Curie temperature, this result implies a broad range of scientific and technological applications for this novel spintronic material.",

We establish the conditions that lead to bad metal and non-Fermi liquid phases in NdNiO3, which exhibits a prototype bandwidth-controlled metal-insulator transition. We show that resistance saturation is determined by the magnitude of Ni eg orbital splitting, which can be tuned by strain in epitaxial films, causing the appearance of bad metal behavior under certain conditions. The results shed light on the nature of a crossover to a non-Fermi liquid metal phase and provide a predictive criterion for Anderson localization. They elucidate a seemingly complex phase behavior as a function of film strain and confinement and provide guidelines for orbital engineering and novel devices.",

Unstrained lattice parameters and lattice mismatch strains are evaluated for films grown under a range of growth pressures and on different substrates. It is shown that both the temperature of the MIT and the Hall coefficient in the metallic phase are highly sensitive to film strain. In films grown with lower oxygen\/total growth pressures, very large compressive in-plane strains can be obtained, which can act to suppress the MIT. Both the Hall coefficient and the temperature of the MIT are relatively insensitive to growth pressure, provided that films under the same strain are compared. The results support an itinerant picture of the transition that is controlled by the Ni eg bands, and that is relatively insensitive to changes in film stoichiometry.",
