            "In this paper, a number of frequency-domain dynamic analysis procedures of randomly disordered structural systems in the medium frequency range are integrated into the stochastic finite element method. In all cases, frequency-domain model reduction strategies are used to minimize the computational effort in the mid-frequency range. Firstly, an energy operator approach (EOA) is investigated. In this procedure, an energy operator adapted to a fixed medium frequency band is defined whose dominant eigensubspace is used to construct a reduced model using a Ritz\u2013Galerkin method. Secondly, the proper orthogonal decomposition method is used to extract the spatial dominant coherent structures in the vibration wave field in the mid-frequency band. The coherent structures are the eigenvectors corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues of the spatial autocorrelation function of the system response \u2026",

The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is used to extract proper orthogonal modes that describe the system behaviour from time-series response data. These time series have been obtained via the conventional Galerkin approach (using normal modes as a projection basis) with an accurate model involving 16 degrees of freedom, validated in previous studies.

Broadly speaking, there are two aspects to this problem. The first is the quantification of parametric and non-parametric uncertainties associated with the model and the second is the propagation of uncertainties through the model. While the methods of uncertainty propagation have been extensively researched in the past three decades (e.g., the stochastic finite element method), only relatively recently has quantification been considered seriously. This paper considers uncertainty quantification with the aim of gaining more insight into the nature of uncertainties in medium- and high-frequency vibration problems.

The spatial decomposition is achieved through a Schur\u2010complement\u2010based domain decomposition. The methodology aims to exploit the full potential of high\u2010performance computing platforms by reducing discretization errors with high\u2010resolution numerical model in conjunction to giving due regards to uncertainty in the system.

A modification to the definition of critical excitation is proposed which takes into account the entropy rate as a measure of uncertainty in the earthquake loads.

            "The proper orthogonal decomposition method is used to obtain a low-dimensional model for the planar non-linear dynamics of a horizontal fluid-conveying cantilever undergoing a limit cycle oscillation. The finite-dimensional approximation of the non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) describing the oscillation is carried out by a Galerkin projection scheme, using both the cantilever beam modes and proper orthogonal modes (coherent structures) as projection bases, which leads to a finite set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The proper orthogonal modes are obtained semi-analytically using the cantilever beam modes as a basis. A systematic study is then carried out, focusing on the jumps in the linear stability diagram of a horizontal fluid-conveying cantilever vis-\u00e0-vis the order of the finite-dimensional model obtained using either the beam modes or the proper orthogonal modes.
