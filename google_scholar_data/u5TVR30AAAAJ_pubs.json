This includes the first Keck Array observations at 95 GHz. The maps reach a depth of 50 nK deg in Stokes Q and U in the 150 GHz band and 127 nK deg in the 95 GHz band. We take auto- and cross-spectra between these maps and publicly available maps from WMAP and Planck at frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz. An excess over lensed \u039bCDM is detected at modest significance in the 95 \u00d7 150 BB spectrum, and is consistent with the dust contribution expected from our previous work. No significant evidence for synchrotron emission is found in spectra such as 23 \u00d7 95, or for correlation between the dust and synchrotron sky patterns in spectra such as 23 \u00d7 353. We take the likelihood of all the spectra for a multicomponent model including lensed \u039bCDM, dust, synchrotron, and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r) using priors on the frequency spectral behaviors of dust and synchrotron emission from previous analyses of WMAP and Planck data in other regions of the sky. This analysis yields an upper limit r0.05 < 0.09 at 95% confidence, which is robust to variations explored in analysis and priors. Combining these B-mode results with the (more model-dependent) constraints from Planck analysis of CMB temperature plus baryon acoustic oscillations and other data yields a combined limit r0.05 < 0.07 at 95% confidence.

Measuring B-modes requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control of systematics. The BICEP 2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26 cm aperture and cold, on-axis, refractive optics. BICEP 2 also adopted a new detector design in which beam-defining slot antenna arrays couple to transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers, all fabricated on a common substrate.

            "The Keck Array is a system of cosmic microwave background polarimeters, each similar to the Bicep2 experiment. In this paper we report results from the 2012 to 2013 observing seasons, during which the Keck Array consisted of five receivers all operating in the same (150 GHz) frequency band and observing field as Bicep2. We again find an excess of B-mode power over the lensed-\u039bCDM expectation of> 5\u03c3 in the range 30< \u2113< 150 and confirm that this is not due to systematics using jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements. In map difference and spectral difference tests these new data are shown to be consistent with Bicep2. Finally, we combine the maps from the two experiments to produce final Q and U maps which have a depth of 57 nK deg (3.4 \u03bcK arcmin) over an effective area of 400 deg 2 for an equivalent survey weight of 250,000 \u03bcK\u2212 2. The final BB band powers have \u2026",
