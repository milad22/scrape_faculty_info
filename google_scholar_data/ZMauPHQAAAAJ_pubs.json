The reaction populated all the known bound states of 12 Be. The ground state s-wave spectroscopic factor was determined to be 0.28\u2212 0.07+ 0.03 while that for the long-lived 0 2+ excited state was 0.73\u2212 0.40+ 0.27. This observation, together with the smaller effective separation energy indicates enhanced probability for an extended density tail beyond the 10 Be core for the 0 2+ excited state compared to the ground state.",

Our results conclusively establish the existence of the weak shell effect at N= 32, narrowing down the abrupt onset of this shell closure. Our data were compared with state-of-the-art ab initio shell model calculations which, despite very successfully describing where the N= 32 shell gap is strong, overpredict its strength and extent in titanium and heavier isotones.

The \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidences from the 110 In decay leads to many new assignments of \u03b3 rays observed in the (n, n\u2032 \u03b3) reaction, permitting the observation of weak low-energy transitions, and setting stringent upper limits on unobserved decay branches. The uncertainties on many of the lifetimes from the (n, n\u2032 \u03b3) reaction are significantly reduced, and limits are established for the lifetimes of levels too long for a direct measurement. The absence of enhanced transitions between the previously assigned phonon states and the deformed intruder states strongly suggests that mixing between the configurations is generally weak, refuting the strong-mixing scenario as an explanation of the decay pattern of the excited 0+ states in \u2026",

            "High-statistics \u03b2-decay measurements of Ag 112 and In 112 were performed to study the structure of the Cd 112 nucleus. The precise energies of the doublet of levels at 1871 keV, for which the 0+ member has been suggested as a possible daughter state following neutrinoless double electron capture of Sn 112, were determined to be 1871.137 (72) keV (0 4+ level) and 1870.743 (54) keV (4 2+ level). The nature of the 0 4+ level, required for the calculation of the nuclear matrix element that would be needed to extract a neutrino mass from neutrinoless double electron capture to this state, is suggested to be of intruder origin.",
