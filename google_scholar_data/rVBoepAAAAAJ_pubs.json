Subsequently, Green\u2019s function-based Landauer\u2013B\u00fcttiker multichannel formalism within a tight-binding model is used to calculate the electron transport, and our results suggest that H2O molecules adsorbed on the NT surface reduce the electronic conduction in the tube in agreement with recent experimental measurements. The decrease of conductance with water adsorption is explained on the basis of charge transfer between the adsorbate and the NT.",

Our calculation reveals that the current for a parallel (ON) alignment of the spins at opposite ends of the molecular wire is significantly higher than for the antiparallel (OFF) alignment.

The model molecular-wire exhibits current switching between the planar and perpendicular orientations of the two \u03c0-electron moieties with respect to each other. The current in the planar orientation is found to be 64 nA for an operating potential difference of 2.5 V. The current modulation (ON\/OFF ratio) between the two conformational states of the molecule is calculated to be more than 7 at a switching voltage of 2.5 V. The energy barrier between the molecular conformations corresponding to the ON and OFF states are tens of k B T at room temperature, suggesting that the two states would remain isolated under normal operating conditions",

A first-principles quantum transport calculation in a Fe-terpyridine linker molecule sandwiched between a pair of gold electrodes is presented. Upon increasing the applied bias, it is found that a new phase in the broken symmetry wave function of the molecule emerges from the mixing of occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals. As a consequence, a nonlinear change in the coupling between the molecule and the lead is evolved resulting in NDR. This model can be used to explain NDR in other classes of metal-molecule junction devices.",

The effect of external bias is explicitly included to investigate the spin-valve behavior.
