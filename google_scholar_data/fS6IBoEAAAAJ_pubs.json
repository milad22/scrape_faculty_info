            "The JILA multidimensional optical nonlinear spectrometer (JILA-MONSTR) is a robust, ultrastable platform consisting of nested and folded Michelson interferometers that can be actively phase stabilized. This platform generates a square of identical laser pulses that can be adjusted to have arbitrary time delay between them while maintaining phase stability. The JILA-MONSTR provides output pulses for nonlinear excitation of materials and phase-stabilized reference pulses for heterodyne detection of the induced signal. This arrangement is ideal for performing coherent optical experiments, such as multidimensional Fourier-transform spectroscopy, which records the phase of the nonlinear signal as a function of the time delay between several of the excitation pulses. The resulting multidimensional spectrum is obtained from a Fourier transform. This spectrum can resolve, separate, and isolate coherent contributions \u2026",

Coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy and temperature dependent absorption, combined with theoretical calculations of the phonon spectra, indicate electron-phonon interactions, to be the limiting factor.

The shift of the band gap energy with temperature depends on the diameter of the quantum dots, and for sufficiently small quantum dots, the energy shift of the band gap becomes flat and even switches sign, following the behavior of conventional semiconductors.
