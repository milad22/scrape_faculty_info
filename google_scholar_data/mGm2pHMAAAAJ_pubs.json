            "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",

The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au\u2009+\u2009Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet \u2026",

The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region (| \u03b7|< 0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2< p t< 5.0 GeV\/c. The elliptic flow signal v 2, measured using the 4-particle correlation method, averaged over transverse momentum and pseudorapidity is 0.087\u00b10.002 (stat)\u00b10.003 (syst) in the 40%\u201350% centrality class. The differential elliptic flow v 2 (p t) reaches a maximum of 0.2 near p t= 3 GeV\/c. Compared to RHIC Au-Au collisions at s N N= 200 GeV, the elliptic flow increases by about 30%. Some hydrodynamic model predictions which include viscous corrections are in agreement with the observed increase.",

Two long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near side and one on the away side, are observed when the per-trigger yield obtained in low-multiplicity events is subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity events. The excess on the near-side is qualitatively similar to that recently reported by the CMS Collaboration, while the excess on the away-side is reported for the first time.

These results demonstrate that the strong suppression of the inclusive yield and back-to-back correlations at high p T previously observed in central A u+ A u collisions are due to final-state interactions with the dense medium generated in such collisions.",

Average transverse momenta, total particle production, particle yield ratios, strangeness, and baryon production rates are investigated as a function of the collision system and centrality. The transverse momentum spectra are found to be flatter for heavy particles than for light particles in all collision systems; the effect is more prominent for more central collisions. The extracted average transverse momentum of each particle species follows a trend determined by the total charged-particle multiplicity density. The Bjorken energy density estimate is at least several GeV\/fm 3 for a formation time less than \u2026",

We report first results on elliptic flow of charged particles at midrapidity in Au+ Au collisions at s NN= 130 GeV using the STAR Time Projection Chamber at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The elliptic flow signal, v 2, averaged over transverse momentum, reaches values of about 6% for relatively peripheral collisions and decreases for the more central collisions. This can be interpreted as the observation of a higher degree of thermalization than at lower collision energies. Pseudorapidity and transverse momentum dependence of elliptic flow are also presented.",

The collision energy dependence of the yields and the centrality and p T dependence of the suppression provide stringent constraints on theoretical models of suppression.
