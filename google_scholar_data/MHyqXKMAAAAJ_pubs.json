            "Melanoma is a tumour of transformed melanocytes, which are originally derived from the embryonic neural crest. It is unknown to what extent the programs that regulate neural crest development interact with mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human melanoma 1. We have used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF (V600E)(which encodes an amino acid substitution mutant of BRAF) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa: BRAF (V600E) and lack p53 (also known as tp53) have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen \u2026",

The Lef-1\/Tcf family of Wnt-regulated  transcription factors plays a major role in specification of the hair shaft,  but little is known about how the equally important hair channel, the inner  root sheath (IRS), develops in concert to shape and guide the hair. In a  microarray screen to search for transcriptional regulators of hair follicle  morphogenesis, we identified GATA-3, a key regulator of T-cell lineage  determination. Surprisingly, this transcription factor is essential for stem  cell lineage determination in skin, where it is expressed at the onset of  epidermal stratification and IRS specification in follicles.  GATA-3-null\/lacZ knock-in embryos can survive up to  embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5), when they fail to form the IRS. Skin grafting  unveiled additional defects in GATA-3-null hairs and follicles.

As screenings are carried out in the context of a complete, developing organism, this approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the range of a chemical's effects than that provided by, for example, a cell culture-based or in vitro biochemical assay.

Here we characterize the JCV-specific T cell responses in healthy donors and natalizumab-treated MS patients to reveal functional differences that may account for the development of natalizumab-associated PML. CD4 and CD8 T cell responses specific for all JCV proteins were readily identified in MS patients and healthy volunteers. The magnitude and quality of responses to JCV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) did not change from baseline through several months of natalizumab therapy. However, the frequency of T cells producing IL-10 upon mitogenic stimulation transiently increased after the first dose. In addition, MS patients with natalizumab-associated PML were distinguished from all other subjects in that they either had no detectable JCV-specific T cell response or had JCV-specific CD4 T cell responses uniquely dominated by IL-10 production. Additionally, IL-10 levels were higher in the CSF of individuals with recently diagnosed PML. Thus, natalizumab-treated MS patients with PML have absent or aberrant JCV-specific T cell responses compared with non-PML patients, and changes in T cell-mediated control of JCV replication may be a risk factor for developing PML. Our data suggest further approaches to improved monitoring, treatment and prevention of PML in natalizumab-treated patients.",
