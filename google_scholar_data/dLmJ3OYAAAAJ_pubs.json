            "In this paper we propose a modification to Shannon capacity bound in order to facilitate accurate benchmarking of UTRAN long term evolution (LTE). The method is generally applicable to wireless communication systems, while we have used LTE air-interface technology as a case study. We introduce an adjusted Shannon capacity formula, where we take into account the system bandwidth efficiency and the SNR efficiency of LTE. Separating these issues, allows for simplified parameter extraction. We show that the bandwidth efficiency can be calculated based on system parameters, while the SNR efficiency is extracted from detailed link level studies including advanced features of MIMO and frequency domain packet scheduling (FDPS). We then use the adjusted Shannon capacity formula combined with G-factor distributions for macro and micro cell scenarios to predict LTE cell spectral efficiency (SE). Such LTE \u2026",

The investigation is based on the 3GPP UTRAN long term evolution (LTE) and a decoupled time\/frequency domain packet scheduler approach is used. It is shown that fairness can be effectively controlled with frequency domain metric weighting or time domain priority set scheduling (TD-PSS) depending on the number of users in the cell. Furthermore we introduce a principle of metric decoupling between time and frequency domain schedulers that is fundamental for maximizing throughput control. The algorithms are simulated in best effort (BE) and constant bit rate (CBR) users conditions.

Our results show that path loss exponent decreases as the UAV moves up, approximating freespace propagation for horizontal ranges up to tens of kilometers at UAV heights around 100 m.

The investigation is based on the 3GPP UTRAN long term evolution (LTE) parameters. A scheduler framework is developed encompassing frequency domain packet scheduling, HARQ management and inter-user fairness control. It is shown that by dividing the packet scheduler into a time-domain and a frequency-domain part the fairness between users can be effectively controlled. Different algorithms are applied in each scheduler part, and the combined performance is evaluated in terms of cell throughput, coverage, and capacity. We show that frequency-domain packet scheduling can provide a gain of around 35% in both throughput and coverage over opportunistic time-domain only scheduling. Furthermore, it is shown that by using an equal throughput scheduler, coverage can be improved by \u2026",
