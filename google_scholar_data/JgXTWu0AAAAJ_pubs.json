            "A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb\u2212 1 collected at s= 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb\u2212 1 at s= 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113, H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H\u2192 W W (\u204e)\u2192 e \u03bd \u03bc \u03bd in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e), W W (\u204e), b b\u00af and \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212 in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113 and H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7\u00d7 10\u2212 9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model \u2026",
