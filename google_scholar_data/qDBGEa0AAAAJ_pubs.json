Our aim was to estimate worldwide trends in mean body-mass index (BMI) and a comprehensive set of BMI categories that cover underweight to obesity in children and adolescents, and to compare trends with those of adults.We pooled 2416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 128\u00b79 million participants aged 5 years and older, including 31\u00b75 million aged 5\u201319 years. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in 200 countries for mean BMI and for prevalence of BMI in the following categories for children and adolescents aged 5\u201319 years: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO growth reference for children and adolescents (referred to as moderate and severe underweight \u2026",

However, much of the genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry 1. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at P< 5\u00d7 10\u2212 8. The majority of credible risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements, and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in \u2026",

To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 GWAS, comprising 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS). Analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry. We generated genotypes for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, and we identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer at P< 5\u00d7 10\u2212 8. Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, we identified likely target genes in two regions \u2026",

The etiology 2 and clinical behavior 3 of ER-negative tumors are different from those of tumors expressing ER (ER positive), including differences in genetic predisposition 4. To identify susceptibility loci specific to ER-negative disease, we combined in a meta-analysis 3 genome-wide association studies of 4,193 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 35,194 controls with a series of 40 follow-up studies (6,514 cases and 41,455 controls), genotyped using a custom Illumina array, iCOGS, developed by the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS).

            "The strong light-matter interaction and the valley selective optical selection rules make monolayer (ML) MoS 2 an exciting 2D material for fundamental physics and optoelectronics applications. But, so far, optical transition linewidths even at low temperature are typically as large as a few tens of meV and contain homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions. This prevented in-depth studies, in contrast to the better-characterized ML materials MoSe 2 and WSe 2. In this work, we show that encapsulation of ML MoS 2 in hexagonal boron nitride can efficiently suppress the inhomogeneous contribution to the exciton linewidth, as we measure in photoluminescence and reflectivity a FWHM down to 2 meV at T= 4 K. Narrow optical transition linewidths are also observed in encapsulated WS 2, WSe 2, and MoSe 2 MLs. This indicates that surface protection and substrate flatness are key ingredients for obtaining stable \u2026",

Objective: The objective was to evaluate the association of adolescent and adult soy food intake with breast cancer risk in a cohort of 73,223 Chinese women who participated in the Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study. Design: A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess usual dietary intake during adulthood and adolescence. After a mean follow-up of 7.4 y, 592 incident cases of breast cancer were identified for longitudinal analyses by using Cox regressions. Results: Adult soy food consumption, measured either by soy protein or isoflavone intake, was inversely associated with the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, and the association was highly statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001).
