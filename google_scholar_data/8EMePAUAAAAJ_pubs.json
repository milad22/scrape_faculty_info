Here we report on the direct imaging of chiral spin structures including skyrmions in an exchange-coupled cobalt\/palladium multilayer at room temperature with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, a high-resolution technique previously suggested to exhibit no N\u00e9el skyrmion contrast. Phase retrieval methods allow us to map the internal spin structure of the skyrmion core, identifying a 25 nm central region of uniform magnetization followed by a larger region characterized by rotation from in-to out-of-plane. The formation and resolution of the internal spin structure of room temperature skyrmions without a stabilizing out-of-plane field in thick magnetic multilayers opens up a new \u2026",

            "Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected whirling spin texture. Their nanoscale dimensions, topologically protected stability and solitonic nature, together are promising for future spintronics applications. To translate these compelling features into practical spintronic devices, a key challenge lies in achieving effective control of skyrmion properties, such as size, density and thermodynamic stability. Here, we report the discovery of ferroelectrically tunable skyrmions in ultrathin BaTiO 3\/SrRuO 3 bilayer heterostructures. The ferroelectric proximity effect at the BaTiO 3\/SrRuO 3 heterointerface triggers a sizeable Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interaction, thus stabilizing robust skyrmions with diameters less than a hundred nanometres. Moreover, by manipulating the ferroelectric polarization of the BaTiO 3 layer, we achieve local, switchable and nonvolatile control of both skyrmion density and thermodynamic stability. This \u2026",

            "Spin-transfer torques offer great promise for the development of spin-based devices. The effects of spin-transfer torques are typically analysed in terms of adiabatic and non-adiabatic contributions. Currently, a comprehensive interpretation of the non-adiabatic term remains elusive, with suggestions that it may arise from universal effects related to dissipation processes in spin dynamics, while other studies indicate a strong influence from the symmetry of magnetization gradients. Here we show that enhanced magnetic imaging under dynamic excitation can be used to differentiate between non-adiabatic spin-torque and extraneous influences. We combine Lorentz microscopy with gigahertz excitations to map the orbit of a magnetic vortex core with< 5 nm resolution. Imaging of the gyrotropic motion reveals subtle changes in the ellipticity, amplitude and tilt of the orbit as the vortex is driven through resonance, providing \u2026",

Analysis of the phase images shows that positively and negatively charged monopoles always move together with the flux channel. Statistical analysis of monopole populations and system correlations shows the emergence of a highly frustrated state for low magnetizations.

Recent work suggests a pronounced Edelstein effect in Weyl semimetals due to their non-trivial band structure 6, 7; the Edelstein effect can be one order of magnitude stronger than it is in topological insulators or Rashba systems.
