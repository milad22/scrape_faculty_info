            "We analyze the light scattered by a single InAs quantum dot interacting with a resonant continuous-wave laser. High-resolution spectra reveal clear distinctions between coherent and incoherent scattering, with the laser intensity spanning more than four orders of magnitude. We find that the fraction of coherently scattered photons can approach unity under sufficiently weak or detuned excitation, ruling out pure dephasing as a relevant decoherence mechanism. We show how spectral diffusion shapes spectra, correlation functions, and phase coherence, concealing the ideal radiatively broadened two-level system described by Mollow.",

Photon pairs generated via virtual transitions are found to violate the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a factor of 60.

Such fields encompass those generated by, eg, a periodically pulsed laser. A general theoretical treatment for the calculation of first-and second-order correlation functions is given which takes account of spectral diffusion through a slowly varying detuning from resonance, permitting accurate comparison with experiments. We explore the two distinct regimes in which the frequency-comb separation is either larger or smaller than the radiative decay rate.

At the pump frequency, the resonant cavity supports a buildup of circulating power while simultaneously enabling Purcell spontaneous emission rate enhancement at the resonant Stokes frequency. The three most common isotopologues of CO2 gas were quantified, and a signal was obtained from 13C16O2 down to a partial pressure of 2\u2009Torr. Due to its small size and low pump power needed (\u223c10 mW) PERS lends itself to miniaturization.
