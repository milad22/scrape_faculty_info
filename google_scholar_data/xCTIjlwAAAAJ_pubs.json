            "Electron-hole excitation and relaxation in the bulk, at interfaces, and surfaces of solid state materials play a key role in a variety of physical and chemical phenomena that are important for surface photochemistry, particle-surface interactions, and device physics. Information on charge carrier relaxation in metals can be obtained through analysis of linewidths measured by photoemission and related techniques, which give an estimate of the upper limit for electron and hole relaxation; however, many factors can contribute to spectral broadening, thus it is difficult to extract specific information on electronic relaxation processes. With femtosecond lasers it is possible to probe directly in a time-resolved fashion the charge carrier dynamics in metals by a variety of linear and nonlinear optical techniques. Femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoemission has attracted particularly strong interest because it incorporates \u2026",

Through excitation of the localized SP eigenmodes incident light is trapped on the nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal scales and its field is enhanced. Here we demonstrate the imaging and quantum control of SP dynamics in a nanostructured silver film. By inducing and imaging the nonlinear two-photon photoemission from the sample with a pair of identical 10-fs laser pulses while scanning the pulse delay, we record a movie of SP fields at a rate of 330-attoseconds\/frame.

Describing the change in energy of the cesium antibonding state with a simple classical model provides information on the mechanical forces acting on cesium atoms that are \u201cturned on\u201d by photoexcitation.

The consistent treatment of exchange and correlation, with the inclusion of many-body one-particle and two-particles effects in self-energy and electron-hole interaction, produces a high-quality description of electronic and optical properties, giving, for some quantities, the first available estimation for this compound. In particular, we give a quantitative estimate of the electronic and direct optical gaps, clarifying their role with respect to previous measurements obtained by various experimental techniques. We obtain a description for both electronic gap and optical spectra that is consistent with experiments by analyzing the role of different contributions to the experimental optical gap and relating them to the level of \u2026",
