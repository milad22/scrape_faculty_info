Through a combination of interferometric and spectroscopic measurements, we have determined for Regulus the equatorial and polar diameters and temperatures, the rotational velocity and period, the inclination and position angle of the spin axis, and the gravity darkening coefficient. These first results from the CHARA Array provide the first interferometric measurement of gravity darkening in a rapidly rotating star and represent the first detection of gravity darkening in a star that is not a member of an eclipsing binary system.",

The system comprises a radio pulsar in orbit around a Be star. We report on LAT observations from near apastron to~ 128 days after the time of periastron, t p, on 2010 December 15. No \u03b3-ray emission was detected from this source when it was far from periastron. Faint \u03b3-ray emission appeared as the pulsar approached periastron. At~ t p+ 30 days, the\u2265 100 MeV \u03b3-ray flux increased over a period of a few days to a peak flux 20-30 times that seen during the pre-periastron period, but with a softer spectrum. For the following month, it was seen to be variable on daily timescales, but remained at~(1-4)\u00d7 10\u20136 cm\u20132 s\u20131 before starting to fade at~ t p+ 57 days.

The measurements were made with multiple telescope pairs of the CHARA Array interferometer and in every case the observations indicate that the circumstellar disks of the targets are resolved. We fit the interferometric visibilities with predictions from a simple disk model that assumes an isothermal gas in Keplerian rotation. We derive fits of the four model parameters (disk base density, radial density exponent, disk normal inclination, and position angle) for each of the targets. The resulting densities are in broad agreement with prior studies of the IR excess flux, and the resulting orientations generally agree with those from interferometric H\u03b1 and continuum polarimetric observations.

We use radial velocity measurements of He i lines in our spectra to reevaluate the orbital elements and to better establish the time of periastron. We list equivalent widths and other parameters for the H\u03b1 emission line and discuss the orbital phase related variations observed. We call attention to a dramatic episode of emission weakening that occurred in less than 1 day that probably resulted from exposure to a transient source of ionizing radiation. We argue that the increase in H\u03b1 and X\u2010ray emission following periastron probably results from the creation of an extended density wave in the disk created by tidal forces. We also discuss estimates of the size of the disk from the H\u03b1 equivalent width measurements, and we suggest that the disk radius from the average equivalent width corresponds to a resonant \u2026",

These relationships depend mainly on the temperatures of the disk and star, the inclination of the disk normal to the line of sight, and the adopted outer boundary for the disk radius. We show that the predicted H\u03b1 disk radii are consistent with those observed directly through long baseline interferometry of nearby Be stars (especially once allowance is made for disk truncation in binaries and for dilution of the observed H\u03b1 equivalent width by continuum disk flux in the V band).",

The individual spectra of the binary components were extracted using a Doppler tomography algorithm. The flux of the system is dominated by the rapidly rotating Be star.

Of these, we observe an unprecedented 11 Be stars that undergo disk appearances and\/or near disappearances in our H\u03b1 spectra, making this the most variable population of Be stars known to date. NGC 3766 is therefore an excellent location to study the formation mechanism of Be star disks. From blue optical spectra of 38 cluster members and existing Str\u00f6mgren photometry of the cluster, we also measure rotational velocities, effective temperatures, and polar surface gravities to investigate the physical and evolutionary factors that may contribute to the Be phenomenon. Our analysis also provides improvements to the reddening and distance of NGC 3766, and we find   and  , respectively \u2026",
