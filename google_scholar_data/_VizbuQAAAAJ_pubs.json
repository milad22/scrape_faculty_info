            "Systems of superconducting islands placed on normal metal films offer tunable realizations of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity 1, 2; they can thus elucidate open questions regarding the nature of 2D superconductors and competing states. In particular, island systems have been predicted to exhibit zero-temperature metallic states 3, 4, 5. Although evidence exists for such metallic states in some 2D systems 6, 7, their character is not well understood: the conventional theory of metals cannot explain them 8, and their properties are difficult to tune 7, 9. Here, we characterize the superconducting transitions in mesoscopic island-array systems as a function of island thickness and spacing. We observe two transitions in the progression to superconductivity. Both transition temperatures exhibit unexpectedly strong depression for widely spaced islands, consistent with the system approaching zero-temperature (T= 0 \u2026",

            "Superconductors are excellent testbeds for studying vortices, topological excitations that also appear in superfluids, liquid crystals and Bose\u2013Einstein condensates. Vortex motion can be disruptive; it can cause phase transitions 1, glitches in pulsars 2, and losses in superconducting microwave circuits 3, and it limits the current-carrying capacity of superconductors 4. Understanding vortex dynamics is fundamentally and technologically important, and the competition between thermal energy and energy barriers defined by material disorder is not completely understood. Specifically, early measurements of thermally activated vortex motion (creep) in iron-based superconductors unveiled fast rates (S) comparable to measurements of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 (refs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). This was puzzling because S is thought to somehow correlate with the Ginzburg number (Gi), and Gi is significantly lower in most iron-based \u2026",

The optimum pinning enhancement is achieved with a dose of 6 \u00d7 10 11  Au ions\/cm 2 . Although the 77 K, self-field critical current is reduced by about 35%, the in-field critical current (H\/\/c) shows a significant enhancement between 4 and 50 K in fields > 1 T. The process was used for the roll-to-roll irradiation of AMSC's standard 46-mm-wide production coated conductor strips, which were further processed into standard copper laminated coil wire. The long-length wires show the same enhancement as attained with short static irradiated samples. The roll-to-roll irradiation process can be incorporated in the standard 2G wire manufacturing, with no modifications to the current process. The enhanced performance of the wire will benefit rotating machine and magnet applications.",

However, these gains are accompanied by increases in the flux creep rate, a manifestation of competition between the different types of defects. Here, we study this competition to better understand how to design pinning landscapes that simultaneously increase J c and reduce creep. CCs grown by metal organic deposition show non-monotonic changes in the temperature-dependent creep rate, S (T). Notably, in low fields, there is a conspicuous dip to low S as the temperature (T) increases from~ 20 to~ 65 K. Oxygen-, proton-, and Au-irradiation substantially increase S in this temperature range. Focusing on an oxygen-irradiated CC, we investigate the contribution of different types of irradiation-induced defects to the flux \u2026",

            "Recent interest in topological quantum computing has driven research into topological nanowires, one-dimensional quantum wires that support topological modes, including Majorana fermions. Most topological nanowire designs rely on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as In As or In Sb, used in combination with superconductors. It would be advantageous to fabricate topological nanowires with Si owing to its mature technology. However, the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in Si is weak. One approach that could circumvent this material deficiency is to rotate the electron spins with nanomagnets. Here we perform detailed simulations of realistic Si\/Si Ge systems with an artificial spin-orbit gap induced by a nanomagnet array. Most of our results are generalizable to other nanomagnet-based topological nanowire designs. By studying several concrete examples, we gain insight into the effects of nanomagnet \u2026",
