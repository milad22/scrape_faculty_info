            "The spin-\u00bd antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice is used to describe the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom of undoped copper oxides. Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques\u2014analytical (spin-wave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renormalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical N\u00e9el ground state, appear to be small. At any nonzero temperature the \u2026",

The Dyson\u2019s equation for the single-hole Green\u2019s function is solved numerically on finite-but sufficiently large-size square lattices. Our calculation is based on an approximate equation for the hole motion that has been obtained using a self-consistent perturbation approach where crossing diagrams are neglected. We have studied the contribution of vertex corrections and found that the leading two-loop crossing diagram is exactly zero. Thus, the leading nonzero contribution to the proper self-energy from crossing diagrams is a three-loop correction.

We find numerous excited states with charge density wave structures, which may be interpreted as striped phases. Some of these are consistent with neutron scattering data on cuprates and nickelates. Without additional terms in the t-J Hamiltonian, stripes can be stabilized only as ground states through the application of artificial boundary conditions.",

            "The dynamic structure factor S (k, \u03c9) for liquid He 4 is studied with the use of perturbation theory in a correlated basis generated by the Feynman-Cohen (FC) excitation operator acting on the interacting ground state. We consider the coupling of one FC excitation to two FC excitations and sum the important contributions to all orders in perturbation theory. S (k, \u03c9) is calculated for many values of k in the interval (0.8 A \u030a\u2212 1, 4.5 A \u030a\u2212 1). We find a low-energy \u03b4-function peak which corresponds to the phonon-maxon-roton spectrum and report its energy e (k) and Z (k) as a function of k.\u2018\u2018Two-quasiparticle\u2019\u2019peaks are also found and they may be identified as roton-roton, maxon-maxon, and maxon-roton contributions. At high k, most of the strength of S (k, \u03c9) is distributed in the neighborhood of quasifree scattering energy \u03c9\u2243 \u0127 2 k 2\/2m, and the results are comparable with results of the impulse approximation \u2026",
