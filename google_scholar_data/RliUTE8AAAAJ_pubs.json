Expression of hMSH2 in E. coli causes a dominant mutator phenotype, suggesting that hMSH2, like other divergent MutS homologs, interferes with the normal bacterial mismatch repair pathway. hMSH2 maps to human chromosome 2p22-21 near a locus implicated in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). A T to C transition mutation has been detected in the \u22126 position of a splice acceptor site in sporadic colon tumors and in affected individuals of two small HNPCC kindreds. These data and reports indicating that S. cerevisiae msh2 mutations cause an instability of dinucleotide repeats like those associated with HNPCC suggest that hMSH2 is the HNPCC gene.",

On the basis of linkage data, a second HNPCC locus was assigned to chromosome 3p21-23 (ref. 3). Here we report that a human gene encoding a protein, hMLHl (human MutL homologue), homologous to the bacterial DNA mismatch repair protein MutL, is located on human chromosome 3p21. 3-23. We propose that hMLHl is the HNPCC gene located on 3p because of the similarity of the hMLHl gene product to the yeast DNA mismatch repair protein, MLH1 4, 5, the coincident location of the hMLHl gene and the HNPCC locus on chromosome 3, and hMLHl missense mutations in affected individuals from a chromosome 3-linked HNPCC family.",

We report that hypermethylation of the 5\u2032 CpG island of hMLH1 is found in the majority of sporadic primary colorectal cancers with MSI, and that this methylation was often, but not invariably, associated with loss of hMLH1 protein expression. Such methylation also occurred, but was less common, in MSI\u2212 tumors, as well as in MSI+ tumors with known mutations of a mismatch repair gene (MMR). No hypermethylation of hMSH2 was found. Hypermethylation of colorectal cancer cell lines with MSI also was frequently observed, and in such cases, reversal of the methylation with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine not only resulted in reexpression of hMLH1 protein, but also in restoration of the MMR capacity in MMR-deficient cell lines.

            "Saccharomyces cells suffering a single unrepairable double-strand break (DSB) exhibit a long, but transient arrest at G2\/M. hdf1 cells, lacking Ku70p, fail to escape from this RAD9\/RAD17-dependent checkpoint. The effect of hdf1 results from its accelerated 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 degradation of the broken chromosome. Permanent arrest in hdf1 cells is suppressed by rad50 or mre11 deletions that retard this degradation. Wild-type HDF1 cells also become permanently arrested when they experience two unrepairable DSBs. Both DSB-induced arrest conditions are suppressed by a mutation in the single-strand binding protein, RPA. We suggest that escape from the DNA damage\u2013induced G2\/M checkpoint depends on the extent of ssDNA created at broken chromosome ends. RPA appears to play a key intermediate step in this adaptation.",

The rapidly increasing information about these mutations needs to be collected and appropriately stored to facilitate further studies on the biological and clinical significance of the findings.METHODS: The International Collaborative Group on HNPCC has established a database of DNA mismatch repair gene mutations and polymorphisms. In this report, 126 predisposing mutations were analyzed.RESULTS: A majority of the mutations affected either the Mut L homologue (MLH) 1 (n = 75) or the Mut S homologue (MSH) 2 (n = 48) and were quite evenly distributed, with some clustering in MSH2 exon 12 and MLH1 exon 16. Most MSH2 mutations consisted of frameshift (60%) or nonsense changes (23%), whereas MLH1 was mainly affected by \u2026",

            "We have characterized a clone carrying a chicken preproinsulin gene, which is present in only one copy in the chicken genome. The gene contains two introns: a 3.5 kb intron interrupting the region encoding the connecting peptide and a 119 bp intron interrupting the DNA corresponding to the 5\u2032 noncoding region of the mRNA. This is similar to the structure of rat insulin gene II; therefore it represents the common ancestor. Since the rat insulin gene I lacks a 499 bp intron in the coding region, the rat genes have evolved by a recent gene duplication followed by loss of this intron in one copy. The divergences between insulin gene sequences, and also between globin genes, show that changes at introns and silent positions in coding regions appear very rapidly (7 \u00d7 10\u22129 substitutions per nucleotide site per year), but that the accumulation of changes in these sites saturates, although not completely, after about 100 \u2026",
