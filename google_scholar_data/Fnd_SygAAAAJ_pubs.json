            "Clark Kerr headed the Carnegie Commission when it created the classification system, so it is not surprising that the scheme bore marked similarities to another element of the Kerr legacy, the mission differentiation embedded in the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education. Indeed, one goal of the new system was to call attention to\u2014and emphasize the importance of\u2014the considerable institutional diversity of US higher education. The classification provided a way to represent that diversity by grouping roughly comparable institutions into meaningful, analytically manageable categories. It enabled researchers to make reasonable comparisons among \u201csimilar\u201d institutions and to contrast them with groups of \u201cdifferent\u201d ones. In describing the new system, Kerr wrote that the commission sought to create categories that would be \u201crelatively homogeneous with respect to the functions of the institutions as well as \u2026",

Using responses to a national survey of doctoral students in the US from 27 universities and 11 disciplines, this paper explores factors affecting students' satisfaction with the advising relationship. We find that both the criteria used in selecting an advisor and reported advisor behaviours influence satisfaction. Moreover, there are pronounced disciplinary differences in both choice criteria and advisor behaviour, and these are more robust predictors of satisfaction than individual characteristics.",

Data were derived from the spring 1994 follow-up of the 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study. The report notes that attendance at multiple institutions is widespread: at 4-year institutions almost half of beginning students enrolled elsewhere within 5 years, although only 25 percent transferred; and at community colleges, 25 percent were identified as working toward a bachelor's degree. The report data, which are summarized in 9 figures and 28 tables, and the discussion cover the following areas:(1) definition of transfer;(2) the general phenomenon of attendance at multiple institutions;(3) transfer activity in general;(4) transfer from 4-year institutions;(5) transfer from public 2-year to 4-year institutions; and (5) transfer activities, controlling for background.

The development of survey-based approaches to measuring student engagement is reviewed, including a treatment of recent criticisms of these approaches. Next, we summarize important empirical findings, including validation research, typological research, and research on institutional improvement.
