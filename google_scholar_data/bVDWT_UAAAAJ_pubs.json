            " A reverberation\u2010mapping program on NGC 4395, the least luminous known Seyfert 1 galaxy, undertaken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope yields a measurement of the mass of the central black hole   M\u2299. The observations consist of two visits of five orbits each, in 2004 April and July. During each of these visits, the UV continuum varied by at least 10% (rms), and only C iv \u03bb1549 showed corresponding variations large enough to reliably determine the emission\u2010line lag, which was measured to be of order 1 hr for both visits. The size of the C iv\u2013emitting region is about a factor of 3 smaller than expected if the slope of the broad\u2010line region radius\u2010luminosity relationship is identical to that for the H\u03b2 emission line.

From the nucleus-free images, we determine the host-galaxy contribution to ground-based spectroscopic luminosity measurements at 5100 \u00c5. After correcting the luminosities of the AGNs for the contribution from starlight, we re-examine the H\u03b2 R BLR-L relationship. Our best fit for the relationship gives a power-law slope of 0.52 with a range of 0.45-0.59 allowed by the uncertainties. This is consistent with our previous findings, and thus still consistent with the naive assumption that all AGNs are simply luminosity-scaled versions of each other. We discuss various consistency checks relating to the galaxy modeling and starlight contributions, as well as possible systematic errors in the current set \u2026",

            "We have undertaken a new ground\u2010based monitoring campaign to improve the estimates of the mass of the central black hole in NGC 4151. We measure the lag time of the broad H\u03b2 line response compared to the optical continuum at 5100 \u00c5 and find a lag of   days. We combine our data with the recent reanalysis of UV emission lines by Metzroth and coworkers to calculate a weighted mean of the black hole mass,  . The absolute calibration of the black hole mass is based on normalization of the AGN black hole mass\u2010stellar velocity dispersion (MBH\u2010\u03c3*) relationship to that of quiescent galaxies by Onken and coworkers. The scatter in the MBH\u2010\u03c3* relationship suggests that reverberation\u2010mapping\u2010based mass measurements are typically uncertain by a factor of 3\u20134.",

            "The AGN Black Hole Mass Database is a compilation of all published spectroscopic reverberation-mapping studies of active galaxies. We have created a public Web interface where users may get the most up-to-date black hole masses from reverberation mapping for any particular active galactic nucleus (AGN), as well as obtain the individual measurements upon which the masses are based and the appropriate references. While the database currently focuses on the measurements necessary for black hole mass determinations, we also plan to expand it in the future to include additional useful information, such as host-galaxy characteristics. New reverberation mapping results will also be incorporated into the database as they are published in peer-refereed journals.",
