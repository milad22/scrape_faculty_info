            "Using a set of scanning probe microscopy techniques, we demonstrate the reproducible tunneling electroresistance effect on nanometer-thick epitaxial BaTiO3 single-crystalline thin films on SrRuO3 bottom electrodes. Correlation between ferroelectric and electronic transport properties is established by direct nanoscale visualization and control of polarization and tunneling current. The obtained results show a change in resistance by about 2 orders of magnitude upon polarization reversal on a lateral scale of 20 nm at room temperature. These results are promising for employing ferroelectric tunnel junctions in nonvolatile memory and logic devices.",

It has been shown that realization of magnetoelectric coupling in a single-phase multiferroic such as BiFeO 3 requires ferroelastic (71\u2218, 109\u2218) rather than ferroelectric (180\u2218) domain switching 6. However, the control of such ferroelastic switching in a single-phase system has been a significant challenge as elastic interactions tend to destabilize small switched volumes, resulting in subsequent ferroelastic back-switching at zero electric field, and thus the disappearance of non-volatile information storage 10, 11. Guided by our phase-field simulations, here we report an approach to stabilize ferroelastic switching by eliminating the stress-induced instability responsible for back-switching using \u2026",

We synthesized high-quality PMN-PT epitaxial thin films on vicinal (001) Si wafers with the use of an epitaxial (001) SrTiO3 template layer with superior piezoelectric coefficients (e31,f = \u201327 \u00b1 3 coulombs per square meter) and figures of merit for piezoelectric energy-harvesting systems.

Stripe ferroelectric domains oriented perpendicular to the substrate miscut direction and free of impurity phase are observed in BiFeO3 on high miscut (4\u00b0) (001) SrTiO3, which attributes to a relatively high value of remanent polarization (\u223c71\u03bcC\u2215cm2).

Properties of this two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) have attracted significant interest due to its potential applications in nanoelectronics. Control over this carrier density and mobility of the 2DEG is essential for applications of these unique systems, and may be achieved by epitaxial strain. However, despite the rich nature of strain effects on oxide materials properties, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity, the relationship between the strain and electrical properties of the 2DEG at the LaAlO3\/SrTiO3 heterointerface remains largely unexplored. Here, we use different lattice constant single-crystal substrates to produce LaAlO3\/SrTiO3 interfaces with controlled levels of biaxial epitaxial strain.
