            "In bouncing cosmology, the primordial fluctuations are generated in a cosmic contraction phase before the bounce into the current expansion phase. For a nonsingular bounce, curvature and anisotropy grow rapidly during the bouncing phase, raising questions about the reliability of perturbative analysis. In this paper, we study the evolution of adiabatic perturbations in a nonsingular bounce by nonperturbative methods including numerical simulations of the nonsingular bounce and the covariant formalism for calculating nonlinear perturbations. We show that the bounce is disrupted in regions of the universe with significant inhomogeneity and anisotropy over the background energy density but is achieved in regions that are relatively homogeneous and isotropic. Sufficiently small perturbations, consistent with observational constraints, can pass through the nonsingular bounce with negligible alteration from \u2026",

The bouncing phase, induced by ghost condensation, is designed to produce a classically nonsingular bounce at a finite value of the scale factor. We show that the initial curvature and anisotropy, though diluted during the ekpyrotic phase, grow back exponentially during the bouncing phase. Moreover, curvature perturbations and anisotropy are generated by quantum fluctuations during the ekpyrotic phase. In the bouncing phase, however, an adiabatic curvature perturbation grows to dominate and contributes a blue spectrum that spoils the scale invariance. Meanwhile, a scalar shear perturbation grows nonlinear and creates an overwhelming anisotropy that disrupts the nonsingular bounce altogether.",

            "Phenotypic plasticity refers to the capacity of the same organisms to exhibit different characteristics under varied environmental conditions. A plastic developmental program allows organisms to sense environmental cues in early stages of life and express phenotypes that are better fitted to environments encountered later in life. This is often considered an adaptive strategy for living in varying environments as long as the plastic response is sufficiently fast, is accurate, and is not too costly. However, despite direct costs of maintaining plasticity and producing phenotypes, a fundamental constraint on the benefit of phenotypic plasticity comes from the predictability of the future environment based on the environmental cues received during development. Here, we analyze a model of plastic development and derive the limits within which this strategy can promote population growth. An explicit expression for the long-term \u2026",

Theoretical studies and laboratory experiments suggest that population diversification could be an effective bet-hedging strategy for adaptation to varying environments. Here we show that bet hedging can also be effective against demographic fluctuations that pose a trade-off between growth and survival for populations even in a constant environment. A species can maximize its overall abundance in the long term by diversifying into coexisting subpopulations of both \u201cfast-growing\u201d and \u201cbetter-surviving\u201d individuals. Our model generalizes statistical physics models of birth-death processes to incorporate dispersal, during which new populations are founded, and can further incorporate variations of local environments.

Primordial fluctuations that seed structure formation in the expansion phase arise from adiabatic perturbations in the preceding contraction phase. The purpose of this study is to understand how the properties of the adiabatic perturbations are affected by the bounce. In particular, a nonsingular type of bounce is considered in which the universe ceases contraction and reverses to expansion at a finite size, fully described by known theories of classical gravity and effective field theory. Two major aspects of such a nonsingular bounce are studied -- the stability of the bounce against inhomogeneities, and the power spectrum of adiabatic perturbations after the bounce. Results show that a class of bouncing models based on ghost condensation are subject to unstable growth of curvature and anisotropy, which alters the adiabatic perturbations and disrupts the nonsingular bounce. Another class of models with a ghost field are shown to have limited instability, though the contraction phase requires fine-tuning; sufficiently small perturbations can pass through the bounce and maintain a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum, consistent with observational constraints. Incorporating features of both models and resolving their problems, an ekpyrotic nonsingular bounce is proposed to support stable contraction and bouncing phases yet produce scale-invariant perturbations. Thus the nonsingular bouncing cosmology provides a possible explanation for the early universe.",
