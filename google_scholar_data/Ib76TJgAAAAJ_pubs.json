            "Cordycepin (3\u2032-deoxyadenosine) has many anti-cancer properties. However, neither its molecular mechanism nor its molecular targets are well understood. In the present study, we investigated novel molecular mechanisms for the anti-tumor effects of cordycepin in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. After treatment of cells with cordycepin, dose-dependent cell growth inhibition was observed at an IC50 value of 200 \u03bcM. Cordycepin treatment resulted in G2\/M-phase cell-cycle arrest, which was associated with increased p21WAF1 levels and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, Cdc2, and Cdc25c in a p53-independent pathway. Moreover, cordycepin treatment induced activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases). Pretreatment with SP600125, a JNK-specific inhibitor, abrogated cordycepin-mediated p21WAF1 expression, cell growth inhibition, and reduced cell-cycle proteins. Furthermore, JNK1 inhibition by small \u2026",

However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of integrated cell cycle regulation and MAPK signaling pathways in the regulation of naringin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) remain to be identified. Naringin treatment resulted in significant growth inhibition and G1-phase cell cycle arrest mediated by induction of p53-independent p21WAF1 expression; expression of cyclins and CDKs in VSMCs was also down-regulated. In addition, among the pathways examined, blockade of ERK function inhibited naringin-dependent p21WAF1 expression, reversed naringin-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and decreased cell cycle proteins.

P. acidilactici K10, a strain of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB), was previously isolated from kimchi in our laboratory, and the molecular weight of its bacteriocin was estimated to be around 4,500 Da by SDS-PAGE. Initially, P. acidilactici K10 and its bacteriocin could not inhibit E. coli O157: H7, when used alone. However, when they were used together with organic acids such as acetic, lactic, and succinic acids, they greatly inhibited E. coli O157: H7 in vitro.

Combined treatment of P. acidilactici K10 with lactic acid showed the most inhibitory effect: a 2.8--unit reduction of E. coli O157: H7 in ground beef during storage at .

For the expression of pediocin PA-1 in E. coli, a pQEPED (pQE-30 Xa:: mature pedA) was constructed. His-tagged recombinant pediocin PA-1 (-6.5 kDa) was translated by cell-free in vitro transcription and translation using pQEPED as a DNA template. Theresult of slot blotting assay showed that transcription of recombinant pedA in E. coli M15 was induced by the addition of isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at the final concentration of 1 mM. Although the recombinant pediocin PA-1 inhibited the growth of E. coli, it was expressed in the host strain and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography under denaturing condition. This is the first report for the production and one-step purification of biologically active recombinant pediocin PA-1 in E. coli.",
