The study suggests that transfer design factors improve performance self\u2010efficacy and reaction measures work as a bridge between content validity and transfer motivation. In addition, the role of transfer design in training transfer theory is explained.A combination of variables is proposed, suggesting further investigation to build a strong training transfer theory. The study highlights the dual role of perceived content validity as a factor to develop positive trainee reaction and increase trainee performance self\u2010efficacy.

To determine the relationship between these factors and their influence on training transfer and to test the model, the researchers collected data from employees in the Malaysian banking sector. Structural equation modeling with Amos 16 was used to test the model and determine the relationship. The study suggested that training stakeholders should manage the training program effectively. Transfer is maximized when trainees have social support, high performance self\u2010efficacy, and transfer motivation. Stakeholders (e.g., trainers, trainees, supervisors, and peers) are important to the training transfer process, as are learner readiness, trainee reaction, instrumentality, and training retention.
