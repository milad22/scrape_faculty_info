            "Reproducible dry and wet transfer techniques were developed to improve the transfer of large-area monolayer graphene grown on copper foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The techniques reported here allow transfer onto three different classes of substrates: substrates covered with shallow depressions, perforated substrates, and flat substrates. A novel dry transfer technique was used to make graphene-sealed microchambers without trapping liquid inside. The dry transfer technique utilizes a polydimethylsiloxane frame that attaches to the poly(methyl methacrylate) spun over the graphene film, and the monolayer graphene was transferred onto shallow depressions with 300 nm depth. The improved wet transfer onto perforated substrates with 2.7 \u03bcm diameter holes yields 98% coverage of holes covered with continuous films, allowing the ready use of Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron \u2026",

By measuring 62 different isolated SWNTs resonant with the incident laser, and having diameters d t ranging between 0.95 nm and 2.62 nm, we have conclusively determined the dependence of the two most intense G-band features on the nanotube structure. The higher-frequency peak is not diameter dependent (\u03c9 G+= 1591 cm\u2212 1), while the lower-frequency peak is given by \u03c9 G\u2212= \u03c9 G+\u2212 C\/d t 2, with C being different for metallic and semiconducting SWNTs (C M> C S). The peak frequencies do not depend on nanotube chiral angle. The intensity ratio between the two most intense features is in the range 0.1< I \u03c9 G\u2212\/I \u03c9 G+< 0.3 for most of the isolated SWNTs (\u223c 9 0%).

This method is then used to study the PL spectra of bilayer and trilayer devices under strain and to find the shift rates and Gru\u0308neisen parameters of two Raman modes in monolayer MoS2.

Measurements on a large number of samples (170 isolated SWNTs) allow us to filter out the effect from extrinsic SWNT properties (eg, defects, tube deformations, substrate roughness) and to obtain information about intrinsic properties related to phonon and electron dispersion relations, curvature and Breit-Wigner-Fano effects, single-vs double-resonance Raman scattering processes, and the resonance condition itself through a linewidth analysis.

            "Raman spectroscopy is used to measure the strain in individual single-wall carbon nanotubes, strained by manipulation with an atomic-force-microscope tip. Under strains varying from 0.06%\u20131.65%, the in-plane vibrational mode frequencies are lowered by as much as 1.5%(40 c m\u2212 1), while the radial breathing mode (RBM) remains unchanged. The RBM Stokes\/anti-Stokes intensity ratio remains unchanged under strain. The elasticity of these strain deformations is demonstrated as the down-shifted Raman modes resume their prestrain frequencies after a nanotube is broken under excessive strain.",

Consequently, the diffraction-limited spatial resolution is improved beyond the limit of standard subsurface microscopy. By realizing a numerical aperture of 3.4, we experimentally demonstrate a lateral spatial resolution of better than 0.23 \u03bcm in subsurface inspection of Si integrated circuits at near infrared wavelengths.",
