            "The highly stable spin of neutron stars can be exploited for a variety of (astro)physical investigations. In particular, arrays of pulsars with rotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect correlated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such \u2018pulsar timing arrays\u2019 (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past decades and collectively form the \u2018International\u2019 PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we describe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs, i.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the approach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for future PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as underestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have often been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and inhomogeneous data set \u2026",

The Double Pulsar has been assumed to dominate the Galactic NS\u2013NS binary merger rate  among all known systems, solely based on the properties of the first-born, recycled pulsar (PSR J0737\u22123039A, or A) with an assumption for the beaming correction factor of 6. In this work, we carefully correct observational biases for the second-born, non-recycled pulsar (PSR J0737\u22120737B, or B) and estimate the contribution from the Double Pulsar on  using constraints available from both A and B. Observational constraints from the B pulsar favour a small beaming correction factor for A (\u223c2), which is consistent with a bipolar model.

We provide an update on the Burgay et al. analysis by describing the changes in the pulse profile and flux density over five years of observations, culminating in the B pulsar's radio disappearance in 2008 March. Over this time, the flux density decreases by 0.177 mJy yr\u20131 at the brightest orbital phases and the pulse profile evolves from a single to a double peak, with a separation rate of 2 fdg 6 yr\u20131.

In addition to spin-noise and dispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise unique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved radio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different observing systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and band-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets. For example, we show that PSR J1643\u22121224 has, in addition to DM variations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs which we interpret as coming from time-variable \u2026",

A basic noise analysis, including the processes which are both correlated and uncorrelated in time, provides noise models and timing ephemerides for the pulsars.

The cluster mass properties and the observed properties of 4U 1820\u221230 and the other pulsars in the cluster argue against the low-eccentricity possibility.

We model the  variation of the pulsar assuming two spin-down rates with sudden switches between them in time. Our results show that the double-peak structure in  has a repetition time of about 630 d until MJD 52000 (2001 April) and 550 d since then. During this cycle, the pulsar spin varies from the lower spin-down rate to the upper spin-down rate twice with different amounts of time spent in each state, resulting in a further quasi-stable secondary modulation of the two-state switching. This particular spin-down state switching is broadly consistent with free precession of the pulsar; however, strong evidence linked \u2026",

            "Pulsar-timing analyses are sensitive to errors in the Solar-system ephemerides (SSEs) that timing models utilize to estimate the location of the Solar-system barycentre, the quasi-inertial reference frame to which all recorded pulse times-of-arrival are referred. Any error in the SSE will affect all pulsars, therefore pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are a suitable tool to search for such errors and impose independent constraints on relevant physical parameters. We employ the first data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array to constrain the masses of the planet\u2013moons systems and to search for possible unmodelled objects (UMOs) in the Solar system. We employ 10 SSEs from two independent research groups, derive and compare mass constraints of planetary systems, and derive the first PTA mass constraints on asteroid-belt objects. Constraints on planetary-system masses have been improved by factors of up \u2026",
