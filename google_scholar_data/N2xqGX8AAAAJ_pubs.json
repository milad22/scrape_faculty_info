            "Following the discovery of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high-transition-temperature (high-T c) copper oxides 1, 2, there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile \u2018electrons\u2019 or \u2018holes\u2019 are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare-earth iron-based oxide systems ROFeAs (R, rare-earth metal) also arises from either electron 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or hole 8 doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility 3. Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity 9, there has been no direct evidence of SDW \u2026",

Here we report neutron diffraction studies that show a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic distortion associated with the onset of q=(101) antiferromagnetic order in BaFe 2 As 2, with a saturation moment 0.87 (3) \u03bc B per Fe that is orientated along the longer a axis of the a b planes. The simultaneous first-order structural and magnetic transition is in contrast with the separated transitions previously reported in the 1111-type materials. The orientational relation between magnetic alignment and lattice distortion supports a multiorbital nature for the magnetic order.",

To understand this, we establish the magnetic structure above and below the ferroelectric transition using neutron diffraction. In the paraelectric phase, the spin structure is incommensurate and longitudinally modulated. In the ferroelectric phase, however, there is a transverse incommensurate spiral. We show that the spiral breaks spatial inversion symmetry and can account for magnetoelectricity in TbMnO 3.",

We use neutron scattering to study the structural and magnetic phase transitions in CeFeAsO 1\u2212 x F x as the system is tuned from a semimetal to a high-T c superconductor through fluorine (F) doping, x. In the undoped state, CeFeAsO develops a structural lattice distortion followed by a collinear antiferromagnetic order with decreasing temperature. With increasing fluorine doping, the structural phase transition decreases gradually and vanishes within the superconductivity dome near x= 0.10, whereas the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed before the appearance of superconductivity for x> 0.06, resulting in an electronic phase diagram remarkably similar to that of the high-T c copper oxides.

            "Neutron-diffraction measurements have been carried out to investigate the crystal structure, magnetic structures, and magnetic phase transitions in RNi 2 B 2 C (R= Y, Ce, Pr, Nd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb). The materials that order magnetically exhibit a wide variety of both commensurate and incommensurate magnetic structures, which argues strongly that the dominant exchange interactions are of the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type. The Nd system exhibits a commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering at 4.8 K, with wave vector \u03b4=(1\/2, 0, 1\/2) and moment direction along a (or equivalently with \u03b4=(0, 1\/2, 1\/2) and moment direction along b in this tetragonal system). For Dy (T N= 10.6 K), Pr (T N= 4.0 K), and the low-temperature phase of Ho, the magnetic structure is also a commensurate antiferromagnet that consists of ferromagnetic sheets of rare-earth moments in the ab plane, with the sheets coupled \u2026",
