            "There are a number of calculations in the literature of the effect of statistical surface roughness on the specular and diffuse scattering of neutrons and x rays which impinge on surfaces at grazing incidence. These calculations do not agree with one another and in some cases lack internal consistency. In this paper I show that these discrepancies can be resolved within the distorted-wave Born approximation. The result I obtain for the specular reflectivity is the widely used version of Nevot and Croce, while that for the diffuse scattering is the same as a recent calculation by Sinha, Sirota, Garoff, and Stanley. The approximations made by Nevot and Croce are clearly revealed by the distorted-wave Born approximation. A simple numerical algorithm is proposed for the calculation of diffuse scattering from a surface whose roughness is self-affine, and the form of the scattering is calculated for a range of parameters within \u2026",

            "Our studies of the spin dynamics for two near\u2010Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFMs) revealed: In CsNiCl3 (S=1) at low T\u226aTN we confirm the conclusions given earlier, but disagreement with the spin\u2010wave calculations used is found for the eigenvectors. For T>TN, the most important result is the observation that all  (\u03b1=x,y,z) are identical, demanding another interpretation for the gap observed than the easy axis one. In CsVCl3 (S= (3)\/(2) ) we could not observe any inconsistency in the microscopic parameters determined above and below TN. Although there is a striking coincidence with Haldane\u2019s conjecture [unexplained gap for S=1 (CsNiCl3), no such gap for S= (3)\/(2) (CsVCl3)], it is not clear whether this can be considered a proof for Haldane\u2019s conjecture.",

            "The phonon dispersion relations of Ar 36 have been measured in the [100],[110], and [111] symmetry directions at 10 K using a triple-axis neutron spectrometer. A comparison of the measured dispersion curves and the best available theoretical calculations based on the Bobetic-Barker (BB) potential shows small systematic discrepancies for the [100] L,[110] T 2,[110] L, and [111] L branches. Otherwise the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good. The data are well described by several harmonic Born-von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n models the most general of which (a three-neighbor general-force model with nine parameters) has been used to deduce values of zero-sound elastic constants. At 10 K (lattice constant a= 5.313\u00b10.002 \u00c5), these are c 11=(424\u00b15)\u00d7 10 8, c 12=(239\u00b15)\u00d7 10 8, and c 44=(225\u00b11)\u00d7 10 8 dyn cm\u2212 2 which imply a deviation from the Cauchy relation with \u03b4=\u2212 0.06\u00b10.02.
