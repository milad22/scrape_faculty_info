            "This book offers a systematic exposition of conformal methods and how they can be used to study the global properties of solutions to the equations of Einstein's theory of gravity. It shows that combining these ideas with differential geometry can elucidate the existence and stability of the basic solutions of the theory. Introducing the differential geometric, spinorial and PDE background required to gain a deep understanding of conformal methods, this text provides an accessible account of key results in mathematical relativity over the last thirty years, including the stability of de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes. For graduate students and researchers, this self-contained account includes useful visual models to help the reader grasp abstract concepts and a list of further reading, making this the perfect reference companion on the topic.",

To this end a certain representation of spatial infinity as a cylinder is used. This setup is based on the properties of conformal geodesics. It is found that these expansions suggest that null infinity has to be non-smooth unless the Newman-Penrose constants of the spacetime, and some other higher order quantities of the spacetime vanish. As a consequence of these results it is conjectured that similar conditions occur if one were to take the expansions to even higher orders. Furthermore, the smoothness conditions obtained suggest that if time symmetric initial data which are conformally flat in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity yield a smooth null infinity, then the initial data must in fact be \u2026",

This geometric invariant vanishes if and only if the initial data set corresponds to data for the Kerr spacetime, and thus, it characterises this type of data. The construction presented is valid for boosted and non-boosted initial data sets which are, in a sense, asymptotically Schwarzschildean. As a preliminary step to the construction of the geometric invariant, an analysis of a characterisation of the Kerr spacetime in terms of Killing spinors is carried out. A space spinor split of the (spacetime) Killing spinor equation is performed to obtain a set of three conditions ensuring the existence of a Killing spinor of the development of the initial data set. In order to construct the geometric invariant, we introduce the notion of approximate Killing spinors. These spinors are \u2026",
