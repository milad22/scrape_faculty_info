The patients' demographic characteristics, risk factors, and symptoms and the results of noninvasive testing were correlated with the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, which was defined as stenosis of 50% or more of the diameter of the left main coronary artery or stenosis of 70% or more of the diameter of a major epicardial vessel.A \u2026",

In this study, we systematically evaluated echocardiographic imaging of the IVC for estimation of RAP in 102 patients undergoing right heart catheterization. This study established cut-off values using receiver operating characteristic analysis for 8 different IVC parameters and then prospectively tested these parameters for their ability to predict an elevated RAP. The IVC size cutoff with optimum predictive use for RAP above or below 10 mm Hg was 2.0 cm (sensitivity 73% and specificity 85%) and the optimal IVC collapsibility cutoff was 40% (sensitivity 73% and specificity 84%).
