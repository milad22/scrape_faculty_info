            "We present a detailed study on dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to isolated gas-phase cytosine (C) and thymine (T). The experimental setup used for these measurements is a crossed electron\/neutral beam instrument combined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Electron attachment to these biomolecules leads to dissociation into various fragments without a hint of any measurable amount of stable C or T parent anions. The fragment anions with highest abundance are (C\u2212H)- and (T\u2212H)-, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to calculate the electron affinities and binding energies of the different isomers of the (T\u2212H) fragment. Besides (C\u2212H)- and (T\u2212H)-, we observed five other fragment anions formed by DEA to cytosine and eight additional product anions were detected in the case of thymine. Ion efficiency curves were measured for all fragment anions in the electron energy range \u2026",

            "We have investigated experimentally the formation of anions and cations of deoxyribose sugar (C5H10O4) via inelastic electron interaction (attachment\/ionization) using a monochromatic electron beam in combination with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The ion yields were measured as a function of the incident electron energy between about 0 and 20 eV. As in the case of other biomolecules (nucleobases and amino acids), low energy electron attachment leads to destruction of the molecule via dissociative electron attachment reactions. In contrast to the previously investigated biomolecules dehydrogenation is not the predominant reaction channel for deoxyribose; the anion with the highest dissociative electron attachment (DEA) cross section of deoxyribose is formed by the release of neutral particles equal to two water molecules. Moreover, several of the DEA reactions proceed already with \u201czero energy \u2026",

Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing graphene using hydrophilic groups can greatly enhance the solar thermal steam generation efficiency. Our results show that specially functionalized graphene can improve the overall solar-to-vapor efficiency from 38% to 48% at one sun conditions compared to chemically reduced graphene oxide. Our experiments show that such an improvement is a surface effect mainly attributed to the more hydrophilic feature of functionalized graphene, which influences the water meniscus profile at the vapor\u2013liquid interface due to capillary effect. This will lead to thinner water films close to the three-phase contact line, where the water surface temperature is higher since the \u2026",

By using thymine and uracil methylated at the N1 and N3 positions, respectively, and taking into account recent results from partly deuterated thymine, we find that by tuning the electron energy, H\u2212 loss turns out to be not only bond selective, ie,(CH) versus (NH) bonds, but also site selective (N1 versus N3 site). Such a bond and site selectivity by energy has not been observed before in dissociative electron attachment. Implications for the mechanism of strand breaks observed in plasmid DNA are considered.",
