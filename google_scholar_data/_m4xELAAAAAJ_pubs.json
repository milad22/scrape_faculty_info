            "Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is considered an option for meeting the oxygenate specifications on gasoline and as a means of converting natural gas to a liquid transportation fuel. In this report, the fuel characteristics and known chemical synthesis schemes for DMC are reviewed. Three production schemes have a commercial track record, while others are still under development. The older of the three commercially proven schemes is undesirable because it employs phosgene. The other two commercially proven schemes have a complex mixture of advantages and disadvantages with regard to the synthesis chemistry and are reviewed in greater detail. One other commercially viable production scheme that involves coproduction of either ethylene or propylene glycol is also reviewed. This scheme is still in the development stage and would require a commitment to coproduce the glycol from ethylene or propylene. The \u2026",

Their distinct catalytic properties are often hypothesized to result from the large fraction of under-coordinated surface atoms 7, 8, 9. Here, we show that size-preselected Pt 8\u2212 10 clusters stabilized on high-surface-area supports are 40\u2013100 times more active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane than previously studied platinum and vanadia catalysts, while at the same time maintaining high selectivity towards formation of propylene over by-products. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that under-coordination of the Pt atoms in the clusters is responsible for the surprisingly high reactivity compared with extended surfaces. We anticipate that these results will form the basis for development of a new class of catalysts by providing a route to bond-specific chemistry \u2026",

Herein, we discuss examples in which the atomic precision has been used to elucidate reaction mechanisms and catalyst structure\u2013property relationships by creating materials with a controlled distribution of size, composition, and active site. We highlight ways ALD has been utilized to design catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability under a variety of conditions (e.g., high temperature, gas and liquid phase, and corrosive environments). In addition, due to the flexibility and control of structure and composition, ALD can create myriad catalytic structures (e.g., high surface area oxides, metal nanoparticles, bimetallic nanoparticles, bifunctional catalysts, controlled microenvironments, etc.) that consequently possess applicability for a wide range of chemical reactions (e.g \u2026",

In the past, assumptions had to be made regarding the nature of the cobalt species present along the trajectory of a standard TPR experiment. The new technique directly provided insight into (a) the nature of the reduction process of cobalt oxide species and (b) the resulting cobalt crystallite size, as a function of the strength of the catalyst support interaction with the cobalt oxide species. A two-step reduction process involving Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co0 transformations over standard calcined catalysts was observed and quantified over all catalysts exhibiting both weak interactions (e.g., Co\/SiO2) and strong interactions (e.g., Co\/Al2O3) with the support.

On-board conversion of fuels (reforming) to supply the required hydrogen has the potential to provide the driving range that is typical of today's automobiles. Petroleum-derived fuels, gasoline or some distillate similar to it, are attractive because of their existing production, distribution, and retailing infrastructure. The fuel may be either petroleum-derived or other alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, etc.[1]. The ability to use a variety of fuels is also attractive for stationary distributed power generation [2], such as in buildings, or for portable power in remote locations. Argonne National Laboratory has developed a catalytic reactor based on partial oxidation reforming that is suitable for use in light-duty vehicles powered by fuel cells. The reactor has shown the ability to convert a wide variety of fuels to a hydrogen-rich gas at less than 800 C, temperatures that are several hundreds of degrees lower than alternative noncatalytic processes. The fuel may be methanol, ethanol, natural gas, or petroleum-derived fuels that are blends of various hydrocarbons such as paraffins, olefins, aromatics, etc., as in gasoline.

In this study, SrTiO3 nanocuboid supports were synthesized using sol-precipitation coupled with hydrothermal synthesis, and platinum was deposited on the nanocuboids with 1, 3, and 5 cycles of atomic layer deposition (ALD). The platinum particles have a highly uniform distribution both before and after reaction testing, and range from 1 to 5 nm in size, depending upon the number of ALD cycles. These materials have a >50 \u00b0C lower light-off temperature for propane oxidation than a conventional Pt\/Al2O3 catalyst, turn over frequencies up to 3 orders of magnitude higher, and show improved resistance to deactivation.

            "Platinum atomic layer deposition (ALD) using MeCpPtMe3 was employed to prepare high loadings of uniform-sized, 1\u22122 nm Pt nanoparticles on high surface area Al2O3, TiO2, and SrTiO3 supports. X-ray absorption fine structure was utilized to monitor the changes in the Pt species during each step of the synthesis. The temperature, precursor exposure time, treatment gas, and number of ALD cycles were found to affect the Pt particle size and density. Lower-temperature MeCpPtMe3 adsorption yielded smaller particles due to reduced thermal decomposition. A 300 \u00b0C air treatment of the adsorbed MeCpPtMe3 leads to PtO. In subsequent ALD cycles, the MeCpPtMe3 reduces the PtO to metallic Pt in the ratio of one precursor molecule per PtO. A 200 \u00b0C H2 treatment of the adsorbed MeCpPtMe3 leads to the formation of 1\u22122 nm, metallic Pt nanoparticles. During subsequent ALD cycles, MeCpPtMe3 adsorbs on the \u2026",

            "Deactivation mechanisms of copper chromite (CuCr2O4\u22c5CuO) catalyst for vapor-phase selective hydrogenation for furfuryl alcohol have been investigated using ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). At 200 \u00b0C, the catalyst steadily deactivated. One of the dominant origins of catalyst deactivation is poisoning due to strong adsorption of polymeric species formed from the reactant and\/or products. Metallic Cu is identified as the active site, while loss of active Cu(I) sites due to hydrogenation is not a deactivation cause, as opposed to previous literature reported. The copper chromite catalyst showed low activity at 300 \u00b0C process temperature. Under this condition, the Cu particle size does not change, but Cr\/Cu ratio increases by 50%, suggesting that Cr coverage of Cu sites becomes an additional cause of catalyst deactivation \u2026",
