The optical spectrum shows a rich pattern of level anticrossings and crossings that can be understood as a superposition of charge and spin configurations of the two dots. Coulomb interactions shift the molecular resonance of the optically excited state (charged exciton) with respect to the ground state (single charge), enabling light-induced coupling of the quantum dots. This result demonstrates the possibility of optically coupling quantum dots for application in quantum information processing.",

Using magnetophotoluminescence spectroscopy we show that when holes tunnel through a thin barrier, the lowest energy molecular state has bonding orbital character. However, as the thickness of the barrier increases, the molecular ground state changes character from a bonding orbital to an antibonding orbital, confirming recent theoretical predictions.
