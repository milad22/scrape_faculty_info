            "The catalytic activity of metal clusters of different sizes adsorbed on oxide surfaces can be explored systematically by using model catalysts. We studied the temperature-programmed reaction of CO with O2 catalyzed by Pd clusters (Pdn, for n = 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 16, 20, and 25) that were size-selected in the gas phase and deposited on rutile TiO2(110). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy revealed that the Pd 3d binding energy varied nonmonotonically with cluster size and that the changes correlated with strong size variations in CO oxidation activity. Taking final-state effects into account, low activity was correlated with higher-than-expected Pd 3d binding energy, which is attributed to a particularly stable valence electronic structure; electron transfer from the TiO2 support to the Pd clusters also occurs. Ion scattering shows that small clusters form single-layer islands on the surface and that formation of a second layer \u2026",

            "Electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 under ambient conditions can provide an alternative to the Haber\u2013Bosch process for distributed NH3 production that can be powered by renewable electricity. The major challenge for realizing such a process is to develop efficient electrocatalysts for the N2 reduction reaction (N2RR), as typical catalysts show a low activity and selectivity due to the barrier for N2 activation and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here we report an Fe\/Fe3O4 catalyst for ambient electrochemical NH3 synthesis, which was prepared by oxidizing an Fe foil at 300 \u00b0C followed by in situ electrochemical reduction. The Fe\/Fe3O4 catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 8.29% for NH3 production at \u22120.3 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode in phosphate buffer solution, which is around 120 times higher than that of the original Fe foil.

Experiments were carried out following two different O2 exposures at 400 K (10 L and 50 L) and for 10 L of O2 exposure at varying temperatures (Tsurf = 200, 300, and 400 K). During TPR taken after sequential O2 and CO (5 L at 180 K) exposures, unreacted CO is found to desorb in three features at Tdesorb \u2248 150, 200, and 430 K, while CO2 is observed to desorb between 170 and 450 K.

After O2 exposure at 100 K, the Pd clusters showed XPS shifts indicative of oxidation. The exception was Pd4, which did not oxidize under any conditions. The inertness of Pd4\/alumina\/NiAl(110) appears to be correlated with a significantly higher-than-expected Pd 3d binding energy, which we attribute to a particularly stable valence shell. None of the clusters examined oxidized during O2 exposures at 300 K or above, but He+ scattering showed that oxygen was bound on the cluster surfaces.

The most stable sites are on top of the Pd clusters (\u201con-top\u201d sites), however, there are also less stable sites, in which CO is bound in association with, but not on top of the Pd (\u201cperipheral\u201d sites). For saturation CO coverage over a fixed atomic concentration of Pd (present in the form of Pdn clusters of varying size), the population of CO in peripheral sites decreases with increasing cluster size, while the on-top site population is size-independent.

Comparison of Pd\/Fe3O4 samples created via Pd evaporation under UHV conditions and those resulting from the solution deposition of Pd-hydroxo complexes reveals that changes in the interfacial functionalization of such samples (i.e. roughening and hydroxylation) govern the differences in Pd nucleation behavior observed over pristine oxides relative to those exposed to alkaline solutions.
