            "An attractive method of obtaining an effective cosmological constant at the present epoch is through the potential energy of a scalar field. Considering models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field, we classify all potentials for which the scalar field energy density scales as a power law of the scale factor when the perfect fluid density dominates. There are three possibilities. The first two are well known; the much-investigated exponential potentials have the scalar field mimicking the evolution of the perfect fluid, while for negative power laws, introduced by Ratra and Peebles, the scalar field density grows relative to that of the fluid. The third possibility is a new one, where the potential is a positive power law and the scalar field energy density decays relative to the perfect fluid. We provide a complete analysis of exact solutions and their stability properties, and investigate a range of possible cosmological applications.",

The evolution of \u03c6 for an arbitrary functional form for p can be given in terms of an exact analytic solution. For quite general conditions on the functional form of p, such models can evolve to a state characterized by a density \u03c1 scaling with the scale factor a as \u03c1= \u03c1 0+ \u03c1 1 (a\/a 0)\u2212 3, but with a sound speed c s 2\u226a 1 at all times.

Fluctuations in baryon density in the early Universe lead to inhomogeneities in the neutron-proton ratio, due to the differential diffusion of these particles through the radiation plasma. For certain types of nonlinear fluctuations, some nucleosynthesis would occur in very neutron-rich regions. Nuclear products of homogeneous neutron-enriched regions are evaluated numerically using a standard reaction network and these results are used to estimate final abundances in an inhomogeneous universe. Net deuterium and lithium abundances tend to increase and the net helium abundance tends to decrease compared to an unperturbed standard model. It is suggested that pronounced nonlinear baryon-density fluctuations produced in QCD-or electroweak-epoch phase transitions could alter abundances sufficiently to make a closed baryonic \u2026",

            "The thawing quintessence model with a nearly flat potential provides a natural mechanism to produce an equation of state parameter, w, close to\u2212 1 today. We examine the behavior of such models for the case in which the potential satisfies the slow-roll conditions:[(1\/V)(d V\/d \u03d5)] 2\u226a 1 and (1\/V)(d 2 V\/d \u03d5 2)\u226a 1, and we derive the analog of the slow-roll approximation for the case in which both matter and a scalar field contribute to the density. We show that in this limit, all such models converge to a unique relation between 1+ w, \u03a9 \u03d5, and the initial value of (1\/V)(d V\/d \u03d5). We derive this relation and use it to determine the corresponding expression for w (a), which depends only on the presentday values for w and \u03a9 \u03d5. For a variety of potentials, our limiting expression for w (a) is typically accurate to within \u03b4 w\u2272 0.005 for w<\u2212 0.9. For redshift z\u2272 1, w (a) is well fit by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, in \u2026",
