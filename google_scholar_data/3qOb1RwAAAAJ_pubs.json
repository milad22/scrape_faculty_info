            "The term collaboration is widely used but not clearly understood or operationalized. However, collaboration is playing an increasingly important role between and across public, nonprofit, and for-profit sectors. Collaboration has become a hallmark in both intragovernmental and intergovernmental relationships. As collaboration scholarship rapidly emerges, it diverges into several directions, resulting in confusion about what collaboration is and what it can be used to accomplish. This book provides much needed insight into existing ideas and theories of collaboration, advancing a revised theoretical model and accompanying typologies that further our understanding of collaborative processes within the public sector. Organized into three parts, each chapter presents a different theoretical approach to public problems, valuing the collective insights that result from honoring many individual perspectives. Case studies in collaboration, split across three levels of government, offer additional perspectives on unanswered questions in the literature. Contributions are made by authors from a variety of backgrounds, including an attorney, a career educator, a federal executive, a human resource administrator, a police officer, a self-employed entrepreneur, as well as scholars of public administration and public policy. Drawing upon the individual experiences offered by these perspectives, the book emphasizes the commonalities of collaboration. It is from this common ground, the shared experiences forged among seemingly disparate interactions that advances in collaboration theory arise. Advancing Collaboration Theory offers a unique compilation of \u2026",

            "Much attention has recently been paid to comparative work in the public and private sectors looking at work values, motivations, and the impact of government reform movements in organizations. Several studies have compared the public and private sectors in the dimension of values; but none have questioned the popular assumption that nonprofit and public managers share the same or a similar set of values or the value expectations they have for each other. This paper reports on the results of an empirical survey of public and nonprofit managers that compares their individual democratic, ethical, and professional values. In brief, the results lend strong support to the assumption that nonprofit employees share the same value set as their public sector counterparts; but their value sets do have statistically significant differences in the perceived level of importance of altruism, generosity, and individualism.",

            "As the world has become increasingly connected over the last few decades, government and public managers have had to adapt from traditional unitary, hierarchical organizations to networked, collaborative, multiorganizational arrangements (O\u2019Leary & Vij, 2012). This changing environment and the continued growth of third-party governance have led to an abundance of collaborative public management scholarship (O\u2019Leary & Vij, 2012; Thomson, Perry, & Miller, 2009). Much of this literature is by its nature multidisciplinary, vast, and highly fragmented. While the varying conceptualizations add perspective and depth to the field, this richness also makes it difficult to compare results and communicate across disciplines (Thomson et al., 2009).What this variation produces is not a simple agreed upon definition of the study of collaboration, but an array of wide-ranging theoretical perspectives, definitions, and understandings of collaborative public management (Thomson et al., 2009). Disagreements abound, from process and structure, to distinctions of organizational relationships, all of which have only served to add to the confusion and ambiguity shrouding the field (Morse & Stephens, 2012). To move forward and to build a common language across the multidisciplinary field of study, it is imperative that we heed the advice of prior work in an effort to identify and discuss the core values comprising interorganizational collaboration. This will allow us not only to better understand collaborative elements and processes, but also to gain additional insight into the critical components that help collaboratives to successfully achieve their program goals.",

Using the rational, normative, and affective bases of motivation, it was reported that affective motives appear to be an important driver for individuals joining nonprofit boards, while both rational and affective motives are important in the decision to continue to serve. It was also suggested that a service ethos early in life is an important antecedent in both the attraction and retention of most board members.
