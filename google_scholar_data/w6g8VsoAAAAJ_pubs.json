The AND\/R is the centerpiece of the Cold Neutrons for Biology and Technology partnership, which is dedicated to the structural characterization of thin films and multilayers of biological interest. The instrument is capable of measuring both specular and nonspecular reflectivity, as well as crystalline or semicrystalline diffraction at wave-vector transfers up to approximately 2.20\u00c5\u22121.

We previously found that collapse of a bacterial group I ribozyme correlates with the formation of helices within the ribozyme core, but occurs at Mg2+ concentrations too low to support stable tertiary structure and catalytic activity. Here, using small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that Mg2+-induced collapse is a cooperative folding transition that can be fit by a two-state model. The Mg2+ dependence of collapse is similar to the Mg2+ dependence of helix assembly measured by partial ribonuclease T1 digestion and of an unfolding transition measured by UV hypochromicity. The correspondence between multiple probes of RNA structure further supports a two-state model. A mutation that disrupts tertiary contacts between the L9 tetraloop and its helical receptor destabilized the compact state by 0.8 kcal \u2026",

However, complete understandings of cholesterol homeostasis in the cell remains elusive, partly due to the wide variability in reported values for intra- and intermembrane cholesterol transport rates. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering to measure cholesterol intermembrane exchange and intramembrane flipping rates, in situ, without recourse to any external fields or compounds. We found significantly slower transport kinetics than reported by previous studies, particularly for intramembrane flipping where our measured rates are several orders of magnitude slower. We unambiguously demonstrate that the presence of chemical tags and extraneous compounds employed in traditional kinetic measurements dramatically affect the system thermodynamics, accelerating \u2026",

Changes in the size and shape of the Azoarcus group I ribozyme as a function of Mg2+ and Na+ concentration were followed by small angle neutron scattering. In low salt buffer, the RNA was expanded, with an average radius of gyration (Rg) of 53 \u00b1 1 \u00c5. A highly cooperative transition to a compact form (Rg = 31.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00c5) was observed between 1.6 and 1.7 mM MgCl2. The collapse transition, which is unusually sharp in Mg2+, has the characteristics of a first-order phase transition. Partial digestion with ribonuclease T1 under identical conditions showed that this transition correlated with the assembly of double helices in the ribozyme core. Fivefold higher Mg2+ concentrations were required for self-splicing, indicating that compaction occurs before native \u2026",

Ideally, other than the uncertainty introduced by statistical fluctuations in the measured reflectivities, any ambiguity in a SLD profile obtained by these phase-sensitive methods is a consequence only of the limited range of wavevector transfer Q over which the reflectivity data can, in practice, be collected. Where practically possible to employ such phase-sensitive techniques, which require the use of reference layers or variable surrounding media, not only is the uniqueness of the resultant SLD profile well defined, but also the ability to perform an inversion without any adjustable parameters eliminates the vagaries associated with fitting reflectivity data alone.
