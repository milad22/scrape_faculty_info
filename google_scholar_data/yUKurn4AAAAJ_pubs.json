            "CMS is a general purpose experiment, designed to study the physics of pp collisions at 14 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking-through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task, CMS must be prepared to search for new particles, such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb-1 or less. The analysis tools that have been developed are applied to study in great detail and with all the methodology of performing an analysis on CMS data specific benchmark processes upon which to gauge the performance of CMS. These processes cover several Higgs boson decay channels, the production and decay of new particles such as Z\u2032 and supersymmetric particles, B s production and processes in heavy ion collisions. The simulation of these benchmark processes includes subtle effects such as possible detector miscalibration and misalignment. Besides these benchmark \u2026",

The data span six orders of magnitude in negative four-momentum-transfer squared, Q 2, and in Bjorken x. The combination method used takes the correlations of systematic uncertainties into account, resulting in an improved accuracy. The combined data are the sole input in a NLO QCD analysis which determines a new set of parton distributions, HERAPDF1. 0, with small experimental uncertainties. This set includes an estimate of the model and parametrisation uncertainties of the fit result.",

Substantial extension of the kinematic range towards low Q2 and x has been achieved using dedicated data samples and events with initial state photon radiation. The structure function is found to increase significantly with decreasing x, even in the lowest accessible Q2 region.

The J\/\u03c8 mesons are produced by almost real photons (Q2 \u2248 0) and detected via their leptonic decays. The data have been taken in 1994 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 pb\u22121. The \u03b3p cross section for elastic J\/\u03c8 production is observed to increase strongly with the center of mass energy. The cross section for diffractive J\/\u03c8 production with proton dissociation is found to be of similar magnitude as the elastic cross section. Distributions of transverse momentum and decay angle are studied and found to be in accord with a diffractive production mechanism. For inelastic J\/\u03c8 production the total \u03b3p cross section, the distribution of transverse momenta, and the elasticity of the J\/\u03c8 are compared to NLO QCD calculations in a colour singlet model and agreement is found.

            "A combination is presented of all inclusive deep inelastic cross sections previously published by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at HERA for neutral and charged current  scattering for zero beam polarisation. The data were taken at proton beam energies of 920, 820, 575 and 460 GeV and an electron beam energy of 27.5 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 1 fb and span six orders of magnitude in negative four-momentum-transfer squared, , and Bjorken x. The correlations of the systematic uncertainties were evaluated and taken into account for the combination. The combined cross sections were input to QCD analyses at leading order, next-to-leading order and at next-to-next-to-leading order, providing a new set of parton distribution functions, called HERAPDF2.0. In addition to the experimental uncertainties, model and parameterisation uncertainties were assessed for \u2026",
