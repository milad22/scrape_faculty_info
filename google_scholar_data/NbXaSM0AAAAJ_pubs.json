            "This document describes the technical layout and the expected performance of the Straw Tube Tracker (STT), the main tracking detector of the ANDA target spectrometer. The STT encloses a Micro-Vertex-Detector (MVD) for the inner tracking and is followed in beam direction by a set of GEM stations. The tasks of the STT are the measurement of the particle momentum from the reconstructed trajectory and the measurement of the specific energy loss for a particle identification. Dedicated simulations with full analysis studies of certain proton-antiproton reactions, identified as being benchmark tests for the whole ANDA scientific program, have been performed to test the STT layout and performance. The results are presented, and the time lines to construct the STT are described.",

            "Microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs are the favored photon sensors for the DIRC detectors of the PANDA experiment at FAIR. Until recently the main drawback of MCP-PMTs were serious aging effects which led to a limited lifetime due to a rapidly decreasing quantum efficiency (QE) of the photo cathode (PC) as the integrated anode charge (IAC) increased. In the latest models of PHOTONIS and Hamamatsu an innovative atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is applied to overcome these limitations. During the last five years comprehensive aging tests with ALD coated MCP-PMTs were performed and the results were compared to tubes treated with other techniques. The QE in dependence of the IAC was measured as a function of the wavelength and the position across the PC. For the best performing tubes the lifetime improvement in comparison to the older MCP-PMTs is a factor of> 50 based on an IAC of \u2026",

By applying innovative countermeasures against the aging causes, the manufacturers recently succeeded in drastically improving the lifetime of MCP-PMTs. Especially the application of an ALD coating technique to seal the material of the micro-channels proves very powerful and results in a lifetime of\u2248 6 C\/cm 2 integrated anode charge without a substantial QE degradation for the latest PHOTONIS XP85112.

            "The aim of this research is to develop a planar DIRC detector showing advantages and performance similar to a classical, barrel shaped DIRC, but at smaller polar angles which cannot be accessed using a cylindrical geometry. The device will complement the PANDA Barrel DIRC by covering polar angles from 5\u00b0 to 22\u00b0. The envisaged \u03c0\/K-separation is\u2265 3 \u03c3 up to 4 GeV\/c. A major challenge is the adaption of the device to the PANDA environment including a magnetic field of~ 1\u20132 T, high rates and radiation, limited space for optics and sensors as well as the lack of a common first-level trigger. This paper discusses a detector design which forms a compromise between these constraints and available hardware, a specific analytic reconstruction method, a performance estimation based on Geant4 simulations and finally the successful particle identification using a recent R&D prototype.",

            "The Endcap Disc DIRC (EDD) for PANDA has been designed to identify traversing pions, kaons and protons in the future PANDA experiment. Its central part is a 2 cm thick fused silica plate. Focussing optics are attached to the outer rim of the plate, outside of the acceptance of the experiment. Fast, high-resolution MCP-PMTs, designed to register single Cherenkov photons, have been tested in magnetic field. Filters limit the spectral acceptance of the sensors to reduce dispersion effects and to extend their lifetime. A compact and fast readout is realized with ASICs. Analytical reconstruction algorithms allow for fast particle identification. The angular resolution of a DIRC prototype has been simulated in Monte Carlo and confirmed in a test beam. The final detector will be able to provide a 4 \u03c3 \u03c0\/K separation up to a momentum of 4 GeV\/c.",

To optimize the performance and reduce the detector cost, detailed simulations of different design elements, such as the width of the radiators, the shape of the expansion volume, and the type of focusing system, were performed using Geant. Custom reconstruction algorithms were developed to match the detector geometry. We will discuss the single photon resolution and photon yield as well as the PID performance for the Barrel DIRC baseline design and several detector design options.",
