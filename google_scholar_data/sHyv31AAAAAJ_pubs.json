            "Worldwide, some 240 million people have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), with the highest rates of infection in Africa and Asia. Our understanding of the natural history of HBV infection and the potential for therapy of the resultant disease is continuously improving. New data have become available since the previous APASL guidelines for management of HBV infection were published in 2012. The objective of this manuscript is to update the recommendations for the optimal management of chronic HBV infection. The 2015 guidelines were developed by a panel of Asian experts chosen by the APASL. The clinical practice guidelines are based on evidence from existing publications or, if evidence was unavailable, on the experts\u2019 personal experience and opinion after deliberations. Manuscripts and abstracts of important meetings published through January 2015 have been evaluated. This guideline covers \u2026",

More recent data confirm that NAFLD and NASH play an equally important role in the Middle East, Far East, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America.

A subgroup of NAFLD patients displays liver cell injury and inflammation in addition to excessive fat (steatohepatitis).

The first of these consensuses has been developed on extra\u2010hepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO). It was discussed and prepared by the experts in this field from the Asian region and was presented at the annual meeting of the APASL, at Bali in August 2005. This article summarizes all the consensus statements approved by the APASL on various aspects of EHPVO.",
