            "The field of superconductivity has tremendous potential for growth and further development in industrial applications. The subject continues to occupy physicists, chemists, and engineers interested in both the phenomena itself and possible financially viable industrial devices utilizing the physical concepts. For the past five years, within the publications of the American Physical Society, for example, 40%-60% of all articles submitted to major journals in the area of Solid State Physics have been on the subject of superconductivity, including the newer, extremely important subfield of high temperature superconductivity (high Tc). The present volume is the first handbook to address this field. It covers both\" classic\" superconductivity-related topics and high Tc. Numerous properties, including thermal, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, phase diagrams, and spectroscopic crystallographic structures are presented for many types of superconductors. Critical fields, critical currents, coherence lengths, penetration depths, and transition temperatures are tabulated. First handbook on Superconductivity Coherence lengths and depths are tabulated Crystallographic structures of over 100 superconductor types Main results of several theories are submitted Phase diagrams for synthesizing new superconductors are included",

            "This topical review summarizes various features of magnetic penetration depth in unconventional superconductors. Precise measurements of the penetration depth as a function of temperature, magnetic field and crystal orientation can provide detailed information about the pairing state. Examples are given of unconventional pairing in hole-and electron-doped cuprates, organic and heavy fermion superconductors. The ability to apply an external magnetic field adds a new dimension to measurements of penetration depth. We discuss how field-dependent measurements can be used to study surface Andreev bound states, nonlinear Meissner effects, magnetic impurities, magnetic ordering, proximity effects and vortex motion. We also discuss how measurements of penetration depth as a function of orientation can be used to explore superconductors with more than one gap and with anisotropic gaps. Details relevant \u2026",

Below T TO the free standing crystals split into equally populated structural domains, which mask intrinsic, in-plane, anisotropic properties of the materials. Here we demonstrate a way of mechanically detwinning CaFe 2 As 2 and BaFe 2 As 2. The detwinning is nearly complete, as demonstrated by polarized light imaging and synchrotron x-ray measurements, and reversible, with twin pattern restored after strain release. Electrical resistivity measurements in the twinned and detwinned states show that resistivity, \u03c1, decreases along the orthorhombic a o axis but increases along the orthorhombic b o axis in both compounds.

            "Recently spin textures called skyrmions have been discovered in certain chiral magnetic materials without spatial inversion symmetry, and they have attracted enormous attention due to their promising application in spintronics since only a low applied current is necessary to drive their motion. When a conduction electron moves around the skyrmion, its spin is fully polarized by the spin texture and acquires a quantized phase; thus, the skyrmion yields an emergent electrodynamics that in turn determines skyrmion motion and gives rise to a finite Hall angle. As topological excitations, skyrmions behave as particles. In this paper we derive the equation of motion for skyrmions as rigid point particles from a microscopic continuum model and obtain the short-range interaction between skyrmions and the interaction between skyrmions and defects. Skyrmions also experience a Magnus force perpendicular to their velocity \u2026",

            "Anisotropies of electrical resistivity, upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical currents have been measured in single crystals of the optimally doped iron pnictide superconductor Ba (Fe 1\u2212 x Co x) 2 As 2 (x= 0.074 and T c\u223c 23 K). The normal-state resistivity anisotropy was obtained by employing both the Montgomery technique and direct measurements on samples cut along principal crystallographic directions. The ratio \u03b3 \u03c1= \u03c1 c\/\u03c1 a is about 4\u00b11 just above T c and becomes half of that at room temperature. The anisotropy of the upper critical field, \u03b3 H= H c 2, a b\/H c 2, c, as determined from specific-heat measurements close to T c is in the range of 2.1\u20132.6, depending on the criterion used. A comparable low anisotropy of the London penetration depth, \u03b3 \u03bb= \u03bb c\/\u03bb a b, was recorded from tunnel diode resonator measurements and found to persist deep into the superconducting state.
