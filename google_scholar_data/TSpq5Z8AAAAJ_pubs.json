            "Aggregates (sand, gravel, and crushed stone) are low unit-cost products extracted in very large volumes for the construction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure essential to modern society. Because of their low unit value, transportation costs are a key factor in resource economics, and deposits are commonly developed close to market (i.e., close to towns and cities, or along low-cost transportation corridors). This proximity results in potential conflict with residents over land use, disturbance, and pollution. Management of aggregate resources in Alberta is examined in the light of resource geology and distribution, and governance. A case history of development of the Calahoo-Villeneuve deposit is described, and the conflicts between residents and developers that led to establishment of an Area Structure Plan (ASP) are explored. The plan sets limits to, but at the same time safeguards, resource extraction \u2026",
