Thus, their composite nature provides insight into the AGN-starburst connection.

We examine the host morphologies and model the separate bulge and disk components. The HST\/ACS-F606W images reveal an equal number of spiral (13\/29) and early-type (13\/29) hosts, with the remaining three hosts having indeterminate classifications.

The central feature of this course is a focus on sense-making by the students during the 5\u2009h per week discussion\/labs in which the students take part in activities emphasizing peer-peer discussions, argumentation, and presentations of ideas. The course differs in many fundamental ways from traditionally taught introductory physics courses. After discussing the unique features of CLASP and its implementation at UC Davis, various student outcome measures are presented that show increased performance by students who took the CLASP course compared to students who took a traditionally taught introductory physics course. Measures we use include upper-division GPAs, MCAT scores, FCI gains, and MPEX-II scores.",

In this article we describe the observable features found in 17 evidence-based, active, science instructional practices to address the discrepancy between the effectiveness of these practices and instructors' willingness to use them. We assert that if university science instructors are aware of the observable features found in evidence-based practices, they would be better positioned to use these features in their teaching. Further, we hope that personal exploration of the observable features found in active practices will provide a foundation for an in-depth analysis of research and theory that supports student learning.

Our selection criteria require that the spectra display both the broad emission lines of luminous AGNs (Seyfert galaxies or quasars) and the Balmer jumps and high-order Balmer absorption lines of massive stellar populations on order of hundreds of mega-years old. This catalog will help us determine the relationship of post-starburst quasars to normal quasars, and help us refine the selection in the future into a more homogeneous and scientifically significant class.

Two relatively common numerical scales used to specify individual grades are the 4-point scale (where each whole number 0\u20134 corresponds to a letter grade) and the percent scale (where letter grades A through D are uniformly distributed in the top 40% of the scale). This paper uses grading data from a single series of courses offered over a period of 10 years to show that the grade distributions emerging from these two grade scales differed in many ways from each other. Evidence suggests that the differences are due more to the grade scale than to either the students or the instructors.
