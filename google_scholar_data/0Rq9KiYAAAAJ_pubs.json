Images of a cloud of 7\u2212 \u03bc m\" dust\" particles, which are charged and levitated in a weakly ionized argon plasma, reveal a hexagonal crystal structure. The crystal is visible to the unaided eye. The particles are cooled by neutral gas to 310 K, and their charge is> 9800 e, corresponding to a Coulomb coupling parameter \u0393> 20 700. For such a large \u0393 value, strongly coupled plasma theory predicts that the particles should organize in a Coulomb solid, in agreement with our observations.",

            "Several models that predict the charge of particles in a plasma are reviewed. The simplest is based on orbit-limited probe theory. This basic model can be improved by adding several effects: charge reduction at high dust densities, electron emission, ion trapping and fluctuations. The charge is reduced at high dust densities, when a significant fraction of the charge in the plasma resides on the particles, depleting the plasma. Electron emission due to electron impact or ultraviolet exposure can cause a particle to have a positive charge, which has useful implications for plasma processing, since particles are confined in a discharge only if they have a negative charge. Ion trapping occurs due to ion-neutral collisions within the attractive Debye sphere of a negatively charged particle. Trapped ions reduce the net electric force on a particle. A particle's charge fluctuates because the currents collected from the plasma \u2026",

A filamentary mode appeared abruptly, and later a great void mode developed as a dust-free region with an intense glow inside and a sharp boundary outside. These modes were characterized by two-dimensional laser light scattering, video imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, Langmuir probe measurements, and Fourier analysis of the fluctuation spectrum. Dust growth was measured by electron microscopy and optical extinction, yielding the dust particle size and dust number density.

The ion drag force is driven by a flow of ions outward from an ionization source and toward the surrounding dust cloud, which has a negative space charge. In equilibrium the force balance for dust particles requires that the boundary with the dust cloud be sharp, provided that the particles are cold and monodispersive.

Selwyn found that particles actually formed and grew in the gas phase (see box 1), aggregating material from gases that were thought to have been exhausted by the vacuum pump. Then, at the fateful moment when the plasma-generating RF power was switched off, the particles fell and contaminated the wafer. Selwyn\u2019s discovery revealed that much of the particle contamination responsible for costly yield losses was happening not just anywhere in the clean rooms, but inside the plasma reactors.Whereas a dusty plasma is something of enduring interest to an astronomer, it was a vexing problem to be avoided by the semiconductor manufacturer. Nevertheless, the two communities suddenly found common ground. Both needed to understand the charging mechanisms and the forces that transport \u2026",

            "A dust grain in a plasma acquires an electric charge by collecting electron and ion currents. These currents consist of discrete charges, causing the charge to fluctuate around an equilibrium value \/spl lang\/Q\/spl rang\/. Electrons and ions are collected at random intervals and in a random sequence, with probabilities that depend on the grain's potential. We developed a model for these probabilities and implemented it in a numerical simulation of the collection of individual ions and electrons, yielding a time series Q(t) for the grain's charge. Electron emission from the grain is not included, although it could be added easily to our method. We obtained the power spectrum and the RMS fluctuation level, as well as the distribution function of the charge. Most of the power in the spectrum lies at frequencies much lower than 1\/\/spl tau\/, the inverse charging time. The RMS fractional fluctuation level varies as 0.5 \/spl verbar\/\/spl \u2026",
