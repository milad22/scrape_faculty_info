            "Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures of WS 2\/MoS 2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS 2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS 2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS 2 on MoS 2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that \u2026",

First, we employ Raman spectroscopy to observe phonon softening with increased strain, breaking the degeneracy in the E\u2032 Raman mode of MoS2, and extract a Gru\u0308neisen parameter of \u223c1.06. Second, using photoluminescence spectroscopy we measure a decrease in the optical band gap of MoS2 that is approximately linear with strain, \u223c45 meV\/% strain for monolayer MoS2 and \u223c120 meV\/% strain for bilayer MoS2. Third, we observe a pronounced strain-induced decrease in the photoluminescence intensity of monolayer MoS2 that is indicative of the direct-to-indirect transition of the character of the optical band gap of this material at applied strain of \u223c1%.

Transmission electron microscopy should in principle be able to fulfil this role, as many scientists including Feynman realized early on 1. It images matter with electrons that scatter strongly from individual atoms and whose wavelengths are about 50 times smaller than an atom. Recently the technique has advanced greatly owing to the introduction of aberration-corrected optics 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. However, neither electron microscopy nor any other experimental technique has yet been able to resolve and identify all the atoms in a non-periodic material consisting of several atomic species.

However, the efficiency of hydrogen production is limited by the amount of active sites, for example, edges, in MoS2. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen plasma exposure and hydrogen treatment on pristine monolayer MoS2 could introduce more active sites via the formation of defects within the monolayer, leading to a high density of exposed edges and a significant improvement of the hydrogen evolution activity. These as-fabricated defects are characterized at the scale from macroscopic continuum to discrete atoms. Our work represents a facile method to increase the hydrogen production in electrochemical reaction of MoS2 via defect engineering, and helps to understand the catalytic properties of MoS2.",

Stable sites, migration paths, and barriers for different charge states are explored and displayed in total-energy surfaces that provide immediate insight into these properties. The bond-center site is the global minimum for the neutral and positive charge states; in the negative charge state, the tetrahedral interstitial site is preferred. The positive charge state is energetically favorable in p-type material, providing a mechanism for passivation of shallow acceptors: electrons from the H atoms annihilate the free holes, and formation of H-acceptor pairs follows compensation.

Annealing in nitric oxide after a standard oxidation\/reoxidation process results in a slight increase in the defect state density in the lower portion of the band gap for p-SiC and a significant decrease in the density of states in the upper half of the gap for n-SiC. Theoretical calculations provide an explanation for these results in terms of N passivating C and C clusters at the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface.",

            "Theoretical work has so far focused on the role of host-element chemical potentials in determining defect formation energies that control doping levels in semiconductors. Here, we report on our analysis of the role of the dopant-impurity chemical potential, which depends on the source gas. We present first-principles total-energy calculations that demonstrate a wide variation in the possible effective chemical potential of N. We account in detail for the recent puzzling observations of doping ZnO using N 2 and N 2 O and predict that the use of dilute NO or NO 2 gas would resolve the long-standing problem of achieving p-type ZnO.",
