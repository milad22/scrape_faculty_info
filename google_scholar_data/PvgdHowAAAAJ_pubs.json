Quantum-chemical calculations at the density functional theory level predict that the Alq3 radical anion is formed upon reaction with the alkali metals. In this case, up to three metal atoms can react with a given Alq3 molecule to form the trivalent anion. The anion formation results in a splitting of the N\u200a1s core level and formation of a new feature in the previously forbidden energy gap. Virtually identical spectra are observed in the Al\/LiF\/Alq3 system, leading to the conclusion that the radical anion is also formed when all three of these constituents are present.

            "Organolead trihalide perovskites are emerging excellent active materials for thin film solar cells. Here, the formation and evolution of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite thin films grown by the low-temperature thermal annealing induced interdiffusion process are investigated. It is found that thermal annealing not only drives the formation of perovskite but also affects the morphology, optoelectronic properties and correlated device performance. Thermal annealing at 105 \u00b0C quickly drives the formation of phase-pure perovskite in a short time of 15 min, and continued thermal annealing up to two hours continuously increases the perovskite crystallinity and grain size without losing film continuity or coverage. The measured Hall mobility increases monotonically to 36.0 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 upon annealing, which is correlated with the increased crystallinity and grain size. Device efficiencies increase with an increased \u2026",
