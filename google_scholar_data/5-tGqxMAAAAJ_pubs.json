            "Phytochromes are a family of plant photoreceptors that mediate physiological and developmental responses to changes in red and far-red light conditions. In Arabidopsis, there are genes for at least five phytochrome proteins. These photoreceptors control such responses as germination, stem elongation, flowering, gene expression, and chloroplast and leaf development. However, it is not known which red light responses are controlled by which phytochrome species, or whether the different phytochromes have overlapping functions. We report here that previously described hy3 mutants have mutations in the gene coding for phytochrome B (PhyB). These are the first mutations shown to lie in a plant photoreceptor gene. A number of tissues are abnormally elongated in the hy3(phyB) mutants, including hypocotyls, stems, petioles, and root hairs. In addition, the mutants flower earlier than the wild type, and they \u2026",

            "Dramatic advances in our understanding of auxin signal-response pathways have been made in recent years. Much of this new knowledge has come through the study of mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations have been identified in a wide variety of auxin-response components, including auxin transporters, protein kinases and phosphatases, components of a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, and transcriptional regulators. This review focuses on mutations that affect auxin-modulated transcription factors, in particular those in the Aux\/IAA and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR(ARF) genes. Mutants in members of these related gene families exhibit phenotypes that indicate both unique localized functions, as well as overlapping redundant functions, throughout plant development \u2013 from embryogenesis to flowering.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are genes encoding at least five phytochromes, and it is of interest to learn if the different phytochromes have overlapping or distinct functions. To address this question for two of the phytochromes in Arabidopsis, we have compared light responses of the wild type with those of a phyA null mutant, a phyB null mutant, and a phyA phyB double mutant. We have found that both phyA and phyB mutants have a deficiency in germination, the phyA mutant in far-red light and the phyB mutant in the dark. Furthermore, the germination defect caused by the phyA mutation in far-red light could be suppressed by a phyB mutation, suggesting that phytochrome B (PHYB) can have an inhibitory as well as a stimulatory effect on germination. In red light, the phyA phyB double mutant, but neither single \u2026",

Wild-type pollen grew poorly in arf6 arf8 gynoecia, correlating with ARF6 and ARF8 expression in style and transmitting tract. ARF6 and ARF8 transcripts are cleavage targets of the microRNA miR167, and overexpressing miR167 mimicked arf6 arf8 phenotypes. Mutations in the miR167 target sites of ARF6 or ARF8 caused ectopic expression of these genes in domains of both ovules and anthers where miR167 was normally present. As a result, ovule integuments had arrested growth, and anthers grew abnormally and failed to \u2026",

Numerous developmentally regulated genes failed to be induced. ARF6 and ARF8 thus coordinate the transition from immature to mature fertile flowers.

Dominant shy2 mutations cause amino acid changes in domain II, conserved among all members of this family. We isolated loss-of-function shy2 alleles including a putative null mutation. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function shy2 mutations affect auxin-dependent root growth, lateral root formation, and timing of gravitropism, indicating that SHY2\/IAA3 regulates multiple auxin responses in roots.

            "Phytochrome, a red\/far-red-light photoreceptor protein of plants, is encoded by a small gene family. Phytochrome A (PHYA), the product of the PHYA gene, is the predominant molecular species of phytochrome in etiolated tissue and has been best characterized biochemically. To define a role for PHYA, we isolated new mutants, designated fre1 (far-red elongated), in Arabidopsis thaliana that were specifically deficient in PHYA spectral activity and protein accumulation. These mutants were identified on the basis of their long hypocotyl phenotype under continuous far-red light. Although the fre1 mutants lacked the hypocotyl response to continuous far-red light, their responses to continuous white light and to end-of-day far-red-light treatments were normal. Thus, PHYA appears to play only a minor role in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation under natural conditions. In contrast, the fre1 mutation affected greening a \u2026",

            "The dominant gain-of-function axr2-1 mutation of Arabidopsis causes agravitropic root and shoot growth, a short hypocotyl and stem, and auxin-resistant root growth. We have cloned theAXR2 gene using a map-based approach, and find that it is the same as IAA7, a member of the IAA(indole-3-acetic acid) family of auxin-inducible genes. Theaxr2-1 mutation changes a single amino acid in conserved domain II of AXR2\/IAA7. We isolated loss-of-function mutations inAXR2\/IAA7 as intragenic suppressors ofaxr2-1 or in a screen for insertion mutations inIAA genes. A null mutant has a slightly longer hypocotyl than wild-type plants, indicating that AXR2\/IAA7 controls development in light-grown seedlings, perhaps in concert with other gene products. Dark-grown axr2-1 mutant plants have short hypocotyls and make leaves, suggesting that activation of AXR2\/IAA7 is sufficient to induce morphological responses normally \u2026",
