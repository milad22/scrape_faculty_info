We show that the spectra are well described in a shakeup picture in third-order perturbation theory which exhibits both incoming and outgoing resonances and demonstrate how to extract a spectral function from the raw data. We conclude by showing q-dependent measurements of the charge transfer gap.",

These data reveal two peaks, both of which show two-dimensional characteristics. The lowest energy excitation has a gap energy of\u223c 2.2 e V at the zone enter, and a dispersion of\u223c 1 e V. The spectral weight of this mode becomes dramatically smaller around (\u03c0, \u03c0). The second peak shows a smaller dispersion (\u223c 0.5 e V) with a zone-center energy of\u223c 3.9 e V.

However, the nature of the CDW ground state has remained uncertain because disorder and the presence of superconductivity typically limit the CDW correlation lengths to only a dozen unit cells or less. Here we explore the field-induced 3D CDW correlations in extremely pure detwinned crystals of YBa2Cu3O2 (YBCO) ortho-II and ortho-VIII at magnetic fields in excess of the resistive upper critical field () where superconductivity is heavily suppressed. We observe that the 3D CDW is unidirectional and possesses a long in-plane correlation length as well as significant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes. It is significant that we observe only a single sharply defined transition at a critical field proportional to , given that the field range used in this investigation overlaps with other high \u2026",

In recent years, it was shown that in 1+ 1 D bosonic systems, there is no nontrivial topological order, while in 2+ 1 D bosonic systems, the topological orders are classified by the following pair: a modular tensor category and a chiral central charge. In this paper, following a new line of thinking, we find that in 3+ 1 D the classification is much simpler than it was thought to be; we propose a partial classification of topological orders for 3+ 1 D bosonic systems: If all the pointlike excitations are bosons, then such topological orders are classified by a simpler pair (G, \u03c9 4): a finite group G and its group 4-cocycle \u03c9 4\u2208 H 4 [G; U (1)](up to group automorphisms). Furthermore, all such 3+ 1 D topological orders can be realized by Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories.",

            "We report synchrotron x-ray-diffraction measurements on low-density hcp-solid 4 He at a temperature of\u223c 0.7 K. The root-mean-square deviation of the atoms from their lattice positions< u 2> 1\/2 is determined from measurements of the Debye-Waller factor at the (002),(004), and (006) Bragg peaks. We find< u 2> 1\/2= 0.96\u00b10.02 \u212b along the c axis. Our results are consistent with Green's function\u2013Monte Carlo calculations. Weak reflections at the hcp-forbidden (001) and (003) Bragg peaks were also observed, probably indicating structural defects in the crystals.",
