The cross section exhibits an abrupt decrease at extreme sub-barrier energies. This behavior, which is also present in a few other systems found in the literature, cannot be reproduced with present models, including those based on a coupled-channels approach.

The influence on the efficiency of cross talk, neutron-gamma and neutron-charged particle discrimination techniques was found to be negligibly small. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed and are compared with the experimental data. The relative weight of the interaction channel 12C(n,n\u2032\u03b3) in the organic liquid scintillator was determined experimentally.

Results are in a range of 225\u2013400 kyr with error bars in the order of 15% primarily due to counting statistics in the cyclotron accelerator mass spectrometer measurement. Additional uncertainties from subsurface production and\/or exchange with stagnant porewaters in the confining shales appear to be of the same order of magnitude.

Thus, this system exhibits a hindrance for fusion, a phenomenon that has been discovered only recently. In the S-factor representation introduced to quantify the hindrance, a maximum is observed at E s= 120. 6 MeV, which corresponds to 90% of the reference energy E s ref, a value expected from systematics of closed-shell systems.

In this paper, we report on the first use of 81Kr to determine the age of groundwater from four wells in the Great Artesian Basin in Australia. As the concentration of 81Kr in old groundwater is only a few hundred atoms per liter, krypton was extracted from large (16\u2008000 l) groundwater samples and was analyzed for the isotopic abundance of 81Kr by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) with a cyclotron. 81Kr\/Kr isotope ratios of (1.54\u00b10.22)\u00d710\u221213, (1.78\u00b10.26)\u00d710\u221213, (2.19\u00b10.28)\u00d710\u221213 and (2.63\u00b10.32)\u00d710\u221213, respectively, were measured for these samples.

            "Trace analysis of radionuclides is an essential and versatile tool in modern science and technology. Due to their ideal geophysical and geochemical properties, long-lived noble gas radionuclides, in particular, 39Ar (t1\/2= 269 yr), 81Kr (t1\/2= 2.3 x10^ 5 yr) and 85Kr (t1\/2= 10.8 yr), have long been recognized to have a wide range of important applications in Earth sciences. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of practical analytical methods, and has led to applications of these isotopes in the hydrosphere (tracing the flow of groundwater and ocean water). In this article, we introduce the applications of these isotopes and review three leading analytical methods: Low-Level Counting (LLC), Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) and Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA).",

            "We report on the first measurement of 39 Ar in argon from underground natural gas reservoirs. The gas stored in the US National Helium Reserve was found to contain a low level of 39 Ar. The ratio of 39 Ar to stable argon was measured to be\u2a7d 4\u00d7 10-17 (84% CL), less than 5% the value in atmospheric argon (39 Ar\/Ar= 8\u00d7 10-16). The total quantity of argon currently stored in the National Helium Reserve is estimated at 1000 tons. 39 Ar represents one of the most important backgrounds in argon detectors for WIMP dark matter searches. The findings reported demonstrate the possibility of constructing large multi-ton argon detectors with low radioactivity suitable for WIMP dark matter searches.",
