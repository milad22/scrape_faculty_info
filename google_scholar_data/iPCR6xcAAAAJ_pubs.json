            "The use of octadecylamine modified montmorillonite as substitute of carbon black in natural rubber (NR) compounds is studied. Rubber with 10 parts per hundred resin (phr) of pristine (clay) and octadecylamine modified montmorillonite (organoclay) were compared with 10 and 40 phr carbon black as filler. The modified silicate is analysed by X-ray, FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis. Vulcametric curves show that the organoclay and carbon black accelerate the vulcanization reaction and, furthermore, give rise to a marked increase in the torque, indicating a higher degree of crosslinking as was also confirmed by swelling measurements and DSC. The vulcanisation rate and torque value of the organoclay compound are sensibly higher than the carbon black compound even at high contents (40 phr). Mechanical characterization shows the strong reinforcing effect of both fillers up to 350% in the strength in relation \u2026",

The tensile mechanical properties showed that Young\u2019s modulus and tensile strength considerably increase in the presence of nanotubes, with a maximum for 0.75 wt%. The reinforcing effect of SWNTs was also confirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis where, by adding nanotubes, a noticeable increase in the storage modulus was detected.

It was observed that the differences in the structure of the resultant graphite oxides (GOs) greatly affect the structure of the graphenes resulting from their thermal exfoliation\/reduction. Although the oxidation of the graphite was more effective with the modified Hummers method than with Brodie\u2019s method (C\/O of 1.8 vs 2.9, as determined by XPS), the former generated a lower residual oxygen content after thermal exfoliation\/reduction and a better reconstruction of the 2D graphene structure (with fewer defects). This is explained by the presence of conjugated epoxy and hydroxyl groups in the GO obtained by Brodie\u2019s method, which upon thermal treatment, lead to the incorporation of oxygen into the carbon lattice preventing its complete restoration \u2026",

Although the octadecylamine itself accelerated the vulcanization process, the octadecylamine\u2010modified clay gave rise to a further noticeable increase in the vulcanization rate, which could be attributed to a synergetic effect between the filler and the amine.

The rubber phase was uniformly dispersed in the continuous PLA matrix with a droplet size range from 1.1 to 2.0 \u03bcm. The ductility of PLA has been significantly improved by blending with natural rubber, NR. The elongation at break improved from 5% for neat PLA to 200% by adding 10 wt% NR. In addition, the incorporation of NR not only increased the crystallisation rate but also enhanced the crystallisation ability of PLA.

Initial studies concentrated mainly on dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) and identified the electro-mechanical principles and material requirements for an optimal performance. Those requirements include the need for polymers with high dielectric permittivity and stretchability and low dielectric loss and viscoelastic damping.

We found that FGS did not raise the viscosity of the system as much as MWCNT, maintaining the Newtonian behavior even at 1.5 wt.% FGS. MWCNT readily formed a filler network compared to FGS, evidenced by lower electrical and rheological percolation thresholds, presence of yield stress and higher storage modulus of the dispersions. On the other hand, the mechanical performance of the cured FGS nanocomposites outperformed the MWCNT, with enhancements of 50% and 15% of Young\u2019s modulus and strength, respectively.
