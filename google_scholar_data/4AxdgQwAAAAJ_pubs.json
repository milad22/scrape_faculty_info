            "The isolation of graphene in 2004 from graphite was a defining moment for the \u201cbirth\u201d of a field: two-dimensional (2D) materials. In recent years, there has been a rapidly increasing number of papers focusing on non-graphene layered materials, including transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), because of the new properties and applications that emerge upon 2D confinement. Here, we review significant recent advances and important new developments in 2D materials \u201cbeyond graphene\u201d. We provide insight into the theoretical modeling and understanding of the van der Waals (vdW) forces that hold together the 2D layers in bulk solids, as well as their excitonic properties and growth morphologies. Additionally, we highlight recent breakthroughs in TMD synthesis and characterization and discuss the newest families of 2D materials, including monoelement 2D materials (i.e., silicene, phosphorene, etc.) and \u2026",

The in-plane design is straightforward to implement and exploits efficiently the surface of each graphene layer for energy storage. The open architecture and the effect of graphene edges enable even the thinnest of devices, made from as grown 1\u22122 graphene layers, to reach specific capacities up to 80 \u03bcFcm\u22122, while much higher (394 \u03bcFcm\u22122) specific capacities are observed multilayer reduced graphene oxide electrodes.

Thus, it is important to control the morphology and crystallinity of these edges for practical purposes. We demonstrated an efficient edge-reconstruction process, at the atomic scale, for graphitic nanoribbons by Joule heating. During Joule heating and electron beam irradiation, carbon atoms are vaporized, and subsequently sharp edges and step-edge arrays are stabilized, mostly with either zigzag- or armchair-edge configurations. Model calculations show that the dominant annealing mechanisms involve point defect annealing and edge reconstruction.",

When the pore size is in the mesopore regime (2\u201350\u2005nm), counterions enter mesoporous carbon materials and approach the pore wall to form an electric double\u2010cylinder capacitor (EDCC); in the micropore regime (<2\u2005nm), solvated\/desolvated counterions line up along the pore axis to form an electric wire\u2010in\u2010cylinder capacitor (EWCC).

To develop supercapacitors as an alternative to batteries, currently intense research efforts aim at increasing the energy density by optimizing the pore size distribution of nanoporous carbon materials. In their breakthrough work, Gogotsi and co-workers [3] synthesized carbidederived carbons with unimodal micropores [4] smaller than 1nm, and found that these new materials exhibit an anomalous increase in capacitance compared to others with pore sizes above 2 nm. These results challenge the long-held presumption that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions do not contribute \u2026",

Deformations in nanotube structures lead to novel structural transformations, some of which have clear electrical signatures that can be utilized in nanoscale sensors and devices. Chemical reactivity of nanotube walls is facilitated by strain, which can be used in processing and functionalization.
