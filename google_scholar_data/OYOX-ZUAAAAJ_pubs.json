            "We propose that the enigmatic pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors is characterized by a hidden broken symmetry of d x 2\u2212 y 2-type. The transition to this state is rounded by disorder, but in the limit that the disorder is made sufficiently small, the pseudogap crossover should reveal itself to be such a transition. The ordered state breaks time-reversal, translational, and rotational symmetries, but it is invariant under the combination of any two. We discuss these ideas in the context of ten specific experimental properties of the cuprates, and make several predictions, including the existence of an as-yet undetected metal-metal transition under the superconducting dome.",

            "The Cooper pairing mechanism of heavy fermionsuperconductors 1, 2, 3, 4, long thought to be due to spin fluctuations 5, 6, 7, has not yet been determined. It is the momentum space (k-space) structure of the superconducting energy gap \u0394 (k) that encodes specifics of this pairing mechanism. However, because the energy scales are so low, it has not been possible to directly measure \u0394 (k) for any heavy fermion superconductor. Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging 8, a proven technique for measuring the energy gaps of superconductors with high critical temperatures 9, 10, 11, has recently been proposed 12 as a new method to measure \u0394 (k) in heavy fermion superconductors, specifically CeCoIn 5 (ref. 13). By implementing this method, we detect a superconducting energy gap whose nodes are oriented along k\u2225(\u00b11,\u00b11) \u03c0\/a 0 directions 14, 15, 16, 17.

            "Elementary analytical extremal statistics arguments are used to analyze the possibility of quantum Griffiths effects in nearly critical systems with overdamped dynamics, such as arise in conventional theories of metallic quantum criticality. The overdamping is found to strongly suppress quantum tunneling of rare regions, leading to superparamagnetic rather than quantum Griffiths behavior. Implications for theories of non-Fermi-liquid behavior in heavy-fermion materials are discussed.",
