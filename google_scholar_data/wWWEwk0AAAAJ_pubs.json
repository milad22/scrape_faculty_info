            "The new class of amplifiers described is based on a load network synthesized to have a transient response which maximizes power efficiency even if the active device switching times are substantial fractions of the a.c. cycle. The new class of amplifiers, named `Class E,' is defined and is illustrated by a detailed description and a set of design equations for one simple member of the class. For that circuit the authors measured 96 percent transistor efficiency at 3.9 MHz at 26-W output from a pair of Motorola 2N3735 TO-5 transistors. Advantages of Class E are unusually high efficiency, a priori designability, large reduction in second-breakdown stress, low sensitivity to active-device characteristics, and potential for high-efficiency operation at higher frequencies than previously published Class-D circuits.",

            "In 1996, Alan Sokal published an essay in the hip intellectual magazine Social Text parodying the scientific but impenetrable lingo of contemporary theorists. Here, Sokal teams up with Jean Bricmont to expose the abuse of scientific concepts in the writings of today's most fashionable postmodern thinkers. From Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva to Luce Irigaray and Jean Baudrillard, the authors document the errors made by some postmodernists using science to bolster their arguments and theories. Witty and closely reasoned, Fashionable Nonsense dispels the notion that scientific theories are mere\" narratives\" or social constructions, and explored the abilities and the limits of science to describe the conditions of existence.",

            "Au printemps 1996, une revue am\u00e9ricaine fort respect\u00e9e--Social Text--publiait un article au titre \u00e9trange:\" Transgresser les fronti\u00e8res: vers une herm\u00e9neutique transformative de la gravitation quantique.\" Son auteur, Alan Sokal, \u00e9tayait ses divagations par des citations d'intellectuels c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, fran\u00e7ais et am\u00e9ricains. Peu apr\u00e8s, il r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu'il s' agissait d'une parodie. Son but \u00e9tait de s' attaquer, par la satire, \u00e0 l'usage intempestif de terminologie scientifique et aux extrapolations abusives des sciences exactes aux sciences humaines. Plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, il voulait d\u00e9noncer le relativisme postmoderne pour lequel l'objectivit\u00e9 est une simple convention sociale. Ce canular a d\u00e9clench\u00e9 un vif d\u00e9bat dans les milieux intellectuels, en France et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. Dans ce livre, les auteurs ont rassembl\u00e9 et comment\u00e9 des textes illustrant les mystifications physico-math\u00e9matiques de Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, F\u00e9lix Guattari et Paul Virilio, auteurs qui jouissent tous d'une grande notori\u00e9t\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Ils montrent que, derri\u00e8re un jargon imposant et une \u00e9rudition scientifique apparente, le roi est nu. Alan Sokal est professeur de physique \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de New York. Jean Bricmont est professeur de physique th\u00e9orique \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Louvain.",

            "The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is| second only to American political campaigns| the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time.| Larry Laudan, Science and Relativism (1990)For some years I've been troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of intellectual rigor in certain precincts of the American academic humanities. But I'm a mere physicist: if I nd myself unable to make head or tail of jouissance and di erance, perhaps that just re ects my own inadequacy. So, to test the prevailing intellectual standards, I decided to try a modest (though admittedly uncontrolled) experiment: Would a leading North American journal of cultural studies| whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross| publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it attered the editors' ideological preconceptions?",
