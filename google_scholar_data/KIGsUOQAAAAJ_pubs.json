            "We demonstrate the inscription of fiber Bragg gratings by 193 nm ArF excimer laser in microfibers drawn from the standard single mode telecommunication fiber. Fiber Bragg gratings are directly inscribed in a series of microfibers with diameter ranged from tens of \u03bcm to 3.3 \u03bcm without hydrogen loading or other treatment to photosensitize the microfibers. Four reflection peaks are observed where three correspond to high order mode resonances. The resonance wavelength depends on the fiber diameter and it sharply blueshifts as the diameter is decreased below 10 \u03bcm. The gratings are characterized for their response to ambient refractive index. The higher order mode resonance exhibits higher sensitivity to refractive index.",

The measured sensitivity is as high as 18,987?nm\/RIU (refractive-index unit) around the RI of 1.33, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the previously reported microfiber devices. Theoretical analysis reveals that such high sensitivity not only is originated from the RI-induced birefringence variation but also relies on the unique birefringence dispersion property for the rectangular microfiber. We predict that the sensitivity can be enhanced significantly when the group birefringence approaches zero.",

A single straight Bragg grating inscribed in the silica microfiber provides two well-defined resonances in reflection, which show different response to external medium refractive index (RI) and present the same temperature sensitivity. By monitoring the wavelength separation between these two resonances, temperature-compensated RI measurement has been achieved. The label-free bio-recognition scheme used demonstrates that the sensor relies on the surface functionalization of a monolayer of poly-l-lysine (PLL), synthetic DNA sequences that bind with high specificity to a given target. In addition to monitoring the surface functionalization of the fiber in real-time, the results also show how the fiber biosensor can detect the \u2026",

Strong Bragg gratings are easily inscribed using a 193-nm excimer laser and phase mask in microfiber drawn from the 62.5\/125- \u03bcm standard multimode fiber (MMF) with no additional photosensitization treatment. The enlarged photosensitive core offered by the MMF provides a sufficient overlap between the fundamental mode and the induced refractive index modulation region, which significantly enhances the grating inscription efficiency. The grating inscription in the microfiber is even more efficient than that in the original MMF because the multibeam interference-induced fringe fuzziness in the normal size fiber does not occur as the fiber diameter down to the scale that is comparable with the Talbot length of the ultraviolet (UV)-writing light. The proposed method is beneficial for sensing and device applications of microfiber \u2026",

Interferometric fringe with visibility of around 30 dB can be achieved in the transmission spectrum due to phase difference between the two polarization modes travelling through the microfiber region. The proposed structure presents high sensitivity up to \u223c201.25 pm\/%RH, within an RH range from 30%RH to 90%RH. Moreover, we realize the sensitivity enhancement (up to \u223c422.2 pm\/%RH) by inserting a reference Panda fiber into the fiber loop. The sensitivity is two to five times of magnitude higher than the counterparts in the literature. The measured response time is around 60 ms, which is much better than the previously-reported devices.",

The grating has two Bragg peaks due to the high geometrical birefringence of the rectangular microfiber. The two peaks present different RI responses because the modes along the orthogonal polarizations have different energy fractions in terms of evanescent field outside the silica microfiber and hence the light\/liquid interaction strength are different. In contrast, they exhibit identical temperature sensitivities because most mode energy is confined in the microfiber and the thermal-optic effect of silica dominantly determines the temperature response. As a result, temperature-independent RI sensing can be realized by monitoring the wavelength separation between the two peaks.",
