            "Allelopathy has been hypothesized to promote the success of invasive plants. Support for the role of allelopathy in invasions has emerged from research on the candidate allelochemical (\u2212)\u2010catechin, which is secreted by spotted knapweed. Here we describe new methods to quantify catechin in liquid and soil. With a new technique, we assayed catechin production by individual plants in liquid media and found levels up to two orders of magnitude less than previously reported. An acetone\/water solution provided consistent recovery of catechin from soil, with percent recovery depending upon soil type. We evaluated soils from two spotted knapweed sites in Montana, USA, but found no measurable catechin. Idaho fescue, a native species reportedly sensitive to catechin, only exhibited slightly reduced growth at concentrations 10 times higher than previously reported to cause 100% mortality. Our results emphasize \u2026",

Similar to the situation in glyphosate-tolerant crops in other regions, glyphosate-based weed-management strategies in perennial crops and noncrop areas have resulted in selection of a glyphosate-resistant horseweed biotype in California. Research was conducted to determine the level of resistance to glyphosate in horseweed using an in vivo enzyme assay and to determine the distribution of the resistant horseweed biotype in central California. The resistant biotype was 4.8-fold more resistant to in vivo glyphosate exposure compared with the susceptible biotype, although enzyme function was inhibited in both biotypes at high glyphosate concentrations.

            "Preplant soil fumigation is an important pest management practice in coastal California strawberry production regions. Potential atmospheric emissions of fumigants from field treatment, however, have drawn intensive environmental and human health concerns; increasingly stringent regulations on fumigant use have spurred research on low\u2010emission application techniques. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of a new low\u2010permeability film, commonly known as totally impermeable film (TIF), on fumigant emissions and on fumigant distribution in soil. A 50\/50 mixture of 1,3\u2010dichloropropene (1,3\u2010D) and chloropicrin (CP) was shank\u2010applied at 314 kg ha\u22121 in two location\u2010separate field plots (0.4 ha each) in Ventura County, California, in fall 2009. One plot was surface\u2010covered with standard polyethylene (PE) film, and the other was covered with TIF immediately after fumigant application. Data \u2026",
