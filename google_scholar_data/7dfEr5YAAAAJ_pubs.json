            "We report the production of matter-wave solitons in an ultracold lithium-7 gas. The effective interaction between atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate is tuned with a Feshbach resonance from repulsive to attractive before release in a one-dimensional optical waveguide. Propagation of the soliton without dispersion over a macroscopic distance of 1.1 millimeter is observed. A simple theoretical model explains the stability region of the soliton. These matter-wave solitons open possibilities for future applications in coherent atom optics, atom interferometry, and atom transport.",

It serves as an introduction to the focus issue of New Journal of Physics on Cold and Ultracold Molecules and describes new prospects for fundamental research and technological development. Cold and ultracold molecules may revolutionize physical chemistry and few-body physics, provide techniques for probing new states of quantum matter, allow for precision measurements of both fundamental and applied interest, and enable quantum simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. Ultracold molecules offer promising applications such as new platforms for quantum computing, precise control of molecular dynamics, nanolithography and Bose-enhanced chemistry.

We report first results on elliptic flow of charged particles at midrapidity in Au+ Au collisions at s NN= 130 GeV using the STAR Time Projection Chamber at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The elliptic flow signal, v 2, averaged over transverse momentum, reaches values of about 6% for relatively peripheral collisions and decreases for the more central collisions. This can be interpreted as the observation of a higher degree of thermalization than at lower collision energies. Pseudorapidity and transverse momentum dependence of elliptic flow are also presented.",

The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a \u2026",

The rapidity density of negative hadrons scales with the number of participant nucleons for nuclear collisions, whereas their< p T> is independent of system size. The< p T> dependence upon particle mass and system size is consistent with larger transverse flow velocity at midrapidity for Pb+ Pb compared to S+ S central collisions.",

            "With its large acceptance and particle identification coverage the NA49 experiment (Fig. 1) can study hadron production in a wide range of high energy reactions [1]. Originally aimed at examining central Pb+Pb collisions for signatures of quark-gluon plasma formation, the scope of the experiment has been enhanced with a systematic study of impact parameter and projectile size dependence, as well as the inclusion of the more elementary p+p and p+A interactions. The question is: are predicted signals of the quark-gluon plasma observed and are there discontinuities which would support the concept of hadronic phase transition?",

In the limit of a sinusoidal potential our solutions model a quasi-one-dimensional dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a standing light wave. Provided that the ratio of the height of the variations of the condensate to its dc offset is small enough, both trivial phase and nontrivial phase solutions are shown to be stable. Recent developments allow for experimental investigation of these predictions.",

These regions have ring structures that depart from the usual honeycomb lattice, though each carbon atom still has three nearest neighbors. A set of stable domain structures is identified by using density functional theory, including blisters, ridges, ribbons, and metacrystals. All such structures are made solely out of carbon; the smallest encompasses just 16 atoms. Blisters, ridges, and metacrystals rise up out of the sheet, while ribbons remain flat. In the vicinity of vacancies, the reaction barriers to formation are sufficiently low that such defects could be synthesized through the thermally activated restructuring of coalesced adatoms.",
