            "Gold (I)-catalyzed carbon\u2013carbon bond-forming reactions continue to fascinate the synthetic community but are less well investigated than many conventional metal catalysts.[1] In many cases a cationic gold (I) species activates an unsaturated C\u00c0C bond and isomerizes or functionalizes it to build molecular complexity via reactive intermediates which include gold\u2013\u03c0 complexes, gold\u2013vinyl species, and gold\u2013carbene species. Support for these intermediates is mainly based on gold (I) organometallic chemistry, though computational studies and the isolation of proposed catalytic intermediates have been reported.[2\u20135] We report mechanistic studies on a seemingly simple gold (I)-catalyzed reaction and demonstrate the importance of dinuclear organometallic intermediates. Whereas similar dinuclear species have been postulated on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) studies,[5b] di-gold intermediates have \u2026",

Whilst a range of efficient catalyst systems have recently been reported, it is of note that nearly all of them require high temperatures and\/or powerful oxidants.[1] Indeed, the development of an effective catalytic protocol for carbonylation using CO by palladium (II)-mediated C\u00c0H activation has long been recognized as being difficult and only recently has the first example been reported.[2] Herein we report a room-temperature, ureadirected, palladium-catalyzed carbonylation that provides access to biologically and synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives and heterocycles under mild conditions.",
