            "Rydberg atoms with principal quantum number n\u2aa2 1 have exaggerated atomic properties including dipole-dipole interactions that scale as n 4 and radiative lifetimes that scale as n 3. It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The availability of a strong long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multiqubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many-body physics. The advances of the last decade are reviewed, covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of Rydberg-mediated quantum information processing.",

Blockade has been observed for electrons 1, 2, 3, photons 4 and cold atoms 5. Furthermore, dipolar interactions between highly excited atoms have been proposed as a mechanism for \u2018Rydberg blockade\u20196, 7, which might provide a novel approach to a number of quantum protocols 8, 9, 10, 11. Dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms were observed several decades ago 12 and have been studied recently in a many-body regime using cold atoms 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. However, to harness Rydberg blockade for controlled quantum dynamics, it is necessary to achieve strong interactions between single pairs of atoms. Here, we demonstrate that a single Rydberg-excited rubidium atom blocks excitation of a second \u2026",

We present a general analysis of how degeneracies affect the primary error sources in blockade experiments, emphasizing that blockade errors are sensitive primarily to the weakest possible atom-atom interactions between the degenerate states, not the mean interaction strength. We present explicit calculations of the van der Waals potentials in the limit where the fine-structure interaction is large compared to the atom-atom interactions. The results are presented for all potential angular momentum channels involving s, p, and d states. For most channels there are one or more combinations of Zeeman levels that have extremely small dipole-dipole interactions and are therefore poor candidates for \u2026",
