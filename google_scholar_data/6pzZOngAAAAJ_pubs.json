            "HIV infection is associated with immune dysfunction, perturbation of immune-cell subsets and opportunistic infections. CD161++CD8+ T cells are a tissue-infiltrating population that produce IL17A, IL22, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1, cytokines important in mucosal immunity. In adults they dominantly express the semi-invariant TCR V\u03b17.2, the canonical feature of mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and have been recently implicated in host defense against pathogens. We analyzed the frequency and function of CD161++\/MAIT cells in peripheral blood and tissue from patients with early stage or chronic-stage HIV infection. We show that the CD161++\/MAIT cell population is significantly decreased in early HIV infection and fails to recover despite otherwise successful treatment. We provide evidence that CD161++\/MAIT cells are not preferentially infected but may be depleted through diverse mechanisms including \u2026",

            "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms and infections that are frequent in immunocompromised patients. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa evades human complement attack by binding the human plasma regulators Factor H and Factor H-related protein-1 (FHR-1) to its surface. Factor H binds to intact bacteria via two sites that are located within short consensus repeat (SCR) domains 6\u20137 and 19\u201320, and FHR-1 binds within SCR domain 3\u20135. A P. aeruginosa Factor H binding protein was isolated using a Factor H affinity matrix, and was identified by mass spectrometry as the elongation factor Tuf. Factor H uses the same domains for binding to recombinant Tuf and to intact bacteria. Factor H bound to recombinant Tuf displayed cofactor activity for degradation of C3b. Similarly Factor H bound to intact P. aeruginosa showed complement \u2026",

            "Enterovirus infections, in particular those with Coxsackieviruses, have been linked to the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Although animal models have demonstrated that interferons (IFNs) regulate virus-induced T1D by acting directly on the beta cell, little is known on the human pancreatic islet response to IFNs. Here we show that human islet cells respond to IFNs by expressing signature genes of antiviral defense. We also demonstrate that they express three intracellular sensors for viral RNA, the toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene, the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5), which induce type I IFN production in infected cells. Finally, we show for the first time that the IFN-induced antiviral state provides human islets with a powerful protection from the replication of Coxsackievirus. This may be critical for beta cell survival and protection from virus \u2026",

The association of high CD161 expression with innate T-cell populations including MAIT cells is established. Here we show that CD161 is also expressed, at intermediate levels, on a prominent subset of polyclonal CD8+ T cells, including antiviral populations that display a memory phenotype. These memory CD161 int CD8+ T cells are enriched within the colon and express both CD103 and CD69, markers associated with tissue residence. Furthermore, this population was characterized by enhanced polyfunctionality, increased levels of cytotoxic mediators, and high expression of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (EOMES).

To study the contribution of the intracellular viral sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5) in the host immune response to Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) we infected C57BL\/6 and 129\/SvJ mice lacking mda-5. Mice deficient in MDA-5 showed a dramatically increased susceptibility to CVB3 infection. The loss of MDA-5 allowed the virus to replicate faster, resulting in increased liver and pancreas damage and heightened mortality. MDA-5 was not absolutely required for the induction of type 1 interferons (IFNs), but essential for the production of maximal levels of systemic IFN-\u03b1 early after infection. Taken together, our findings indicate that MDA-5 plays an important role in the host immune response to CVB3 by preventing early virus replication and limiting tissue pathology.",
