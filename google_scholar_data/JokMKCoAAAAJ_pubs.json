The room-temperature metallic phase of these chains undergoes a temperature-induced, reversible transition into a semiconducting phase. The 1D CDW along the chains is observed directly in real space by scanning tunneling microscopy at low temperature. The Fermi contours of the metallic phase measured by angle-resolved photoemission exhibit a perfect nesting predicting precisely the CDW periodicity.",

Accurate two-dimensional energy dispersion relations are reported for each surface state and are quantified in terms of effective masses at the surface Brillouin-zone center. The masses for the three metals are found to be remarkably similar when normalized to the effective mass of the lower edge of the bulk continuum. The decay length of the surface state wave function into the surface was determined for all three surfaces. These results are expressed in terms of an effective mass of the complex dispersion relation within the projected band gap. In accord with our previous results on the copper state, these effective masses are found to be anomalously \u2026",

            "Angle-resolved photoemission has become an indispensable tool for solid state and surface physicists and chemists. This book covers the underlying phenomenology of the technique, reviews its application to existing problems, and discusses future applications. The book is particularly timely given the significant improvements in experimental and theoretical methodology which have recently been or soon will be attained, namely, ultrahigh resolution studies using improved sources of synchrotron radiation, quasiparticle interpretation of measured dispersion relations and spectra, in situ growth of novel materials, etc. The technique has been applied predominantly to understand materials for which the one-electron paradigm is a reasonable approximation. Most chapters discuss this type of experiment: 2D and 3D states in metals and semiconductors, extrinsic states induced by adsorption, etc. Applications of the technique to materials where electron correlation plays a comparable role to that of solid state hybridization, ferro-and antiferromagnets, high Tc superconductors, etc. are rapidly growing in popularity. These areas are also discussed and a foundation is laid for further experiments in this direction. Almost all chapters contain comprehensive bibliographies and compendia of systems studied. The book has an extensive index which cross references applications and systems studied.",

            "Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the E (k\/sub\/\/\/) band structure are reported for 1T-TaS 2 and 2H-TaSe 2 at temperatures where commensurate CDWS are well developed. Empirical tight-binding calculations of the band structure in the presence of the experimentally known CDW superlattice are also reported. In the case of the square root 13* square root 13 CDW in 1T-TaS 2, experiment and theory both reveal a gross distortion of the band structure, in which the Ta-derived d band collapses into three sub-band manifolds separated by gaps. The thirteenth electron is predicted to reside in a conduction band only 50 meV wide, where it is susceptible to a Mott-Anderson transition. In the case of 2H-TaSe 2, additional peaks are seen in the ARPES data in the presence of the CDW, but the effects are too weak to distinguish between a band-structure distortion and weak Umklapp \u2026",

Excellent agreement of peak energies with predictions by Tong and Li was obtained for both the c (2\u00d7 2) and p (2\u00d7 2) structures, using the hollow-site geometry.

We observe 100% spin polarization of the surface states, with the spins aligned in the plane of the surface and oriented in a circular fashion relative to the S symmetry point. In contrast, no measurable polarization of nearby bulk states is observed.",
