But fluctuation theorems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences.

As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.",

Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by \u2026",

Theor. Phys. Suppl. 130, 29\u201344] proposed a general phenomenological framework, steady-state thermodynamics, encompassing nonequilibrium steady states and transitions between such states. In 2001, Hatano and Sasa [Hatano, T. & Sasa, S. (2001) Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3463\u20133466] derived a testable prediction of this theory. Specifically, they were able to show that the exponential average of Y, a quantity similar to a dissipated work, should be equal to zero for arbitrary transitions between nonequilibrium steady states, \u2013ln<e\u2013Y> = 0. We have tested this strong prediction by measuring the dissipation and fluctuations of microspheres optically driven through water. We have found that \u2013ln<e\u2013Y> \u2248 0 for three different \u2026",
