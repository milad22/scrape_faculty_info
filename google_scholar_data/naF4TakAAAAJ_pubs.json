            "This paper applies a zonal hybrid RANS\/LES framework to analyze supersonic combustion in a model scramjet combustor. The geometries and boundary conditions of model scramjet combustor are based on an experiment conducted at DLR, German Aerospace Center. This model scramjet combustor was designed to achieve free flight Mach number of 5.5 and total air temperature of 1500 K. Hydrogen at subcritical conditions and thermal\/catalytic cracked kerosene at supercritical conditions are injected as fuel. A surrogate of thermal\/catalytic cracked kerosene is composed of ethylene and methane in supercritical conditions. To remain consistent with the hydrogen-fueled case, the total equivalence ratio is set to 0.034 for both cases. The total equivalence ratio is quite small, so it is not induced flow separation in the combustor duct. The thermodynamic and transport properties of the supercritical thermal\/catalytic \u2026",

The three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations were solved numerically on a structural grid using finite volume methods. An in-house was developed. This code used a monotonic upstream-centered scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL) with an advection upstream splitting method by pressure weight function (AUSMPW+) for space. In addition, a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme was used with preconditioning for time integration. The geometries and boundary conditions of a scramjet combustor operated by DLR, a German aerospace center, were considered. The profiles of the lower wall pressure and axial velocity obtained from a time-averaged solution were compared with \u2026",

A single aluminum combustion model containing detailed aluminum combustion phenomena (melting, the heterogeneous surface reaction, alumina shell growth, combustion heat distribution, etc.) is suggested and applied to a three-dimensional, compressible CFD in-house code. High order space discretization and field variable interpolation for particle technics are employed to reduce grid dependency. Flame propagation is simulated in a slip-wall bounded open duct with well distributed aluminum particles in an O2\u2013N2 mixture. The flame structure shows a flame zone that is longer than the pre-heating zone. This is unlike a gas phase flame, and it is due to the long combustion time needed for solid particles. The temperature behaviors of the gas and particle phase are captured \u2026",

            "I. Introduction he most important factor for stable operation of scramjet engine is efficient mixing of entrained air and fuel which leads to robust flame holding. However, developing scramjet with experimental method requires tremendous expense and time, so Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is concerned as a best option to acquire key design parameters. Large Eddy Simulation (LES), one of the most promising CFD technique, have showed high accuracy in space and time, and capture combustion instabilities precisely, but the computational cost is very high since the size of cell must be small in the supersonic flows. Hybrid RANS\/LES method, on the other hand, requires less computational cost than LES and shows reasonable accuracy. There are two categories for hybrid RANS\/LES method. The first branch is zonal approach that RANS is applied to near-wall region and LES is used in other regions directly \u2026",
