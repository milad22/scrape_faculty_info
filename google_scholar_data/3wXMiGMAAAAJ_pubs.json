The optimized ZnO NWA\/GF electrode provided a high surface area and high selectivity with a detection limit of 1 nM for UA and DA. The high selectivity in the oxidation potential was explained by the gap difference between the lowest unoccupied and highest occupied molecular orbitals of a biomolecule for a set of given electrodes. This method was further used to detect UA levels in the serum of patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The UA level was 25% lower in PD patients than in healthy individuals. This finding strongly implies that UA can be used as a biomarker for PD.",

Here, we investigate transport properties of a prototype multilayer MoS2\/WSe2 heterojunction via a tunable charge inversion\/depletion layer. A charge inversion layer was constructed at the surface of WSe2 due to its relatively low doping concentration compared to that of MoS2, which can be tuned by the back-gate bias. The depletion region was limited within a few nanometers in the MoS2 side, while charges are fully depleted on the whole WSe2 side, which are determined by Raman spectroscopy and transport measurements. Charge transport through the heterojunction was influenced by the presence of the inversion layer and involves \u2026",

N-type semiconducting MoS2 under a large negative gate bias generates a photocurrent attributed to the increase of excess carriers in the conduction band by optical excitation. However, under a large positive gate bias, a phase shift from semiconducting to metallic MoS2 is caused, and the photocurrent by excess carriers in the conduction band induced by the laser disappears due to enhanced electron\u2013electron scattering. Thus, no photocurrent is detected in metallic MoS2. Our results indicate that the photocurrent of MoS2 can be switched on\/off by appropriately controlling the MIT transition by means of gate bias.",
