            "Three-dimensional gyrokinetic simulations of microturbulence in magnetically confined toroidal plasmas with massively parallel computers showed that, with linear flow damping, an asymptotic residual flow develops in agreement with analytic calculations. Nonlinear global simulations of instabilities driven by temperature gradients in the ion component of the plasma support the view that turbulence-driven fluctuating zonal flows can substantially reduce turbulent transport. Finally, the outstanding differences in the flow dynamics observed in global and local simulations are found to be due to profile variations.",

            "Results from 3D global gyrokinetic particle simulations of ion-temperature-gradient driven microturbulence in a toroidal plasma show that the ion thermal transport level in the interior region exhibits significant dependence on the ion-ion collision frequency even in regimes where the instabilities are collisionless. This is identified as arising from the Coulomb collisional damping of turbulence-generated zonal flows.",
