Expressions for energy dispersion relation and spin-dependent eigenstates for electrons and holes are found via simplification of a perturbative expansion in wave vector k away from the zone center using elementary group theory. Importantly, we expose the underlying symmetries giving rise to substantial anisotropy in optical absorption, charge, and spin transport properties, and reveal the mechanism responsible for valence band distortion and possible lack of a true direct gap.",

The ultrafast electron transfer from the center of the Brillouin zone to its edge allows us to achieve high spin polarizations and to resolve the spin dynamics of holes and electrons. The circular polarization degree of the direct gap photoluminescence exceeds the theoretical bulk limit, yielding\u223c 37% and\u223c 85% for transitions with heavy and light holes states, respectively. The spin lifetime of holes at the top of the valence band is estimated to be\u223c 0.5 ps and it is governed by transitions between light and heavy hole states. Electrons at the bottom of the conduction band, on the other hand, have a spin lifetime that exceeds 5 ns below 150 K.
