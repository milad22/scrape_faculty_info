In the limit of slow spatial variations, we obtain coupled diffusion equations for the electron density and spin. Using these equations we calculate electric-field induced spin accumulation and spin current in a finite-size sample for an arbitrary ratio between spin-orbit energy splitting \u0394 and elastic scattering rate \u03c4\u2212 1. We demonstrate that the spin-Hall conductivity vanishes in an infinite system independent of this ratio.",

We show that this universality does not survive electron-electron interaction, which results in nontrivial frequency dependence. We begin with analyzing the perturbation theory in the interaction parameter g for the electron self-energy and observe the failure of the random-phase approximation. The optical conductivity is then derived from the quantum kinetic equation, and the exact result is obtained in the limit when g\u226a 1\u226a g| ln\ufeff \u03c9|.",

The calculations are performed using three different methods: i) electron polarization function, ii) Kubo formula for the conductivity, iii) quantum transport equation. Surprisingly, these methods yield different results unless a proper ultraviolet cut-off procedure is implemented, which requires that the interaction potential in the effective Dirac Hamiltonian is cut-off at small distances (large momenta).",

Such processes, not accounted for in the conventional Luttinger liquid theory, cause drag only because the electron dispersion relation is not linear.

The latter is exact only in the limit of N\u2192\u221e, where N is the \u201ccolor\u201d degeneracy. We find that the ladder-type vertex corrections become crucial close to the threshold as the ratio of the n th order ladder term to the same order random phase approximation contribution is ln\ufeff n| q v\u2212 \u03c9|\/N n. We perform an analytical summation of the infinite series of ladder diagrams which describe the excitonic effect.
