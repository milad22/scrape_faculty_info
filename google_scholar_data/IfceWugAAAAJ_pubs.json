This is the energy of the strong gamma-ray line from decay of 56 Co, which was predicted 1, 3 to be seen from supernovae. The inferred average line flux during this period is (1.0\u00b10.25) x 10\u2212 3 photons cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 at an energy of 843\u00b15 keV. This feature cannot be explained by any statistical or systematic fluctuations observed in the seven previous years of GRS data. There is also evidence for the 1,238-keV line from 56 Co decay, with an average flux of\u223c(6\u00b12) xlO\u2212 4 photons cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 The quoted photon fluxes for both lines are preliminary.

            "The Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment OSSE on the COMPTON Gamma Ray Observatory has observed SN1987A for two 2-week periods during the first nine months of the mission. Evidence for gamma-ray line and continuum emission from 57Co is observed with an intensity of about 10exp-4 gamma-sq cm sexp-1. This photon flux between 50 and 136 keV is demonstrated by Monte Carlo calculations to be independent of the radial distribution of the 57Co for models of low optical depth viz., models having photoelectric absorption losses of 122 keV photons no greater than several percent. For such models the observed 57Co flux indicates that the ratio of 57Ni56Ni produced in the explosion was about 1.5 times the solar system ratio of 57Fe56Fe. When compared with nearly contemporaneous bolometric estimates of the luminosity for SN1987A, our observations imply that 57Co radioactivity does not account for most of the current luminosity of the supernova remnant in low-optical-depth models. We suggest alternatives including a large-optical-depth model that is able to provide the SN1987A luminosity and is consistent with the OSSE flux. It requires a 5756 production ratio of about twice solar.Descriptors:",

The instrument characteristics and data-reduction procedures are described, and the results are presented in extensive tables and graphs and discussed with reference to theoretical models. Gamma-ray fluxes significantly above possible instrumental levels (as determined from analysis of pre-1987 data) were detected in the second half of 1987 and the first half of 1988. The data are found to favor a model with some Co-56 in regions of low gamma-ray optical depth by 200 d after the SN outburst over models with all Co-56 at one depth within a uniform expanding envelope. Also investigated are the gamma-ray contribution to the total bolometric luminosity and the escape (and potential observability) of Co-57 gamma rays.",

            "The potential for observing annihilation gamma rays from novae is investigated. These gamma rays, a unique signature of the thermonuclear runaway models of novae, would result from the annihilation of positrons emitted by beta (+)-unstable nuclei produced near the peak of the runaway and carried by rapid convection to the surface of the nova envelope. Simple models, which are extensions of detailed published models, of the expansion of the nova atmospheres are evolved. These models serve as input into investigations of the fate of nearby Galactic fast novae could yield detectable fluxes of electron-positron annihilation gamma rays produced by the decay of N-13 and F-18. Although nuclear gamma-ray lines are produced by other nuclei, it is unlikely that the fluxes at typical nova distances would be detectable to present and near-future instruments.",

            "The low-energy gamma-ray spectrum from the direction of the Galactic center is determined using data obtained with the SMM Gamma-Ray Spectrometer. It is found that the diffuse gamma-ray spectrum from the Galactic center region can be interpreted in a straightforward way as the sum of five components of a presented equation. The components include a hard power law dominating the continuum at high energies caused principally by cosmic ray electron bremsstrahlung radiation, two narrow lines due to Al-26 decay and positron annihilation, an excess continuum component below 0.511 MeV consistent with the annihilation of positrons by formation of Ps, and a soft power law at low energies which is consistent with an extrapolation upward in energy of known hard X-ray sources in the Galactic center region.",

            "The Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite (SMM) has observed a strong Galactic source of 511 keV annihilation radiation from its launch in 1980 to its reentry in 1989. These observations are consistent with an extended source having an intensity of about 0.002 gamma\/sq cm\/s averaged over the central radian of Galactic longitude. These data are searched for evidence of the variable Galactic center source of 511 keV line radiation which was reported to have reappeared in 1988 by Leventhal et al. The SMM data are consistent with, but do not require, a compact source emitting a time-averaged flux of about 0.0004 gamma\/sq cm\/s during about 3 month transits in 1987 and 1988; they are inconsistent with a compact source flux in excess of 0.0008 gamma\/sq cm\/s for each year.",
