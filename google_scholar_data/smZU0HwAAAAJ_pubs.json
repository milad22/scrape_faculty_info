Our experiments show that, at the surface, a bulk soft-phonon mode freezes into a static lattice distortion associated with an in-plane rotation of the RuO6octahedron. First-principle calculations confirm this structure and predict a FM ground state at the surface. This coupling between structure and magnetism in the environment of broken symmetry at the surface allows a reconsideration of the coupling mechanism in the bulk.",

In spite of the large differences in the Curie temperatures (T C\u2019s) of different manganites, their low-temperature spin waves have very similar dispersions with the zone-boundary magnon softening and broadening that cannot be explained by the canonical double exchange mechanism. From the wave-vector dependence of the magnon lifetime effects and its correlation with the dispersions of the optical-phonon modes, we argue that a strong magnetoelastic (magnon-phonon) coupling is responsible for the observed low-temperature anomalous spin dynamical behavior of the manganites.",

CDWs have their origin rooted in the instability of a one-dimensional system described by Peierls. The extension of this concept to reduced dimensional systems has led to the concept of Fermi surface nesting (FSN), which dictates the wave vector  of the CDW and the corresponding lattice distortion. The idea is that segments of the Fermi contours are connected by , resulting in the effective screening of phonons inducing Kohn anomalies in their dispersion at , driving a lattice restructuring at low temperatures. There is growing theoretical and experimental evidence that this picture fails in many real systems and in fact it is the momentum dependence of the electron\u2013phonon coupling (EPC) matrix element that determines the characteristic of the CDW phase.

High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) further confirms the high crystalline feature of the m-ZrO2 nanostructures.

            "Mott transitions, which are metal-insulator transitions (MITs) driven by electron-electron interactions, are usually accompanied in bulk by structural phase transitions. In the layered perovskite Ca1.9Sr0.1RuO4, such a first-order Mott MIT occurs in the bulk at a temperature of 154 kelvin on cooling. In contrast, at the surface, an unusual inherent Mott MIT is observed at 130 kelvin, also on cooling but without a simultaneous lattice distortion. The broken translational symmetry at the surface causes a compressional stress that results in a 150% increase in the buckling of the Ca\/Sr-O surface plane as compared to the bulk. The Ca\/Sr ions are pulled toward the bulk, which stabilizes a phase more amenable to a Mott insulator ground state than does the bulk structure and also energetically prohibits the structural transition that accompanies the bulk MIT.",
