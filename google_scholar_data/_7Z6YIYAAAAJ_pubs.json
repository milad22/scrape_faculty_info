However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid\u2013solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) by atomic layer deposition. Li 7 La 2.75 Ca 0.25 Zr 1.75 Nb 0.25 O 12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity.

            "Macroscopic laws of friction do not generally apply to nanoscale contacts. Although continuum mechanics models have been predicted to break down at the nanoscale 1, they continue to be applied for lack of a better theory. An understanding of how friction force depends on applied load and contact area at these scales is essential for the design of miniaturized devices with optimal mechanical performance 2, 3. Here we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with realistic force fields to establish friction laws in dry nanoscale contacts. We show that friction force depends linearly on the number of atoms that chemically interact across the contact. By defining the contact area as being proportional to this number of interacting atoms, we show that the macroscopically observed linear relationship between friction force and contact area can be extended to the nanoscale. Our model predicts that as the adhesion \u2026",

            "Lithium solid electrolytes can potentially address two key limitations of the organic electrolytes used in today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries, namely, their flammability and limited electrochemical stability. However, achieving a Li+ conductivity in the solid state comparable to existing liquid electrolytes (> 1 mS cm\u2212 1) is particularly challenging. In this work, we reveal a fundamental relationship between anion packing and ionic transport in fast Li-conducting materials and expose the desirable structural attributes of good Li-ion conductors. We find that an underlying body-centred cubic-like anion framework, which allows direct Li hops between adjacent tetrahedral sites, is most desirable for achieving high ionic conductivity, and that indeed this anion arrangement is present in several known fast Li-conducting materials and other fast ion conductors. These findings provide important insight towards the understanding of ionic \u2026",

The common solid electrolytes were found to have a limited electrochemical window. Our results suggest that the outstanding stability of the solid electrolyte materials is not thermodynamically intrinsic but is originated from kinetic stabilizations. The sluggish kinetics of the decomposition reactions cause a high overpotential leading to a nominally wide electrochemical window observed in many experiments. The decomposition products, similar to the solid-electrolyte-interphases, mitigate the extreme chemical potential from the electrodes and protect the solid electrolyte from further decompositions.

Among all solid electrolyte materials ranging from sulfides to oxides and oxynitrides, cubic garnet\u2013type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) ceramic electrolytes are superior candidates because of their high ionic conductivity (10\u22123 to 10\u22124 S\/cm) and good stability against Li metal. However, garnet solid electrolytes generally have poor contact with Li metal, which causes high resistance and uneven current distribution at the interface. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a strategy to engineer the garnet solid electrolyte and the Li metal interface by forming an intermediary Li-metal alloy, which changes the wettability of the garnet surface (lithiophobic to lithiophilic) and reduces the interface resistance by more than an order of magnitude: 950 ohm\u00b7cm2 for the pristine garnet\/Li and 75 ohm\u00b7cm2 \u2026",
