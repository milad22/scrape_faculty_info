            "We have observed reversible light-induced mechanical switching for individual organic molecules bound to a metal surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to image the features of individual azobenzene molecules on Au (111) before and after reversibly cycling their mechanical structure between trans and cis states using light. Azobenzene molecules were engineered to increase their surface photomechanical activity by attaching varying numbers of tert-butyl (TB) ligands (\u201clegs\u201d) to the azobenzene phenyl rings. STM images show that increasing the number of TB legs \u201clifts\u201d the azobenzene molecules from the substrate, thereby increasing molecular photomechanical activity by decreasing molecule-surface coupling.",

Simultaneous with the single-fluorophore detection, we clearly observed coincident angstrom-scale changes in tether extension.

The new instrument will enable the simultaneous measurement of angstrom-scale mechanical motion of individual DNA-binding proteins (for example, single-base-pair stepping of DNA translocases) along with the detection of properties of fluorescently labeled protein (for example, internal configuration).",

Unfortunately, most techniques do not provide a direct measurement of this relationship. Structural data are typically limited to static pictures, and function must be inferred. Conversely, functional assays usually provide little information on structural conformation. We developed a single-molecule technique combining optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy that allows for both measurements simultaneously. Here we present measurements of UvrD, a DNA repair helicase, that directly and unambiguously reveal the connection between its structure and function. Our data reveal that UvrD exhibits two distinct types of unwinding activity regulated by its stoichiometry. Furthermore, two UvrD conformational states, termed \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201copen,\u201d correlate with movement toward or away from the DNA fork.",

We have observed the self-assembly behavior of azobenzene molecules adsorbed to Au (111) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that azobenzene creates a surprising variety of surface structures whose commensurability with the underlying Au (111)\u201cherringbone\u201d reconstruction is coverage dependent. Two commensurate molecular chain phases exist in the low-coverage regime, and phase conversion between these structures can be induced using the STM tip. In the high-coverage regime we observe incommensurate molecular phases as well as commensurate molecular vacancy ordering. These molecular structures reflect a coverage-dependent competition between molecule-molecule and molecule-substrate interactions.",
