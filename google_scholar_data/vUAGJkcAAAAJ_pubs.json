            "We present a calculation of the Nucleon and Delta excited state spectra on dynamical anisotropic clover lattices. A method for operator construction is introduced that allows for the reliable identification of the continuum spins of baryon states, overcoming the reduced symmetry of the cubic lattice. Using this method, we are able to determine a spectrum of single-particle states for spins up to and including J= 7 2, of both parities, the first time this has been achieved in a lattice calculation. We find a spectrum of states identifiable as admixtures of S U (6)\u2297 O (3) representations and a counting of levels that is consistent with the nonrelativistic q q q constituent quark model. This dense spectrum is incompatible with quark-diquark model solutions to the \u201cmissing resonance problem\u201d and shows no signs of parity doubling of states.",

The technique applies a low-rank operator to define smooth fields that are to be used in hadron creation operators. The resulting space of smooth fields is small enough that all elements of the reduced quark propagator can be computed exactly at reasonable computational cost. Correlations between arbitrary sources, including multihadron operators can be computed a posteriori without requiring new lattice Dirac operator inversions. The method is tested on realistic lattice sizes with light dynamical quarks.",

With careful operator construction, the combination of these techniques is used to identify the continuum spin of extracted states reliably, overcoming the reduced rotational symmetry of the cubic lattice. Excited states, states with exotic quantum numbers (0+\u2212, 1\u2212+ and 2+\u2212), and states of high spin are resolved, including, for the first time in a lattice QCD calculation, spin-four states. The determinations of the spectrum of isovector mesons and kaons are performed on dynamical lattices with two volumes and with pion masses down to\u223c 400 MeV, with statistical precision typically at or below 1% even for highly excited states.",
