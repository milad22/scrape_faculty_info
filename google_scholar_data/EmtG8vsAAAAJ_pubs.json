            "With about two-thirds of all used energy being lost as waste heat, there is a compelling need for high-performance thermoelectric materials that can directly and reversibly convert heat to electrical energy. However, the practical realization of thermoelectric materials is limited by their hitherto low figure of merit, ZT, which governs the Carnot efficiency according to the second law of thermodynamics. The recent successful strategy of nanostructuring to reduce thermal conductivity has achieved record-high ZT values in the range 1.5\u20131.8 at 750\u2013900 kelvin 1, 2, 3, but still falls short of the generally desired threshold value of 2. Nanostructures in bulk thermoelectrics allow effective phonon scattering of a significant portion of the phonon spectrum, but phonons with long mean free paths remain largely unaffected. Here we show that heat-carrying phonons with long mean free paths can be scattered by controlling and fine \u2026",

Since the scattering mean free path is less than the emission wavelength, recurrent light scattering arises and provides coherent feedback for lasing. Discrete lasing modes have been observed above the threshold. The dependence of the lasing threshold intensity on the excitation volume agrees with the random laser theory. Laser emission from the powder could be observed in all directions. This observation also provides direct evidence for the existence of recurrent scattering of light.",

Two types of generic perovskites compounds have been used in cell fabrication: either Pb- or Sn-based. Here, we describe the performance of perovskite solar cells based on alloyed perovskite solid solutions of methylammonium tin iodide and its lead analogue (CH3NH3Sn1\u2013xPbxI3). We exploit the fact that, the energy band gaps of the mixed Pb\/Sn compounds do not follow a linear trend (the Vegard\u2019s law) in between these two extremes of 1.55 and 1.35 eV, respectively, but have narrower bandgap (<1.3 eV), thus extending the light absorption into the near-infrared (\u223c1,050 nm).

            "Uniformly distributed ZnO nanorods have been grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using a two-step process. By controlling the oxygen content in the gas mixture during the nucleation and growth steps, no catalyst is required for the formation of ZnO nanorods. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies show that ZnO nanorods are single crystals and that they grow along the c axis of the crystal plane. Alignment of these nanorods with respect to the substrates depends on the lattice mismatch between ZnO and the substrate, the surface electric field, and the amount of defects in the starting nuclei. Room-temperature photoluminescence measurements of these ZnO nanorods have shown ultraviolet peaks at 380 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 106 meV, which are comparable to those found in high-quality ZnO films.
