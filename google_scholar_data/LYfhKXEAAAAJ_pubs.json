            "Fullerene single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) were produced in yields of more than 70 percent by condensation of a laser-vaporized carbon-nickel-cobalt mixture at 1200\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy showed that these SWNTs are nearly uniform in diameter and that they self-organize into \u201cropes,\u201d which consist of 100 to 500 SWNTs in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 17 angstroms. The x-ray form factor is consistent with that of uniformly charged cylinders 13.8 \u00b1 0.2 angstroms in diameter. The ropes were metallic, with a single-rope resistivity of <10\u22124 ohm-centimeters at 300 kelvin. The uniformity of SWNT diameter is attributed to the efficient annealing of an initial fullerene tubelet kept open by a few metal atoms; the optimum diameter is determined by competition between the strain energy of curvature of the graphene sheet and the dangling-bond energy of the open edge \u2026",

            "We introduce the 2D counterpart of layered black phosphorus, which we call phosphorene, as an unexplored p-type semiconducting material. Same as graphene and MoS2, single-layer phosphorene is flexible and can be mechanically exfoliated. We find phosphorene to be stable and, unlike graphene, to have an inherent, direct, and appreciable band gap. Our ab initio calculations indicate that the band gap is direct, depends on the number of layers and the in-layer strain, and is significantly larger than the bulk value of 0.31\u20130.36 eV. The observed photoluminescence peak of single-layer phosphorene in the visible optical range confirms that the band gap is larger than that of the bulk system. Our transport studies indicate a hole mobility that reflects the structural anisotropy of phosphorene and complements n-type MoS2. At room temperature, our few-layer phosphorene field-effect transistors with 1.0 \u03bcm channel \u2026",

            "Studying the reason why single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) appears to fall short of its promising potential in flexible nanoelectronics, we find that the nature of contacts plays a more important role than the semiconductor itself. In order to understand the nature of MoS 2\/metal contacts, we perform ab initio density functional theory calculations for the geometry, bonding, and electronic structure of the contact region. We find that the most common contact metal (Au) is rather inefficient for electron injection into single-layer MoS 2 and propose Ti as a representative example of suitable alternative electrode materials.",

            "We have measured the Raman spectrum of individual single walled carbon nanotubes in solution and compare it to that obtained from the same starting material where the tubes are present in ordered bundles or ropes. Interestingly, the radial mode frequencies for the tubes in solution are found to be\u223c 10 cm\u2212 1 higher than those observed for tubes in a rope, in apparent contradiction to lattice dynamics predictions. We suggest that there is no such contradiction, and propose that the upshift is due rather to a decreased energy spacing of the Van Hove singularities in isolated tubes over the spacings in a rope, thereby allowing the same laser excitation to excite different diameter tubes in these two samples.",
