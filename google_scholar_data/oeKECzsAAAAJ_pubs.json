            "A large variety of animals has the ability to sense the geomagnetic field and utilize it as a source of directional (compass) information. It is not known by which biophysical mechanism this magnetoreception is achieved. We investigate the possibility that magnetoreception involves radical-pair processes that are governed by anisotropic hyperfine coupling between (unpaired) electron and nuclear spins. We will show theoretically that fields of geomagnetic field strength and weaker can produce significantly different reaction yields for different alignments of the radical pairs with the magnetic field. As a model for a magnetic sensory organ we propose a system of radical pairs being 1) orientationally ordered in a molecular substrate and 2) exhibiting changes in the reaction yields that affect the visual transduction pathway. We evaluate three-dimensional visual modulation patterns that can arise from the influence of the \u2026",

Subsequently identified in prokaryotes, archaea, and many eukaryotes, cryptochromes function in the animal circadian clock and are proposed as magnetoreceptors in migratory birds. Cryptochromes are closely structurally related to photolyases, evolutionarily ancient flavoproteins that catalyze light-dependent DNA repair.

            "Migratory birds are known to use the geomagnetic field as a source of compass information 1, 2. There are two competing hypotheses for the primary process underlying the avian magnetic compass, one involving magnetite 3, 4, 5, the other a magnetically sensitive chemical reaction 6, 7, 8. Here we show that oscillating magnetic fields disrupt the magnetic orientation behaviour of migratory birds. Robins were disoriented when exposed to a vertically aligned broadband (0.1\u201310 MHz) or a single-frequency (7-MHz) field in addition to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, in the 7-MHz oscillating field, this effect depended on the angle between the oscillating and the geomagnetic fields. The birds exhibited seasonally appropriate migratory orientation when the oscillating field was parallel to the geomagnetic field, but were disoriented when it was presented at a 24 or 48 angle. These results are consistent with a resonance \u2026",

            "Life as we know it today exists largely because of photosynthesis, the process through which light energy is converted into chemical energy by plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria (Priestley, 1772; Barnes, 1893; Wurmser, 1925; Van Niel, 1941; Clayton & Sistrom, 1978; Blankenship et al. 1995; Ort & Yocum, 1996). Historically, photosynthetic organisms are grouped into two classes. When photosynthesis is carried out in the presence of air it is called oxygenic photosynthesis (Ort & Yocum, 1996). Otherwise, it is anoxygenic (Blankenship et al. 1995). Higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria perform oxygenic photosynthesis, which involves reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate and oxidation of water to produce molecular oxygen. Some photosynthetic bacteria, such as purple bacteria, carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis that involves oxidation of molecules other than water. In spite of these differences, the general principles of energy transduction are the same in anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis (Van Niel, 1931, 1941; Stanier, 1961; Wraight, 1982; Gest, 1993). The primary processes of photosynthesis involve absorption of photons by light-harvesting complexes (LHs), transfer of excitation energy from LHs to the photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs), and the primary charge separation across the photosynthetic membrane (Sauer, 1975; Knox, 1977; Fleming & van Grondelle, 1994; van Grondelle et al. 1994).
