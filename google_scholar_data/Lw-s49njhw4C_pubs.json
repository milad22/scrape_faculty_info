Therefore, we investigated the role of sphingosine kinase type 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that makes S1P, in the motility, growth, and chemoresistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important growth factor for breast cancer progression, activated and translocated SphK1 to plasma membrane. SphK1 was required for EGF-directed motility. Downregulation of SphK1 in MCF-7 cells reduced EGF- and serum-stimulated growth and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin, a potent chemotherapeutic agent. These results suggest that SphK1 may be critical for growth, metastasis and chemoresistance of human breast cancers.",

Here, we report that two microRNAs, miR-322\/424 and miR-503, are induced and promote cdk2 inhibition during myogenesis. These microRNAs down-regulate Cdc25A, the phosphatase responsible for removing inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk2, both in myoblasts differentiating into myotubes and in nonmuscle cells. Cdc25A is down-regulated during muscle differentiation by multiple pathways: action of these two microRNAs, proteasomal degradation of Cdc25A protein and transcriptional repression. Overexpression of Cdc25A or of cdk2 with mutations on T14 and Y15 (cdk2-AF), so that it cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation, decreases differentiation and differentiation-induced cell cycle quiescence.

Chemotaxis of HEK 293 cells toward EGF was inhibited by N,N-dimethylsphingosine, a competitive inhibitor of both SphKs, implicating S1P generation in this process.

X-ray crystallographic, MS, NMR spectroscopic, and kinetic studies of the mechanisms of inhibition indicate that different intermediates or transition states are being represented that are dependent on the conditions of measurement and the specific groups flanking the carbonyl in the inhibitor. The species observed crystallographically are most consistent with tetrahedral intermediates that may be close approximations of those that occur during substrate hydrolysis.

Deletion of the S1P2 receptor dramatically increased migration of mouse embryonic fibroblasts toward S1P, serum, and PDGF but not fibronectin. This enhanced migration was dependent on expression of S1P1 and sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that produces S1P, as revealed by downregulation of their expression with antisense RNA and small interfering RNA, respectively. Although S1P2 deletion had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptors or activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1\/2 or Akt induced by PDGF, it reduced sustained PDGF-dependent p38 \u2026",

            "Recently, a variety of schemes for obtaining 2D heteronuclear RELAY spectra have been proposed (I-6). These methods can be quite powerful for structure determination and spectral assignment. However, a recent analysis (7) has shown that in many cases the sensitivity of heteronuclear relayed-magnetization-transfer spectroscopy is considerably lower than for heteronuclear chemical-shift correlation (8-10). Especially in compounds with saturated aliphatic ring systems, such as steroids and alkaloids, the sensitivity of the heteronuclear RELAY experiment is often very low. Moreover, in all heteronuclear RELAY experiments proposed so far the \u2018H-\u2018H multiplet components of the (\u2018H-13C) RELAY multiplet are in antiphase relative to one another (analogous to the antiphase nature of multiplet components in a COSY spectrum (II)) and the \u2018H-13C RELAY multiplet is 90\u201d out of phase relative to nonrelayed signal in the 2D spectrum. No pure-absorption 2D spectra can therefore be recorded with the existing RELAY experiments. We propose a new pulse scheme for heteronuclear RELAY spectroscopy that partly overcomes the problems mentioned above. In the new scheme, net magnetization transfer among protons is achieved via homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn-type cross-polarization. This type of homonuclear magnetization transfer was first discovered (12) as an artifact in homonuclear transverse NOE spectroscopy (13) and is closely related to the magnetization-transfer mechanism in the TOCSY experiment (14). We have recently demonstrated that this type of homonuclear cross-polarization is very powerful for the assignment of complex proton \u2026",

Efficacy was determined by measurement of paw inflammation, assessment of bone mineral density using dual\u2010energy x\u2010ray absorptiometry (DEXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histologic evaluation.SB 273005 is a potent antagonist of the closely related integrins, \u03b1v\u03b23 (Ki = 1.2 nM) and \u03b1v\u03b25 (Ki = 0.3 nM). When SB 273005 was administered prophylactically to AIA rats twice per day, it inhibited paw edema at doses of 10, 30, and 60 mg\/kg, by 40%, 50%, and 52%, respectively. Therapeutic administration twice daily was also effective, and a reduction in paw \u2026",
