            "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and liver-related death worldwide, with the majority of these cases occurring in areas of Africa and Asia where HBV prevalence is high. Many of the countries that are affected by hepatitis B are also affected by a high HIV burden, leading to frequent HIV\/HBV co-infection. The consequences of co-infection, including increased liver-related morbidity and mortality, increased hepatitis B viral replication, immune reconstitution to HBV in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, and hepatotoxicity from antiretroviral drugs, are especially important in regions with expanding antiretroviral programmes. Little data, however, are available on HIV\/HBV co-infection from regions with high chronic hepatitis B prevalence. This Review discusses the epidemiology, natural history, pathogenesis, and management of HIV\/HBV co-infection from these areas. Topics for future \u2026",

Severe hepatotoxicity cases were identified during the first 12 months of ART.

Despite considerable study, the host determinants of sites for integration have not been fully clarified. To investigate integration site selection in vivo, we used two approaches. (i) We have analyzed the host sequences flanking 61 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration sites made by experimental infection and compared them to a library of 104 control sequences. (ii) We have also analyzed HIV-1 integration frequencies near several human repeated-sequence DNA families, using a repeat-specific PCR-based assay. At odds with previous reports from smaller-scale studies, we found no strong biases either for or against integration near repetitive sequences such as Alu or LINE-1 elements. We also did not find a clear bias for integration in transcription units as proposed previously \u2026",

            "  Background. Episodes of viremia are common in African antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. We sought to describe viremia, resuppression, and accumulation of resistance during first-line combination ART (cART) in South Africa.  Methods. Retrospective analysis of a cohort receiving zidovudine, lamivudine, and either efavirenz or nevirapine with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA monitoring every 6 months. We assessed viremia (HIV RNA >1000 copies\/mL after initial HIV RNA response) and resuppression (HIV RNA <400 copies\/mL after viremia). Genotypic resistance testing was performed using stored plasma on a subset of patients at first detection of viremia and subsequently among patients with persistent viremia.  Results. Between 2002 and 2006, 3727 patients initiated cART (median CD4, 147 cells\/mm3). Of 1007 patients who \u2026",
