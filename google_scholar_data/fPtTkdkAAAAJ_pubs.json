            "Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics introduces students, scientists, and engineers to the full range of activity in the rapidly growing field on nonlinear dynamics. Using a step-by-step introduction to dynamics and geometry in state space as the central focus of understanding nonlinear dynamics, thisbook includes a thorough treatment of both differential equation models and iterated map models (including a derivation of the famous Feigenbaum numbers). It is the only book at this level to include the increasingly important field of pattern formation and a survey of the controversial questions ofquantum chaos. Important tools such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions are treated in detail. With over 200 figures and diagrams, and analytic and computer exercises for every chapter, the book can be used as a course-text or for self-instruction. This second edition has been restructuredto make the book even more useful as a course text: many of the more complex examples and derivations have been moved to appendices. The extensive collection of annotated references has been updated through January 2000 and now includes listings of World Wide Web sites at many of the major nonlineardynamics research centers. From reviews on the 1\/e:'What has been lacking is a single book that takes the reader with nothing but a knowledge of elementary calculus and physics all the way to the frontiers of research in chaos and nonlinear dynamics in all its facets.[...] a serious student, teacher, or researcher would be delighted to have this book on the shelf as a reference and as a window to the literature in this exciting and rapidly growing new field of \u2026",

This progress has been possible thanks to materials development of Si quantum devices, and the physical understanding of quantum effects in silicon. Recent critical steps include the isolation of single electrons, the observation of spin blockade, and single-shot readout of individual electron spins in both dopants and gated quantum dots in Si. Each of these results has come with physics that was not anticipated from previous work in other material systems. These advances underline the significant progress toward the realization of spin quantum bits in a material with a long spin coherence time, crucial for quantum computation and spintronics.",

            "Nanofabricated quantum bits permit large-scale integration but usually suffer from short coherence times due to interactions with their solid-state environment 1. The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that it minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si\/SiGe quantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by resonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from a local micromagnet 2, and the spin state is read out in the single-shot mode 3. Electron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we attribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in silicon, a Ramsey decay timescale of 1 \u03bcs is observed, almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic timescales in GaAs quantum dots 4, 5, whereas gate operation \u2026",

            "This paper reviews a class of generic dissipative dynamical systems called N-K models. In these models, the dynamics of N elements, defined as Boolean variables, develop step by step, clocked by a discrete time variable. Each of the N Boolean elements at a given time is given a value which depends upon K elements in the previous time step. We review the work of many authors on the behavior of the models, looking particularly at the structure and lengths of their cycles, the sizes of their basins of attraction, and the flow of information through the systems. In the limit of infinite N, there is a phase transition between a chaotic and an ordered phase, with a critical phase in between. We argue that the behavior of this system depends significantly on the topology of the network connections. If the elements are placed upon a lattice with dimension d,the system shows correlations related to the standard percolation \u2026",
