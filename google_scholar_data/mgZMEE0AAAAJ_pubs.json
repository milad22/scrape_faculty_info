            "The goal of an activity-directed isolation process is to isolate bioactive compounds which may provide structural leads of therapeutic importance. Whereas the traditional process of drug development is long and expensive, simple and rapid bioassays can serve as the starting point for drug discovery. This book presents a range of\" bench top\" bioassa",

            "The need for the production of a comprehensive guide for identification of the fish fauna of the country was greatly felt since I started my career as a Biologist in the Freshwater Fisheries Research Station (presently Riverine Fisheries Research Institute) at Chandpur in 1964. At that time and upto the present day, published materials on the subject were scanty and the fishery biologists and students of Ichthyology had been facing immense difficulty in studying the fish fauna of the country.While I was studying in the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor during 1968-69, I had the opportunity to come in close contact with Professor Reeve M. Bailey, Curator of the Fish Division Museum of Zoology who was an authority in fish taxonomy in the United States. Professor Bailey pointed out that fish fauna of the South East Asian Region were poorly explored and that there was a great need for study of the ichthyofauna of the region including Bangladesh. He suggested me to undertake such a study with a view to fill the gap in the knowledge of the piscine fauna of the country. Besides, ichthyologists, fishery biologists, students and teaching staff of Colleges and Universities of the country from time to time had been urging me to bring out an upto date and comprehensive systematic account of the freshwater fishes of the country. Positive encouragement from my colleagues in the Department also inspired me to undertake this work.",
