            "We have investigated spin pumping from Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 thin films into Cu, Ag, Ta, W, Pt, and Au with varying spin-orbit coupling strengths. From measurements of Gilbert damping enhancement and inverse spin Hall signals spanning 3 orders of magnitude, we determine the spin Hall angles and interfacial spin mixing conductances for the six metals. The spin Hall angles largely vary as Z 4 (Z: atomic number), corroborating the role of spin-orbit coupling. Amongst the four 5d metals, the variation of the spin Hall angle is dominated by the sensitivity of the d-orbital moment to the d-electron count, confirming theoretical predictions.",

            "It is generally believed that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) follows Z 4 (atomic number) dependence and becomes significant only in heavy elements. Consequently, SOC in 3 d transition metals should be negligible given their small Z. Using dynamic spin pumping of Y 3 Fe 5 O 12-based structures, we uncover a systematic evolution of the spin Hall angle (\u03b8 SH) with d-orbital filling in a series of 3 d metals, reminiscent of behavior observed in 5 d metals. In particular, Cr and Ni show very large \u03b8 SH (half of that for Pt), indicating that d-orbital filling rather than Z plays a dominant role in the spin Hall effect (SHE) in 3 d metals. This result enriches our understanding of SHE and broadens the scope of materials available for exploring the rich phenomena enabled by SOC as well as presenting a guidepost for testing theoretical models of spin-orbit coupling in transition metals.",

Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system\u2019s ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection.
