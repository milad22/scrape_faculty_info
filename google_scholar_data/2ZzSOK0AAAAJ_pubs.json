            "It has long been recognized that as societies modernize, they experience significant changes in their patterns of health and disease. Despite rapid modernization across the globe, there are relatively few detailed case studies of changes in health and disease within specific countries especially for sub-Saharan African countries. This paper presents evidence to illustrate the nature and speed of the epidemiological transition in Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital city. As the most urbanized and modernized Ghanaian city, and as the national center of multidisciplinary research since becoming state capital in 1877, Accra constitutes an important case study for understanding the epidemiological transition in African cities. We review multidisciplinary research on culture, development, health, and disease in Accra since the late nineteenth century, as well as relevant work on Ghana\u2019s socio-economic and demographic \u2026",

            "In recent years the activities of street vendors have become a topical issue within the urban spaces of the developing world. Still, research that explores the geographical dimensions of street vending activities in Ghana is limited. Based on field interviews with street vendors, consumers, shop owners, and metropolitan authorities, a number of findings emerged. First, there were no noticeable socio-economic differences amongst street vendors operating within the study areas. However, noticeable differences in the areas of origin of vendors were observed, with most of them originating from the Eastern, Ashanti and Central Regions of the country. The study also shows a progression amongst trades over time, in terms of the types of goods which the vendors trade in. As may be expected, a shift to higher value items takes place as traders build up capital. Another important finding is that most of the vendors were \u2026",

            "Slums are universally assumed to be the worst places for people to live in, and it is often taken for granted that the livelihood situations of slum communities are also uniform and homogenous. So pervasive is the latter idea that most studies examining the livelihood situations of slum communities do not compare the socio-economic and cultural differences within such communities. A distinctive feature of slum communities is the pursuance of multiple livelihood strategies that are tied to migration. However, the links between migration and livelihood situations in many slum communities have not been extensively examined. The article seeks to examine the many faces of Nima, a slum community in Accra (Ghana), and link these to livelihoods and migration. The data for the study are drawn from varied sources, including in-depth, key informant interviews, personal observations, and census reports. The complexity and \u2026",

            "Studies of urban ethnicity have portrayed ethnic groups as initially concentrating in locations where they live in relatively exclusive residential areas containing few members of other groups. This concentration into ethnic enclaves is commonly regarded as a result of disadvantage and discrimination in the labour and housing markets, coupled with a desire for residential concentration to promote and guarantee group cultural, socioeconomic and physical security. To what extent do the neighbourhoods of Accra Metropolitan Area reflect these urban ethnicity patterns, and what are the factors shaping the concentration of ethnic groups in the city? Using the Location Quotient Index based on census data, the paper examines the degree of ethnic diversity and concentration in the neighbourhoods of Accra.

Over 22 months, integrated and continuous rooftop particulate matter (PM) monitors were placed at a total of 11 residential or roadside monitoring sites in four neighborhoods of varying SES and biomass fuel use. PM concentrations were highest in late December and January, due to dust blown from the Sahara. Excluding this period, annual PM2.5 ranged from 39 to 53 \u03bcg\/m3 at roadside sites and 30 to 70 \u03bcg\/m3 at residential sites; mean annual PM10 ranged from 80 to 108 \u03bcg\/m3 at roadside sites and 57 to 106 \u03bcg\/m3 at residential sites.
