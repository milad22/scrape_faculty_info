            "Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon the local spin density (LSD) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential.",

            "Ref.[1] was to present a simple, nonempirical derivation of a simplified generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy of density functional theory. Among the many conditions that might have been imposed to construct the functional, we selected as most appropriate to the GGA form those already satisfied by the local spin density (LSD) approximation, or by the numerical GGA derived from sum rules on the exchangecorrelation hole [2].One of the conditions already satisfied by LSD is the Lieb-Oxford bound [3]. By satisfying this bound locally (and only by so doing), we ensure that our GGA will satisfy the integrated bound for any possible electron density, as LSD does. The resulting GGA Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) is remarkably like the more complicated Perdew-Wang 1991 GGA derived from the sum rules. Simple physical arguments [4] explain its characteristic dependencies \u2026",

            "Within the adiabatic approximation, time-dependent density functional theory yields only single excitations. Near states of double excitation character, the exact exchange\u2013correlation kernel has a strong dependence on frequency. We derive the exact frequency-dependent kernel when a double excitation mixes with a single excitation, well separated from the other excitations, in the limit that the electron\u2013electron interaction is weak. Building on this, we construct a nonempirical approximation for the general case, and illustrate our results on a simple model.",
