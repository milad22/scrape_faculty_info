The performance of various modified jet algorithms, or jet grooming techniques, for several jet types and event topologies is investigated for jets with transverse momentum larger than 300 GeV. Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects. Studies of the expected discrimination power of jet mass and jet substructure observables in searches for new physics are also presented. Event samples enriched in boosted W and Z bosons and top-quark pairs are used to study both the individual jet invariant mass scales and the efficacy of algorithms to tag boosted hadronic objects.

            "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton\u2013proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s\u221a=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson, for  20\u2264pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |\u03b7|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |\u03b7|<1.2 ) for jets with  55\u2264pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |\u03b7|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating \u2026",

The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb\u2212 1 and 20.3 fb\u2212 1 at centre-of-mass energies of TeV and TeV respectively. All combinations of leptonic ( with \u2113= e, \u03bc) and hadronic (\u03c4\u2192 hadrons \u03bd) tau decays are considered. An excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.5 (3.4) standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the direct coupling of the recently discovered Higgs boson to fermions. The measured signal strength, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, of \u03bc= 1. 43\u2212 0.37+ 0.43 is consistent with the predicted Yukawa coupling strength in the Standard Model.",

The performance of various modified jet algorithms, or jet grooming techniques, for several jet types and event topologies is investigated for jets with transverse momentum larger than 300 GeV. Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects. Studies of the expected discrimination power of jet mass and jet substructure observables in searches for new physics are also presented. Event samples enriched in boosted W and Z bosons and top-quark pairs are used to study both the individual jet invariant mass scales and the efficacy of algorithms to tag boosted hadronic objects. The analyses presented use the full \u2026",

            "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton\u2013proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s\u221a=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson, for  20\u2264pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |\u03b7|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |\u03b7|<1.2 ) for jets with  55\u2264pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |\u03b7|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating \u2026",

Photon candidates are identified by combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate.
