            "Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has a quadratic time and space complexity that limits its use to small time series. In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarser resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of FastDTW by comparing it to two other types of existing approximate DTW algorithms: constraints (such as Sakoe-Chiba Bands) and abstraction. Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over existing methods.",

            "Credit card transactions continue to grow in number, taking an ever-larger share of the US payment system and leading to a higher rate of stolen account numbers and subsequent losses by banks. Improved fraud detection thus has become essential to maintain the viability of the US payment system. Banks have used early fraud warning systems for some years. Large scale data-mining techniques can improve the state of the art in commercial practice. Scalable techniques to analyze massive amounts of transaction data that efficiently compute fraud detectors in a timely manner is an important problem, especially for e-commerce. Besides scalability and efficiency, the fraud-detection task exhibits technical problems that include skewed distributions of training data and nonuniform cost per error, both of which have not been widely studied in the knowledge-discovery and data mining community.

It uses the cost of misclassifications to update the training distribution on successive boosting rounds. The purpose is to reduce the cumulative misclassification cost more than AdaBoost. We formally show that AdaCost reduces the upper bound of cumulative misclassification cost of the training set. Empirical evaluations have shown significant reduction in the cumulative misclassification cost over AdaBoost without consuming additional computing power.",
