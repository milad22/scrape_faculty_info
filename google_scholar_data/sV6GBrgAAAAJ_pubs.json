            "Improvements in experimental, analytical and computational methodologies together with published studies yielding seemingly contradictory results prompted us to return to the determination of zircon stability in the range of felsic to intermediate melts expected in continental environments. We (re-) analyzed both the run products from the zircon crystallization study of Watson and Harrison (1983) and a new style of zircon dissolution experiments (up to 25 kbar) using a large radius ion microprobe to constrain a refined zircon solubility model. The new data yield broadly similar patterns as before when arrayed for temperature and confirm that the parameter M [=(Na+ K+ 2Ca)\/(Al\u00b7 Si)] is an appropriate compositional proxy for the chemical interactions through which zircon is dissolved. We used a Bayesian approach to optimize the calculation of the coefficients in the zircon solution model, which is given by: ln D Zr \u2026",
