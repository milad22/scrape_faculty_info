            "Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures of WS 2\/MoS 2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS 2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS 2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS 2 on MoS 2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that \u2026",

            "The isolation of graphene in 2004 from graphite was a defining moment for the \u201cbirth\u201d of a field: two-dimensional (2D) materials. In recent years, there has been a rapidly increasing number of papers focusing on non-graphene layered materials, including transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), because of the new properties and applications that emerge upon 2D confinement. Here, we review significant recent advances and important new developments in 2D materials \u201cbeyond graphene\u201d. We provide insight into the theoretical modeling and understanding of the van der Waals (vdW) forces that hold together the 2D layers in bulk solids, as well as their excitonic properties and growth morphologies. Additionally, we highlight recent breakthroughs in TMD synthesis and characterization and discuss the newest families of 2D materials, including monoelement 2D materials (i.e., silicene, phosphorene, etc.) and \u2026",

The Raman response as well as the luminescence as a function of the number of S\u2013W\u2013S layers is also reported. The PL weakens with increasing number of layers due to a transition from direct band gap in a monolayer to indirect gap in multilayers.

            "The Raman scattering of single-and few-layered WS 2 is studied as a function of the number of SWS layers and the excitation wavelength in the visible range (488, 514 and 647 nm). For the three excitation wavelengths used in this study, the frequency of the A 1g (\u0393) phonon mode monotonically decreases with the number of layers. For single-layer WS 2, the 514.5 nm laser excitation generates a second-order Raman resonance involving the longitudinal acoustic mode (LA (M)). This resonance results from a coupling between the electronic band structure and lattice vibrations. First-principles calculations were used to determine the electronic and phonon band structures of single-layer and bulk WS 2. The reduced intensity of the 2LA mode was then computed, as a function of the laser wavelength, from the fourth-order Fermi golden rule.

            "Gold nanoparticles were selectively attached to chemically functionalized surface sites on nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) nanotubes. A cationic polyelectrolyte was adsorbed on the surface of the nanotubes by electrostatic interaction between carboxyl groups on the chemically oxidized nanotube surface and polyelectrolyte chains. Negatively charged 10 nm gold nanoparticles from a gold colloid suspension were subsequently anchored to the surface of the nanotubes through the electrostatic interaction between the polyelectrolyte and the nanoparticles. This approach provides an efficient method to attach other nanostructures to carbon nanotubes and can be used as an illustrative detection of the functional groups on carbon nanotube surfaces. ",
