            "One of the fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics is associated with the Hermiticity of physical observables 1. In the case of the Hamiltonian operator, this requirement not only implies real eigenenergies but also guarantees probability conservation. Interestingly, a wide class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can still show entirely real spectra. Among these are Hamiltonians respecting parity\u2013time (P T) symmetry 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Even though the Hermiticity of quantum observables was never in doubt, such concepts have motivated discussions on several fronts in physics, including quantum field theories 8, non-Hermitian Anderson models 9 and open quantum systems 10, 11, to mention a few. Although the impact of P T symmetry in these fields is still debated, it has been recently realized that optics can provide a fertile ground where P T-related notions can be implemented and experimentally investigated 12, 13 \u2026",
