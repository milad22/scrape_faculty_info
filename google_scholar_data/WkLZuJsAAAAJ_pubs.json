            "To support researchers and designers in synthesizing and understanding the advances in search, this monograph offers a structured means to think about web search result visualization, based on an inclusive model of search that integrates information retrieval, information seeking and a higher level context of tasks and goals. We examine each of these levels of search in a survey of advances in browsers and related tools by defining search-related cognitive processes and analyzing innovative design approaches. We then discuss evaluations at each of these levels of search, presenting significant results and identifying both the traditional and novel means used to produce them. Based on this examination, we propose a taxonomy of search result visualization techniques that can be used to identify gaps for future research and as a reference for designers of next generation web search systems.",

            "When users have poorly defined or complex goals, search interfaces that offer only keyword\u2010searching facilities provide inadequate support to help them reach their information\u2010seeking objectives. The emergence of interfaces with more advanced capabilities, such as faceted browsing and result clustering, can go some way toward addressing such problems. The evaluation of these interfaces, however, is challenging because they generally offer diverse and versatile search environments that introduce overwhelming amounts of independent variables to user studies; choosing the interface object as the only independent variable in a study would reveal very little about why one design outperforms another. Nonetheless, if we could effectively compare these interfaces, then we would have a way to determine which was best for a given scenario and begin to learn why. In this article, we present a formative \u2026",

            "Temporal events, while often discrete, also have interesting relationships within and across times: larger events are often collections of smaller more discrete events (battles within wars; artists' works within a form); events at one point also have correlations with events at other points (a play written in one period is related to its performance over a period of time). Most temporal visualisations, however, only represent discrete data points or single data types along a single timeline: this event started here and ended there; this work was published at this time; this tag was popular for this period. In order to represent richer, faceted attributes of temporal events, we present Continuum.

Although a large portion of social media content is considered to be babble, research shows that people share useful links, provide recommendations to friends, answer questions, and solve problems. In this paper, we report on a qualitative investigation into the different factors that make tweets \u2018useful\u2019and \u2018not useful\u2019for a set of common search tasks. The investigation found 16 features that help make a tweet useful, noting that useful tweets often showed 2 or 3 of these features.\u2018Not useful\u2019tweets, however, typically had only one of 17 clear and striking features. Further, we saw that these features can be weighted as according to different types of search tasks. Our results contribute a novel framework for extracting useful information from real-time streams of social-media content that will be used in the design of a future retrieval system.",

There are people who study good user interface design, and  people who design aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. There are also  people who curate and manage valuable information resources, and people who  design effective algorithms to retrieve results from them.

            "Originally grounded in library and information science, the majority of information behaviour and information-seeking theories focus on task-based scenarios where users try to resolve information needs. While other theories exist, such as how people unexpectedly encounter information, for example, they are typically related back to tasks, motivated by work or personal goals. This chapter, however, focuses on casual-leisure scenarios that are typically motivated by hedonistic needs rather than information needs, where people engage in searching behaviours for pleasure rather than to find information. This chapter describes two studies on (1) television information behaviour and (2) the casual information behaviours described by users of Twitter. The first study focuses on a specific casual-leisure domain that is familiar to many, while the second indicates that our findings generalise to many other casual-leisure \u2026",
