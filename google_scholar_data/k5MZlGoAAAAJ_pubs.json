The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high signal\u2010to\u2010noise composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, H ii regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Ly\u03b1 equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra that are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Ly\u03b1 emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low\u2010ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Ly\u03b1 and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low\u2010 and high \u2026",

            " We present photometric observations of an apparent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at a redshift of \u223c1.7, the farthest SN observed to date. The supernova, SN 1997ff, was discovered in a repeat observation by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Hubble Deep Field\u2010North (HDF\u2010N) and serendipitously monitored with NICMOS on HST throughout the Thompson et al. Guaranteed\u2010Time Observer (GTO) campaign. The SN type can be determined from the host galaxy type: an evolved, red elliptical lacking enough recent star formation to provide a significant population of core\u2010collapse supernovae. The classification is further supported by diagnostics available from the observed colors and temporal behavior of the SN, both of which match a typical SN Ia. The photometric record of the SN includes a dozen flux measurements in the I, J, and H bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. The redshift derived from \u2026",

            "We present the basic data for a large ground\u2010based spectroscopic survey for   Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), photometrically selected using rest\u2010UV colors from very deep images in 17 high Galactic latitude fields. The total survey covers an area of 0.38 deg2 and includes 2347 photometrically selected candidate LBGs to an apparent \u211bAB magnitude limit of 25.5. Approximately half of these objects have been observed spectroscopically using the Keck telescopes, yielding 940 redshifts with  . We discuss the images, photometry, target selection, and spectroscopic program in some detail and present catalogs of the photometric and spectroscopic data, made available in electronic form. We discuss the general utility of conducting nearly volume\u2010limited redshift surveys in prescribed redshift intervals using judicious application of photometric preselection.",

PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z~ 1.2 and 2.2, with log (M*(M\u2609))\u2265 10.4 and log (SFR (M\u2609\/yr))\u2265 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M*-SFR plane, and adopting a\" Galactic\" value for the CO-H 2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of~ 0.33 at z~ 1.2 and~ 0.47 at z~ 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z~ 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV\/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z= 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a~ 0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes \u2026",
