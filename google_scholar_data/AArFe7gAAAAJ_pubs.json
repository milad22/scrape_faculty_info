            "The identification of stem-cell-like cancer cells through conventional methods that depend on stem cell markers is often unreliable. We developed a mechanical method for selecting tumorigenic cells by culturing single cancer cells in fibrin matrices of~ 100 Pa in stiffness. When cultured within these gels, primary human cancer cells or single cancer cells from mouse or human cancer cell lines grew within a few days into individual round colonies that resembled embryonic stem cell colonies. Subcutaneous or intravenous injection of 10 or 100 fibrin-cultured cells in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency mice led to the formation of solid tumours at the site of injection or at the distant lung organ much more efficiently than control cancer cells selected using conventional surface marker methods or cultured on conventional rigid dishes or on soft gels. Remarkably, as few as ten such cells were able to survive \u2026",

            "Both DNA and RNA can serve as powerful building blocks for bottom-up fabrication of nanostructures. A pioneering concept proposed by Ned Seeman 30 years ago has led to an explosion of knowledge in DNA nanotechnology. RNA can be manipulated with simplicity characteristic of DNA, while possessing noncanonical base-pairing, versatile function, and catalytic activity similar to proteins. However, standing in awe of the sensitivity of RNA to RNase degradation has made many scientists flinch away from RNA nanotechnology. Here we report the construction of stable RNA nanoparticles resistant to RNase digestion. The 2\u2032-F (2\u2032-fluoro) RNA retained its property for correct folding in dimer formation, appropriate structure in procapsid binding, and biological activity in gearing the phi29 nanomotor to package viral DNA and producing infectious viral particles.

Beyond all these roles, mast cells are now more and more being recognized as modulators of tumor microenvironment. Notwithstanding mounting evidences of mast cell accumulation in tumors, their exact role in tumor microenvironment is still incompletely understood. In this review, we discuss the significant role of mast cells in the remodeling of tumor microenvironment by either releasing various factors after activation or interacting with other cells within tumor and, as a result, the possible role of mast cell in cancer invasion and metastasis. We also discuss recent findings that mast cells actively release microparticles, which account for the transfer of membrane-type receptor signal and regulatory molecules such as microRNAs to tumor \u2026",

However, the mechanism of physiologic formation of LXA4 remains elusive. In this report, we provide evidence that platelet-derived microparticles contain lipoxygenase 12 (12-LO) protein and act as a mediator in transferring 12-LO to mast cells, leading to the production of LXA4 by mast cells. Absence of either leukotriene, the precursor for LXA4, in mast cells or 12-LO in microparticles abolished LXA4 production. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that platelet-derived microparticles were taken up by peritoneal mast cells in vivo and triggered LXA4 production. We also found that similar to LXA4, platelet-derived microparticles attenuated LPS- or dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation by regulating inflammatory cytokines. Together \u2026",

We showed here that the transferrin receptor (TfR) was a suitable surface marker for targeting of gene therapy in MM and that the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) was an attractive therapeutic molecular target in MM. We observed that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 blocked cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in vitro.
