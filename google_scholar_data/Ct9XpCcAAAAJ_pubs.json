            "The discovery of the quantum Hall (QH) effect led to the realization of a topological electronic state with dissipationless currents circulating in one direction along the edge of a two-dimensional electron layer under a strong magnetic field 1, 2. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect shares a similar physical phenomenon to that of the QH effect, whereas its physical origin relies on the intrinsic spin\u2013orbit coupling and ferromagnetism 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Here, we report the experimental observation of the QAH state in V-doped (Bi, Sb) 2 Te 3 films with the zero-field longitudinal resistance down to 0.00013\u00b10.00007h\/e 2 (~ 3.35\u00b11.76 \u03a9), Hall conductance reaching 0.9998\u00b10.0006e 2\/h and the Hall angle becoming as high as 89.993\u00b10.004 at T= 25 mK.

We demonstrated in this work, the quantification of the coexistence of strain and surface charge mediated magnetoelectric coupling on ultra-thin Ni 0.79 Fe 0.21\/PMN-PT interface by using a Ni 0.79 Fe 0.21\/Cu\/PMN-PT heterostructure with only strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling as a control.
