            "Good team players are often defined in trait terms; that is, they are described as dependable, flexible, or cooperative. Our goal is to examine the relationship between team member personality traits and team effectiveness. However, to understand the effects of personality on team performance requires greater specificity in how personality is described and in how team effectiveness is described. A hierarchical model of team member personality is presented that defines higher-level personality traits and specific facets relevant to team performance. Next, a classification of the core teamwork dimensions underlying effective team performance is presented. Finally, predictions are derived linking team member personality facets to specific teamwork requirements.(PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

This has limited the extent to which Bass's (1985) argument that optimally effective leaders engage in both types of behavior can be directly assessed. Pattern-oriented analyses were used here to discern which behavioral pattern was associated with the highest levels of subordinate satisfaction and commitment. In general, optimally effective leaders used a combination of transformational and contingent reward (e.g. exchange-based transactional leadership) behaviors, coupled with a low level of passive management-by-exception behavior (e.g. remaining uninvolved until problems emerge).",

Across the different criteria, team-focused commitment tended to be a stronger predictor of performance than military-oriented commitment did. However, military-oriented commitment was inversely related to supervisory ratings of soldiers' negative behaviors.
