            "For molecules in high intensity oscillating electric fields, the time-dependent Hartree\u2013Fock (TDHF) method is used to simulate the behavior of the electronic density prior to ionization. Since a perturbative approach is no longer valid at these intensities, the full TDHF equations are used to propagate the electronic density. A unitary transform approach is combined with the modified midpoint method to provide a stable and efficient algorithm to integrate these equations. The behavior of H2+ in an intense oscillating field computed using the TDHF method with a STO-3G basis set reproduces the analytic solution for the two-state coherent excitation model. For H2 with a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set, the TDHF results are nearly indistinguishable from calculations using the full time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

            "High-harmonic generation is a universal response of matter to strong femtosecond laser fields, coherently upconverting light to much shorter wavelengths. Optimizing the conversion of laser light into soft x-rays typically demands a trade-off between two competing factors. Because of reduced quantum diffusion of the radiating electron wave function, the emission from each species is highest when a short-wavelength ultraviolet driving laser is used. However, phase matching\u2014the constructive addition of x-ray waves from a large number of atoms\u2014favors longer-wavelength mid-infrared lasers. We identified a regime of high-harmonic generation driven by 40-cycle ultraviolet lasers in waveguides that can generate bright beams in the soft x-ray region of the spectrum, up to photon energies of 280 electron volts. Surprisingly, the high ultraviolet refractive indices of both neutral atoms and ions enabled effective phase \u2026",

            "Electronic processes leading to dissociative ionization of polyatomic molecules in strong laser fields are investigated experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Using time-of-flight ion mass spectroscopy, we study the dependence of fragmentation on laser intensity for a series of related molecules and report regular trends in this dependence on the size, symmetry, and electronic structure of a molecule. Based on these data, we develop a model of dissociative ionization of polyatomic molecules in intense laser fields. The model is built on three elements:(i) nonadiabatic population transfer from the ground electronic state to the excited-state manifold via a doorway (charge-transfer) transition;(ii) exponential enhancement of this transition by collective dynamic polarization of all electrons, and (iii) sequential energy deposition in both neutral molecules and resulting molecular ions.

Both static and frequency-dependent properties are required to understand the optical response of molecules and their ions interacting with laser fields. It is particularly important to understand the dynamics of the optical response of multielectron systems in the near-IR (\u03bb \u223c 800 nm) region, where the majority of strong-field experiments are performed.

The asymmetries, measured as a function of the proton momentum transfer, possess greater precision than previous \u03c0 0 measurements and are the first \u03b7 measurements in this energy regime. The results are compared with theoretical predictions based on t-channel, quasiparticle exchange and constrain the axial-vector component of the neutral meson production mechanism in these models.",
