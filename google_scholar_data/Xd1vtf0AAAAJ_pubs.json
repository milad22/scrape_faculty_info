            "The problem of discriminating among given nonorthogonal quantum states is underlying many of the schemes that have been suggested for quantum communication and quantum computing. However, quantum mechanics puts severe limitations on our ability to determine the state of a quantum system. In particular, nonorthogonal states cannot be discriminated perfectly, even if they are known, and various strategies for optimum discrimination with respect to some appropriately chosen criteria have been developed. In this article we review recent theoretical progress regarding the two most important optimum discrimination strategies. We also give a detailed introduction with emphasis on the relevant concepts of the quantum theory of measurement. After a brief introduction into the field, the second chapter deals with optimum unambiguous, i. e error-free, discrimination. Ambiguous \u2026",

The first builds on earlier results for the two-path interferometer, which used minimum-error state discrimination between detector states to provide the path information. For visibility, which was used in the two-path case, we substitute a recently defined l 1 measure of quantum coherence. The second is an entropic relation in which the path information is characterized by the mutual information between the detector states and the outcome of the measurement performed on them, and the coherence measure is one based on relative entropy.",

Since the achieved visibility depends on the specific sorting scheme, we optimize the sorting procedure under general circumstances.

After processing the information it has to be read out what is equivalent to determining the final state of the system. When the possible final states are not orthogonal this is a highly nontrivial task that constitutes the general area of what is known as quantum state discrimination. It consists in finding measurement schemes that, according to some figure of merit, will determine the state of the system. Optimized measurement schemes often lead to generalized measurements (Positive Operator Valued Measures [POVMs]).

            "There are presently two models for quantum walks on graphs. The \u201ccoined\u201d walk uses discrete-time steps, and contains, besides the particle making the walk, a second quantum system, the coin, that determines the direction in which the particle will move. The continuous walk operates with continuous time. Here a third model for quantum walks is proposed, which is based on an analogy to optical interferometers. It is a discrete-time model, and the unitary operator that advances the walk one step depends only on the local structure of the graph on which the walk is taking place. This type of walk also allows us to introduce elements, such as phase shifters, that have no counterpart in classical random walks. Several examples are discussed.",
