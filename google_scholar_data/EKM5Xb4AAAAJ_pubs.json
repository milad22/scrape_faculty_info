            "The chemical reactivity of different surfaces of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) has been the subject of extensive studies in recent decades. The anatase TiO 2 (001) and its (1\u00d7 4) reconstructed surfaces were theoretically considered to be the most reactive and have been heavily pursued by synthetic chemists. However, the lack of direct experimental verification or determination of the active sites on these surfaces has caused controversy and debate. Here we report a systematic study on an anatase TiO 2 (001)-(1\u00d7 4) surface by means of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques in combination with first-principles calculations. Two types of intrinsic point defects are identified, among which only the Ti 3+ defect site on the reduced surface demonstrates considerable chemical activity. The perfect surface itself can be fully oxidized, but shows no obvious activity. Our findings suggest that the reactivity of the anatase TiO 2 (001 \u2026",

            "Clean hydrogen production is highly desirable for future energy needs, making the understanding of molecular-level phenomena underlying photocatalytic hydrogen production both fundamentally and practically important. Water splitting on pure TiO2 is inefficient, however, adding sacrificial methanol could significantly enhance the photocatalyzed H2 production. Therefore, understanding the photochemistry of methanol on TiO2 at the molecular level could provide important insights to its photocatalytic activity. Here, we report the first clear evidence of photocatalyzed splitting of methanol on TiO2 derived from time-dependent two-photon photoemission (TD-2PPE) results in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). STM tip induced molecular manipulation before and after UV light irradiation clearly reveals photocatalytic bond cleavage, which occurs only at Ti4+ surface sites. TD-2PPE reveals that the \u2026",

            "A knowledge of adsorption behaviors of oxygen on the model system of the reduced rutile TiO2(110)-1\u00d71 surface is of great importance for an atomistic understanding of many chemical processes. We present a scanning tunneling microcopy (STM) study on the adsorption of molecular oxygen either at the bridge-bonded oxygen vacancies (BBOV) or at the hydroxyls (OH) on the TiO2(110)-1\u00d71 surface. Using an in situ O2 dosing method, we are able to directly verify the exact adsorption sites and the dynamic behaviors of molecular O2. Our experiments provide direct evidence that an O2 molecule can intrinsically adsorb at both the BBOV and the OH sites. It has been identified that, at a low coverage of O2, the singly adsorbed molecular O2 at BBOV can be dissociated through an intermediate state as driven by the STM tip. However, singly adsorbed molecular O2 at OH can survive from such a tip-induced effect \u2026",

However, a long-standing puzzling question in understanding the reaction sequence of the water splitting is whether the initial reaction step is a photocatalytic process and how it happens. Here, using the low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) performed at 80 K, we observed the dissociation of individually adsorbed water molecules at the 5-fold coordinated Ti (Ti5c) sites of the reduced TiO2 (110)-1 \u00d7 1 surface under the irradiation of UV lights with the wavelength shorter than 400 nm, or to say its energy larger than the band gap of 3.1 eV for the rutile TiO2. This finding thus clearly suggests the involvement of a photocatalytic dissociation process that produces two kinds of hydroxyl species. One \u2026",

            "Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with semiconductor substrates introduces strong optical resonances that extend and enhance the spectrum of photocatalytic and photovoltaic activity. The effect of plasmonic resonances has been variously attributed to the field nanoconfinement, plasmon\u2013exciton coupling, hot electron transfer, and so on, based on action spectra of enhanced photoactivity. It remains unclear, however, whether energized carriers in the substrate are generated by the transfer of plasmonically generated hot electrons from the metal, as broadly believed, or directly by dephasing of the plasmonic field at the interface. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the direct plasmonic coupling across the chemical interface for hot electron generation at a prototypical Ag nanocluster\/TiO 2 heterojunction by direct probing of the coherence and hot electron dynamics with two-photon photoemission spectroscopy \u2026",

The highly relevant photocatalytic substrate for CO 2 conversion could be the popular TiO 2 surfaces. However, the lack of accurate measurements for the energy level alignment that determines the CO 2 reduction on TiO 2 has limited our ability to control these complicated photocatalysis processes. We report here a systematic study on the reduction of CO 2 at specific sites of the rutile TiO 2 (110)-1\u00d7 1 surface using scanning tunneling microscopy at 80 K. The dissociation of CO 2 molecules is found to be activated by one electron attachment process with an energy threshold of 1.8 eV above the Fermi level (or 1.4 eV above the TiO 2 conduction band onset), while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the adsorbed CO 2 is located at 2.3 eV with \u2026",

In comparison with those of the fivefold coordinated Ti atoms and the oxygen vacancies, the relative apparent height of OHs becomes smaller and smaller with decreasing tip\u2212sample distance by changing the imaging conditions.

Here we deposit Ag nanoclusters (NC) on Gr to study the ultrafast hot electron generation and dynamics in their plasmonic heterojunctions by means of time-resolved two-photon photoemission (2PP) spectroscopy.
