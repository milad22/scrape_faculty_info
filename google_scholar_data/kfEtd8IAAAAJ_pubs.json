            "We report the white light flare rates for 10 ultracool dwarfs using Kepler K2 short-cadence data. Among our sample stars, two have spectral type M6, three are M7, three are M8, and two are L0. Most of our targets are old low-mass stars. We identify a total of 283 flares in all of the stars in our sample, with Kepler energies in the range log E Kp~(29\u201333.5) erg. Using the maximum-likelihood method of line fitting, we find that the flare frequency distribution (FFD) for each star in our sample follows a power law with slope\u2212 \u03b1 in the range\u2212(1.3\u20132.0). We find that cooler objects tend to have shallower slopes. For some of our targets, the FFD follows either a broken power law, or a power law with an exponential cutoff. For the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we find a very shallow slope (\u2212 \u03b1=\u2212 1.3) in the Kepler energy range (0.82\u2013130)\u00d7 10 30 erg: this L0 dwarf has flare rates which are comparable to those of high \u2026",

            "Observations of solar and stellar flares have revealed the presence of power-law dependences between the flare energy and the time interval between flares. Various models have been proposed to explain these dependences and the numerical value of the power-law indices. Here, we propose a model in which convective flows in granules force the footpoints of coronal magnetic loops, which are frozen-in to photospheric gas, to undergo a random walk. In certain conditions, this can lead to a twist in the loop, which drives the loop unstable if the twist exceeds a critical value. The possibility that a solar flare is caused by such a twist-induced instability in a loop has been in the literature for decades. Here, we quantify the process in an approximate way with a view to replicating the power-law index. We find that, for relatively small flares, the random walk twisting model leads to a rather steep power-law slope that \u2026",

The source is a typical L1 dwarf at a distance of~ 50 pc, probably an old hydrogen-burning star rather than a young brown dwarf.

The total equivalent duration of the flare is 15.4 hr. We estimate that the total bolometric energy of the flare was 4\u00d7 10 33 erg, more powerful than the previously reported Kepler white light flares for the L1 dwarf WISEP J190648. 47+ 401106.8, but weaker than the \u0394V=\u2212 11 L0 dwarf superflare ASASSN-16ae.

In view of this association, there has been an expectation that, by scaling from solar flares to the flares that are observed on M dwarfs, radio emission analogous to solar type II bursts should be detectable in association with M dwarf flares. However, several surveys have revealed that this expectation does not seem to be fulfilled. Here we hypothesize that the presence of larger global field strengths in low-mass stars, suggested by recent magnetoconvective modeling, gives rise to such large Alfv\u00e9n speeds in the corona that it becomes difficult to satisfy the conditions for the generation of type II radio bursts. As a result, CMEs propagating in the corona\/wind of flare stars are expected to be\" radio-quiet\" as regards type II bursts. In view of this, we suggest that, in the context of type II bursts, scaling from solar to stellar \u2026",
