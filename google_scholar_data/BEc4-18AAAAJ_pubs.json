            "Recent research results have failed to support the conventionally held belief that students learn physics best from hands-on experiences with physical equipment. Rather, studies have found that students who perform similar experiments with computer simulations perform as well or better on measures of conceptual understanding than their peers who used physical equipment. In this study, we explored how university-level nonscience majors\u2019 understanding of the physics concepts related to pulleys was supported by experimentation with real pulleys and a computer simulation of pulleys. We report that when students use one type of manipulative (physical or virtual), the comparison is influenced both by the concept studied and the timing of the post-test. Students performed similarly on questions related to force and mechanical advantage regardless of the type of equipment used. On the other hand, students who \u2026",

We investigated how students' ideas about pulleys were influenced by the use of physical and virtual manipulatives. We found that there were advantages for each type of manipulative, and that virtual and physical manipulatives helped students develop correct understandings of different concepts. We also found that the order the manipulatives were used affected student learning, with students who used real pulleys before the simulation achieving higher scores on questions having to do with effort force, the distance the rope is pulled, and mechanical advantage.",

Thus, while TAs may still be in the process of developing their views on teaching physics, their practices directly influence a large number of introductory students. As the first steps in reforming our introductory courses and TA training program, we collected multiple types of data on TAs teaching in traditional algebra-based physics laboratories. Drawing on prior work on TAs' pedagogical knowledge, we explore how the beliefs expressed by TAs in interviews align with their practices during a laboratory video-taped mid-semester. Additionally, we explore how both the TAs' expressed beliefs and practices align with students' responses to an end-of-semester TA evaluation survey.",

We compared pre-, mid-and post-test scores of two treatment groups, which differed by the temporal order in which the physical and virtual activities were completed. We examined overall scores as well as scores on individual questions. In questions dealing with the concept of work, students who performed the virtual experiment first seemed to have blocked information learned in the physical. In questions about force, students in each treatment group showed similar gains from pre-to mid-test but from mid-to post-test there was no gain, consistent with the primacy effect. Further, students who performed the physical experiment first did better on force mid-test questions, consistent with advantages of kinesthetic learning.In this study we investigate the effects of sequence of physical and virtual activities on student learning of various concepts in physics. The affordances and limitations of physical laboratory experiments and computer simulation activities have increasingly been described in science education research (De Jong & Van Joolingen, 1998; Finkelstein, et al., 2005; Triona & Klahr, 2003; Klahr, Triona, & Williams, 2007; Zacharia & Constantinou, 2008; Zacharia, Olympiou, & Papaevripidou, 2008). It has been shown that there are many advantages and disadvantages to using each type of manipulative. Klahr, Triona, & Williams (2007) reported that learning with a physical manipulative is advantageous as it is consistent with the concreteto-abstract nature of cognitive development, because it increases student \u2026",
