Assuming the neutrino to be a Majorana particle, we show that smallness of its mass can be understood as a result of the observed maximality of parity violation in low-energy weak interactions. This result is shown to be independent of the number of generations and unaffected by renormalization effects. Phenomenological consequences of this model at low energies are studied. Observation of neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay will provide a crucial test of this class of models. Implications for rare decays such as \u03bc\u2192 e \u03b3, \u03bc\u2192 ee e, etc. are also noted.

            "The recent groundbreaking discovery of nonzero neutrino masses and oscillations has put the spotlight on massive neutrinos as one of the key windows on physics beyond the standard model as well as into the early universe. This third edition of the invaluable book Massive Neutrinos in Physics and Astrophysics is an introduction to the various issues related to the theory and phenomenology of massive neutrinos for the nonexpert, providing at the same time a complete and up-to-date discussion on the latest results in the field for the active researcher. It is designed not merely to be a guide but also as a self-contained tool for research with all the necessary techniques and logics included. Specially emphasized are the various implications of neutrino discoveries for the nature of new forces. Elementary discussions on topics such as grand unification, left-right symmetry and supersymmetry are presented. The most recent cosmological and astrophysical implications of massive neutrinos are also dealt with.",

In the context of two dimensinal string world sheet, supersymmetry was also introduced around the same time by Gervais and Sakita. In addition to the obvious fact that it provides the hope of an unified understanding of the two known forms of matter, the bosons and fermions, it has also provided a mechanism to solve two conceptual problems of the standard model, viz. the possible origin of the weak scale as well as its stability under quantum corrections. The recent developments in strings, which embody supersymmetry in an essential way also promise the fulfilment of the eternal dream of all \u2026",
