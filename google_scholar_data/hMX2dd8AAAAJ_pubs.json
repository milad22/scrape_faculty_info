            "We study the formalism of the sphaleron approximation to baryon-number violation in the standard model at temperatures near 1 TeV. We investigate small fluctuations of the sphaleron, the competition of large-scale sphalerons with thermal fluctuations, and the damping of the transition rate in the plasma. We find a suppression of the rate due to Landau damping and due to factors arising from zero modes. Our approximations are valid in the regime 2 M W (T)\u226a T\u226a 2 M W (T)\/\u03b1 W for models where \u03bb\u223c g 2. We find that the rate of baryon-number violation is still significantly larger than the expansion rate of the Universe.",

Working in the Landau gauge, we present a calculation of the dominant two-loop corrections to the ring-improved one-loop potential in the formal limit g 4\u226a \u03bb\u226a g 2, where \u03bb is the Higgs self-coupling and g is the electroweak coupling. The limit \u03bb\u226a g 2 ensures that the phase transition is significantly first order, and the limit g 4\u226a \u03bb allows us to use high-temperature expansions. We find corrections from 20% to 40% at Higgs-boson masses relevant to the bound computed for baryogenesis in the minimal standard model. Though our numerical results seem to still rule out minimal standard model baryogenesis, this conclusion is not airtight because the loop expansion is only marginal when corrections are as big as 40%.

            "The emission rate of photons from a hot, weakly coupled ultrarelativistic plasma is analyzed. Leading-log results, reflecting the sensitivity of the emission rate to scattering events with momentum transfers from gT to T, have previously been obtained. But a complete leading-order treatment requires including collinearly enhanced, inelastic processes such as bremsstrahlung. These inelastic processes receive O (1) modifications from multiple scattering during the photon emission process, which limits the coherence length of the emitted radiation (the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect). We perform a diagrammatic analysis to identify, and sum, all leading-order contributions. We find that the leading-order photon emission rate is not sensitive to non-perturbative g 2 T scale dynamics. We derive an integral equation for the photon emission rate which is very similar to the result of Migdal in his original discussion of the \u2026",

This includes qg, gg, and singlet q q+ qq collisions in addition to the usual non-singlet q q+ qq. The primary motivation is the importance of quark-gluon collisions at Tevatron energies. Attention is restricted to high and moderate q T, avoiding the resummation necessary at small transverse momentum. We give analytic results for all constituent cross-sections d\u03c3\/dq T 2 d y and, for W and Z production, numerically convolute them with structure functions.",
