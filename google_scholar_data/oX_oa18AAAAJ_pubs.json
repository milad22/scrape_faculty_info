            "The coalescence of two black holes generates gravitational waves that carry detailed information about the properties of those black holes and their binary configuration. The final coalescence cycles are in the form of a ringdown: a superposition of quasinormal modes of the merged remnant black hole. Each mode has an oscillation frequency and decay time that in general relativity is determined by the remnant\u2019s mass and spin. Measuring the frequency and decay time of multiple modes makes it possible to measure the remnant\u2019s mass and spin, and to test the waves against the predictions of gravity theories. In this Letter, we show that the relative amplitudes of these modes encode information about a binary\u2019s geometry. Focusing on the large mass-ratio limit, which provides a simple-to-use tool for effectively exploring parameter space, we demonstrate how a binary\u2019s geometry is encoded in the relative amplitudes \u2026",

            "The last gravitational waves emitted in the coalescence of two black holes are quasinormal ringing modes of the merged remnant. In general relativity, the mass and the spin of the remnant black hole uniquely determine the frequency and damping time of each radiated mode. The amplitudes of these modes are determined by the mass ratio of the system and the geometry of the coalescence. This paper is part I of an analysis that aims to compute the \u201cexcitation factors\u201d associated with misaligned binary black hole coalescence. To simplify the analysis, we consider a large mass-ratio system consisting of a nonspinning body of mass \u03bc that inspirals on a quasicircular trajectory into a Kerr black hole of mass M and spin parameter a, with \u03bc\/M\u226a 1. Our goal is to understand how different modes are excited as a function of the black hole spin a and an angle I which characterizes the misalignment of the orbit with the black \u2026",

The last cycles of these waveforms are a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes. In this paper, we examine how the modes\u2019 excitations vary as a function of source parameters, such as the larger black hole\u2019s spin and the geometry of the smaller body\u2019s inspiral and plunge. We find that the mixture of quasinormal modes that characterize the final gravitational waves from a coalescence is entirely determined by the spin a of the larger black hole, an angle I which characterizes the misalignment of the orbital plane from the black hole\u2019s spin axis, a second angle \u03b8 fin which describes the location at which the small body crosses the black hole\u2019s event horizon, and the direction sgn (\u03b8 fin) of the body\u2019s final motion.

            "The electron-phonon interaction (EPI) is instrumental in a wide variety of phenomena in solid-state physics, such as electrical resistivity in metals, carrier mobility, optical transition, and polaron effects in semiconductors, lifetime of hot carriers, transition temperature in BCS superconductors, and even spin relaxation in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers for quantum information processing. However, due to the weak EPI strength, most phenomena have focused on electronic properties rather than on phonon properties. One prominent exception is the Kohn anomaly, where phonon softening can emerge when the phonon wave vector nests the Fermi surface of metals. Here we report a new class of Kohn anomaly in a topological Weyl semimetal (WSM), predicted by field-theoretical calculations, and experimentally observed through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering on WSM tantalum phosphide.
