            "The discovery of graphene 1, 2 raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties 3, 4, 5, 6 of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm 2 V\u2212 1 s\u2212 1 for carrier densities below 5\u00d7 10 9 cm\u2212 2. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a \u2026",

The first experimental evidence of the two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence of plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an applied magnetic field 1, 2. These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum Hall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the charge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is qualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue 3. As a third distinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions and correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly, evidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking.

            "Electronic instabilities at the crossing of the Fermi energy with a Van Hove singularity 1 in the density of states often lead to new phases of matter such as superconductivity 2, 3, magnetism 4 or density waves 5. However, in most materials this condition is difficult to control. In the case of single-layer graphene, the singularity is too far from the Fermi energy 6 and hence difficult to reach with standard doping and gating techniques 7. Here we report the observation of low-energy Van Hove singularities in twisted graphene layers seen as two pronounced peaks in the density of states measured by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. We demonstrate that a rotation between stacked graphene layers can generate Van Hove singularities, which can be brought arbitrarily close to the Fermi energy by varying the angle of rotation. This opens intriguing prospects for Van Hove singularity engineering of electronic phases.",

For twist angles exceeding\u223c 3 the low energy carriers exhibit Landau level spectra characteristic of massless Dirac fermions. Above 20 the layers effectively decouple and the electronic properties are indistinguishable from those in single-layer graphene, while for smaller angles we observe a slowdown of the carrier velocity which is strongly angle dependent. At the smallest angles the spectra are dominated by twist-induced van Hove singularities and the Dirac fermions eventually become localized.

By comparing the measured gate dependence of the proximity induced subgap features (multiple Andreev reflections) and of the supercurrent to theoretical predictions, we find that the diffusive junction model yields close quantitative agreement with the results. By contrast, predictions of the ballistic SGS model are inconsistent with the data. We show that all SGS devices reported so far, our own as well as those of other groups, fall in the diffusive junction category.

            "Transport studies in a Corbino disk suggest that the Bragg glass phase undergoes a first-order transition into a disordered solid. This transition shows sharp reentrant behavior at low fields. In contrast, in the conventional strip configuration, the phase transition is obscured by the injection of the disordered vortices through the sample edges, which results in the commonly observed vortex instabilities and smearing of the peak effect in NbSe 2 crystals. These features are found to be absent in the Corbino geometry in which the circulating vortices do not cross the sample edges.",
