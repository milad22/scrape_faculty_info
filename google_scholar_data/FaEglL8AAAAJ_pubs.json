Complex impedance measurements, as a function of temperature and frequency are performed on 10 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocrystalline samples with grain sizes ranging from 900 to 17 nm. Bulk ionic conductivity decreases dramatically for grain sizes below 100 nm, although its activation energy is essentially independent of grain size. The results are interpreted in terms of a space-charge layer resulting from segregation of mobile oxygen vacancies to the grain-boundary core. The thickness of this space-charge layer formed at the grain boundaries is on the order of 1 nm for large micron-sized grains but extends up to 7 nm when decreasing the grain size down to 17 nm. This gives rise to oxygen vacancies depletion over a large volume fraction of the grain and consequently to a \u2026",

We show that varying the oxygen content, the scaling analysis reveals a crossover from three-dimensional (3D) to a pure 2D VG transition with T g= 0. At small oxygen deficiencies (7\u2212 \u03b4= 6.75), the \u03c1\u2212 j curves scale according to the 3D VG model, which cannot be distinguished from a Bose-glass model from a scaling analysis with the magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis. At a lower oxygen content (7\u2212 \u03b4= 6.48), the VG phase transition behaves analogous to the highly anisotropic Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 samples, showing a quasi-2D VG transition. For further deoxygenated samples (7\u2212 \u03b4= 6.4), the result is consistent with a pure 2D vortex-glass model similar to that observed in the even more anisotropic Tl 2 Ba 2 CaCu 2 O \u2026",

            "We have studied the effect of He+ irradiation on the electrical resistivity and Curie temperature of ferromagnetic SrRuO3 thin films. An evolution from metallic to insulating behavior is observed when He+ ion fluence is increased, suggesting a metal\u2013insulator transition. Damage by ion irradiation produces a strong decrease of the Curie temperature. On the other hand, no significant change in Tc (\u223c160 K) takes place in fresh samples grown at different substrate temperatures. We discuss the possible correlation between structural changes induced by irradiation, which reflect in an increase of the pseudocubic lattice parameter, and the observed depression of Tc.",
