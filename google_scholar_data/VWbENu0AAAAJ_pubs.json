The higher temperature PL spectra can be fitted quantitatively with a thermalized carrier distribution and a broadened joint-density-of-states. The low temperature PL line shapes suggest that carriers are not thermalized, as a result of localization by band-gap fluctuations. We deduce a localization energy of \u223c7 meV as compared with an activation energy of \u223c63 meV from thermal quenching of the PL intensity. We thus conclude that this activation energy and the band-gap fluctuation most likely have different origins.",

Lifetimes up to 19 \u03bc s have been measured. The magnetic field dependence of T 1 shows a nonmonotonic behavior, where the spin lifetime first increases, then decreases, then increases again with field. The initial increase in T 1 is understood to be due to correlation between electrons localized on donors. The decrease in T 1 is likely due to phonon-related spin-orbit relaxation. The final increase in T 1 with B indicates a suppression of the spin-orbit relaxation that may involve a level-crossing related cusp in the Rashba or Dresselhaus contributions to relaxation, or may arise from an unknown source.",

The dominant dephasing mechanism, which is the hyperfine interaction of localized electrons with lattice nuclei, is discussed. Our results are presented in the context of our larger goal, which is to use resonance techniques for spin measurements and control. In this context, the Hanle spin lifetime measurement is a necessary step to be followed by optically detected magnetic resonance in a longitudinal magnetic field.",
