            "In high-temperature superconductivity, the process that leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, the fundamental charge carriers in any superconductor, remains mysterious. We used a femtosecond laser pump pulse to perturb superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 and studied subsequent dynamics using time- and angle-resolved photoemission and infrared reflectivity probes. Gap and quasiparticle population dynamics revealed marked dependencies on both excitation density and crystal momentum. Close to the d-wave nodes, the superconducting gap was sensitive to the pump intensity, and Cooper pairs recombined slowly. Far from the nodes, pumping affected the gap only weakly, and recombination processes were faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates.",

Furthermore, whereas antinodal quasiparticle excitations occur only below the transition temperature (T c), superconductivity is thought to be indifferent to nodal excitations that are regarded as robust and insensitive to T c. Here we reveal an unexpected link between nodal quasiparticles and superconductivity using high-resolution time-and angle-resolved photoemission on optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4.

Here we use time-and angle-resolved photoemission to directly measure the ultrafast response of self-energy to near-infrared photoexcitation in high-temperature cuprate superconductor.
