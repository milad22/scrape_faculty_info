            "Opiate and cocaine addictions are major social and medical problems that impose a significant burden on society. Despite the size and scope of these problems, there are few effective treatments for these addictions. Methadone maintenance is an effective and most widely used treatment for opiate addiction, allowing normalization of many physiological abnormalities caused by chronic use of short-acting opiates. There are no pharmacological treatments for cocaine addiction. Epidemiological, linkage, and association studies have demonstrated a significant contribution of genetic factors to the addictive diseases. This article reviews the molecular genetics and pharmacogenetics of opiate and cocaine addictions, focusing primarily on genes of the opioid and monoaminergic systems that have been associated with or have evidence for linkage to opiate or cocaine addiction. This evidence has been marshaled either \u2026",

High glucose induced a greater stabilization of insulin mRNA than of other poly(A) + RNAs or total cellular RNA. In RIN-5F insulinoma cells, an insulin-producing cell line, cholera toxin, but not glucose, induced a stabilization of insulin mRNA. After 24 h of culture of islets with actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin at several glucose concentrations, insulin mRNA content was decreased in comparison to controls only at higher glucose concentrations. The biosynthesis of islet proteins other than insulin was strongly decreased by actinomycin D at all glucose concentrations. Insulin biosynthesis was inhibited proportionately to the observed decreases in insulin mRNA content. We conclude that inhibition \u2026",

The impulsive violent offenders with the lowest CSF 5-HIAA concentrations have diurnal activity rhythm disturbances, and are also prone to hypoglycemia after an oral glucose challenge. Low CSF 5-HIAA combined with hyoglycemic tendency also predicts future violence under the influence of alcohol. Sons of alcoholic fathers, who have committed violent crimes, have very low CSF 5-HIAA concentrations. Vagal tone does not correlate significantly with CSF 5-HIAA but correlates with enhanced insulin secretion, which is most prominent in subjects with intermittent explosive disorder.

Results: The less common tryptophan hydroxylase U allele occurred with greater frequency in the patients who had attempted suicide.

            "To define the mechanism whereby glucose regulates islet insulin mRNA content, insulin gene transcription rates were determined in islets labeled with [3H]uridine at low (3.3) or high (17 mM) glucose. Glucose stimulated the transcription of total RNA almost 2-fold and insulin mRNA 5.6-fold. Addition of dibutyryl cAMP to islets in vitro could partially mimic the effect of glucose on insulin gene-specific transcription. In the insulin-producing RIN-5F cell line, glucose did not affect transcription, while cholera toxin acted as a secretagogue and increased total RNA and insulin gene-specific transcription as well. We conclude that glucose exerts a specific stimulatory effect on the transcription of the insulin gene(s) in normal islets and that this effect may be mediated in part by cAMP.",

            "The most common single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region of the human mu opioid receptor gene is the A118G variant, an adenine to guanine transition at nucleotide position 118 of the coding sequence of the gene. This polymorphism codes for an asparagine to aspartic acid substitution at amino acid 40 in the amino\u2010terminus, thereby removing a potential extracellular glycosylation site. Using in vitro cellular expression assays, this variant has been reported to change binding of the endogenous agonist beta\u2010endorphin and signaling of the receptor following binding of beta\u2010endorphin. Three clinical studies report that A118G genotype affects opioid antagonist\u2010mediated increases in cortisol levels. These studies demonstrate a functional role of this variant in responses to endogenous and exogenous opioids. To further characterize function, we expressed the prototype and variant receptors in two \u2026",

Two polymorphic sites were identified: A218C and A779C. The 779A allelic frequency in various populations ranged from 0.43 to 0.61 and was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the A218C site. A218C provides a site for restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. TPH mRNA was reverse-transcribed and sequenced. No aberrant splice products from the 779A or 779G TPH genes were detected nor were any other polymorphic nucleotides found.",
