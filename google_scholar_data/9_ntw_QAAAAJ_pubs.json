            "The main dietary sources of polyphenols are reviewed, and the daily intake is calculated for a given diet containing some common fruits, vegetables and beverages. Phenolic acids account for about one third of the total intake and flavonoids account for the remaining two thirds. The most abundant flavonoids in the diet are flavanols (catechins plus proanthocyanidins), anthocyanins and their oxidation products. The main polyphenol dietary sources are fruit and beverages (fruit juice, wine, tea, coffee, chocolate and beer) and, to a lesser extent vegetables, dry legumes and cereals. The total intake is \u223c1 g\/d. Large uncertainties remain due to the lack of comprehensive data on the content of some of the main polyphenol classes in food. Bioavailability studies in humans are discussed. The maximum concentration in plasma rarely exceeds 1 \u03bcM after the consumption of 10\u2013100 mg of a single phenolic compound \u2026",

            "Polyphenols are abundant micronutrients in our diet, and evidence for their role in the prevention of degenerative diseases is emerging. Bioavailability differs greatly from one polyphenol to another, so that the most abundant polyphenols in our diet are not necessarily those leading to the highest concentrations of active metabolites in target tissues. Mean values for the maximal plasma concentration, the time to reach the maximal plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, the elimination half-life, and the relative urinary excretion were calculated for 18 major polyphenols. We used data from 97 studies that investigated the kinetics and extent of polyphenol absorption among adults, after ingestion of a single dose of polyphenol provided as pure compound, plant extract, or whole food\/beverage.

This article summarizes the most interesting in vivo animal studies on the protective effects of green tea catechins against biomarkers for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other degenerative diseases. Generally, most studies using animal models show that consumption of green tea (catechins) provides some protection, although most studies have not examined dose response.

Flavonoids are generally present as glycosylated forms in plants and foods, but there is increasing evidence that the forms reaching the systemic circulation are glucuronidated, sulphated and methylated derivatives. Hence, first-pass metabolism (small intestine-liver) appears to involve a critical deglycosylation step for which the mechanisms are not known. Aims: To explore the hypothesis that deglycosylation is a prerequisite to absorption and metabolism of dietary flavonoid glycosides, to identify the enzymes responsible, and relate their specificities with absorption kinetics. Methods: Flavonoid glycoside hydrolysing enzymes were isolated from samples of human small intestine and liver using chromatographic techniques. The proteins were characterised with respect to \u2026",

Biological activity of polyphenols is often assessed by using cultured cells as tissue models; in almost all such studies, cells are treated with aglycones or polyphenol-rich extracts (derived from plants and foods), and data are reported at concentrations that elicited a response. There are 2 inherent flaws in such an approach. First, plasma and tissues are not exposed in vivo to polyphenols in these forms.

            "Lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH; EC 3.2.1.62) is a membrane\u2010bound, family 1 \u03b2\u2010glycosidase found on the brush border of the mammalian small intestine. LPH, purified from sheep small intestine, was capable of hydrolysing a range of flavonol and isoflavone glycosides. The catalytic efficiency (k cat\/K m) for the hydrolysis of quercetin\u20104\u2032\u2010glucoside, quercetin\u20103\u2010glucoside, genistein\u20107\u2010glucoside and daidzein\u20107\u2010glucoside was 170, 137, 77 and 14 (mM\u22121 s\u22121) respectively. The majority of the activity occurred at the lactase and not phlorizin hydrolase site. The ability of LPH to deglycosylate dietary (iso)flavonoid glycosides suggests a possible role for this enzyme in the metabolism of these biologically active compounds.",

            "The effect of any dietary compound is influenced by the active bioavailable dose rather than the dose ingested. Depending on the individual predisposition, including genetics and medication, a bioavailable dose may cause different magnitudes of effects in different people. Age might affect the predisposition and thus the requirements for nutrients including phytonutrients (e.g. phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenolic acids and glucosinolates). These are not essential for growth and development but to maintain body functions and health throughout the adult and later phases of life; they are \u2018lifespan essentials\u2019. Major mechanisms involved in chronic, age-related diseases include the oxidant\/antioxidant balance, but the latest research indicates indirect effects of dietary bioactives in vivo and adaptive responses in addition to direct radical scavenging.",
