            "Ubiquitination of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) terminates signaling by marking active receptors for degradation. c-Cbl, an adapter protein for RPTKs, positively regulates RPTK ubiquitination in a manner dependent on its variant SRC homology 2 (SH2) and RING finger domains. Ubiquitin-protein ligases (or E3s) are the components of ubiquitination pathways that recognize target substrates and promote their ligation to ubiquitin. The c-Cbl protein acted as an E3 that can recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, such as the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor, through its SH2 domain and that recruits and allosterically activates an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme through its RING domain. These results reveal an SH2-containing protein that functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase and thus provide a distinct mechanism for substrate targeting in the ubiquitin system.",

The biological outcome of TNF\u03b1 treatment is determined by the balance between NF-\u03baB and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling; NF-\u03baB promotes survival, whereas JNK enhances cell death. Critically, identity of a JNK substrate that promotes TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis has been outstanding. Here we show that TNF\u03b1-mediated JNK activation accelerates turnover of the NF-\u03baB-induced antiapoptotic protein c-FLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8. This is not due to direct c-FLIP phosphorylation but depends on JNK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which specifically ubiquitinates c-FLIP and induces its proteasomal degradation. JNK1 or Itch deficiency or treatment with a JNK inhibitor renders mice resistant in three distinct models of TNF\u03b1-induced acute liver failure, and cells from these mice do not \u2026",

We show here that Ca 2+-induced anergy is a multistep program that is implemented at least partly through proteolytic degradation of specific signaling proteins. Calcineurin increased mRNA and protein of the E3 ubiquitin ligases Itch, Cbl-b and GRAIL and induced expression of Tsg101, the ubiquitin-binding component of the ESCRT-1 endosomal sorting complex. Subsequent stimulation or homotypic cell adhesion promoted membrane translocation of Itch and the related protein Nedd4, resulting in degradation of two key signaling proteins, PKC-\u03b8 and PLC-\u03b31. T cells from Itch-and Cbl-b\u2013deficient mice were resistant to anergy induction.

Usually, such processes are regulated by extracellular stimuli through phosphorylation of the target protein, which allows recognition by F box\u2013containing E3 ubiquitin ligases. In the case of c-Jun and JunB, we found that extracellular stimuli also modulate protein turnover by regulating the activity of an E3 ligase by means of its phosphorylation. Activation of the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade after T cell stimulation accelerated degradation of c-Jun and JunB through phosphorylation-dependent activation of the E3 ligase Itch.

Besides indications that this p73 response is post\u2010transcriptional, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of p73 protein degradation. Ubiquitination and proteasomal\u2010dependent degradation of p53 are regulated by its transcriptional target MDM2. However, unlike p53, p73 binds to, but is not degraded by, MDM2. Here we describe the binding of p73 to Itch, a Hect ubiquitin\u2013protein ligase. Itch selectively binds and ubiquitinates p73 but not p53; this results in the rapid proteasome\u2010dependent degradation of p73. Upon DNA damage Itch itself is downregulated, allowing p73 protein levels to rise and thus interfere with p73 function. In conclusion, we have identified a key mechanism in the control of p73 protein levels both in normal as well as in stress conditions.",

            "Ubiquitin (Ub)-protein conjugation represents a novel means of posttranscriptional modification in a proteolysis-dependent or -independent manner. E3 Ub ligases play a key role in governing the cascade of Ub transfer reactions by recognizing and catalyzing Ub conjugation to specific protein substrates. The E3s, which can be generally classified into HECT-type and RING-type families, are involved in the regulation of many aspects of the immune system, including the development, activation, and differentiation of lymphocytes, T cell\u2013tolerance induction, antigen presentation, immune evasion, and virus budding. E3-promoted ubiquitination affects a wide array of biological processes, such as receptor downmodulation, signal transduction, protein processing or translocation, protein-protein interaction, and gene transcription, in addition to proteasome-mediated degradation.

            "The 14-3-3 proteins interact with diverse cellular molecules involved in various signal transduction pathways controlling cell proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis. To aid our investigation of the biological function of 14-3-3 proteins, we have set out to identify high-affinity antagonists. By screening phage display libraries, we have identified a set of peptides which bind 14-3-3 proteins. One of these peptides, termed R18, exhibited a high affinity for different isoforms of 14-3-3 with estimated KD values of 7\u22129 \u00d7 10-8 M. Recognition of multiple isoforms of 14-3-3 suggests the targeting of R18 to a structure that is common among 14-3-3 proteins, such as the conserved ligand-binding groove. Indeed, mutations that alter critical residues in the ligand-binding site of 14-3-3 drastically decreased the level of 14-3-3\u2212R18 association. R18 efficiently blocked the binding of 14-3-3 to the kinase Raf-1, a physiological ligand of \u2026",
