Analysis of dynamical quantities (such as fractal dimensions and Lyapunov exponents 3) has provided insights into low-dimensional systems; but it has proven more difficult to understand spatiotemporal chaos in high-dimensional systems, despite abundant data describing its statistical properties 1, 4, 5. Initial attempts have been made to extend the dynamical approach to higher-dimensional systems, demonstrating numerically that the spatiotemporal chaos in several simple models is extensive 6, 7, 8 (the number of dynamical degrees of freedom scales with the system volume). Here we report a computational investigation of a phenomenon found in nature,\u2018spiral defect\u2019chaos 5, 9 in Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, in which we find that the spatiotemporal chaos in this state is extensive and \u2026",

The orientational persistence length or nematic correlation length (\u03be) is evaluated using recently developed imaging and analysis methods to measure the grain size of the block copolymer microdomains. We show that the substrate can lower \u03be for block copolymers with a majority component that interacts strongly with the substrate, but this can be mitigated by attaching a buffer layer of polystyrene brushes to the substrate. In addition, we show that, for a block copolymer where the block that strongly interacts with the substrate is the minority component, the microdomain correlation length does not increase when substrates are treated with this buffer layer. We suggest that in this case the brushes do not increase \u03be not only because of the lower volume fraction of the strongly \u2026",

A mechanism for this anticorrelation is proposed with support from both experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations. Using a rough plate, velocity correlations are positive, and the velocity distribution evolves from a Gaussian at very low densities to a broader distribution at high densities. These results are interpreted as a balance between stochastic forcing, interparticle collisions, and friction with the plate.",

Detailed comparisons are provided of locally dense and balanced calculations in the gauge including atomic orbital (GIAO) method for the individual principal values, the isotropic shieldings, and the tensor orientations for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and phosphorus nuclei.

            "We describe a series of experiments and computer simulations on vibrated granular media in a geometry chosen to eliminate gravitationally induced settling. The system consists of a collection of identical spherical particles on a horizontal plate vibrating vertically, with or without a confining lid. Previously reported results are reviewed, including the observation of homogeneous, disordered liquid-like states, an instability to a'collapse'of motionless spheres on a perfect hexagonal lattice, and a fluctuating, hexagonally ordered state. In the presence of a confining lid we see a variety of solid phases at high densities and relatively high vibration amplitudes, several of which are reported for the first time in this article. The phase behaviour of the system is closely related to that observed in confined hard-sphere colloidal suspensions in equilibrium, but with modifications due to the effects of the forcing and dissipation.

            "For Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection in a square cell with a fluid of Prandtl number \u03c3\u2248 1, we report experimental results on the bistability of the spatiotemporal chaotic state of spiral defect chaos (SDC) and a stationary state of ideal straight rolls (ISR). We present the first large aspect ratio experimental confirmation of the theoretical prediction of stable ISR in the parameter regime where typical initial conditions lead to SDC. As a function of the control parameter and for typical experimental initial conditions, we also find a transition in the selection between SDC and ISR which is mediated by front propagation. We characterize the transition with two measures, the spatial correlation length and the spectral pattern entropy, and find that the transition shows similarities to equilibrium phase transitions.",
