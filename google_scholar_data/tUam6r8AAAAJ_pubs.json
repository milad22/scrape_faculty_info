            "Methanol and water crude extracts from Shiitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes) and straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) were investigated for their antioxidant capacity in three different assays, namely, the \u03b2-carotene and linoleic acid system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, and inhibition of hemolysis of rat erythrocyte induced by peroxyl radicals. Among the four mushroom extracts, the water extract from L. edodes showed the most potent radical scavenging activity in each assay, showing 75.9% (at 20 mg\/ml) in the \u03b2-carotene bleaching method, 55.4% in the DPPH radical scavenging method (at 6 mg\/ml) and 94.9% of inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis (at 5 mg\/ml). Total phenolics in the water extracts were higher than that of the methanol ones. Positive correlations were found between total phenolic content in the mushroom extracts and their antioxidant activities. Edible \u2026",

            "Mushrooms have been valued as edible and medicinal resources, and antitumor substances have been identified in many mushroom species. Polysaccharides are the best known and most potent mushroom-derived substances with antitumor and immunomodulating properties. Although the isolation process, structural characterization and antitumor activity of mushroom polysaccharides have been extensively investigated in the past three decades, the relationship between the antitumor activity and the chemical composition as well as the high order structure of their active components is still not well established. These studies are still in progress in many laboratories, and the role of polysaccharides as antitumor agent is especially under intense debate. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the available information, and to reflect the current status of this research area with a view for future direction.",
