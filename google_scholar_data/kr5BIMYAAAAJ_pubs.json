            "A Brain\u2013Computer Interface (BCI) provides a novel non-muscular communication method via brain signals. A BCI-speller can be considered as one of the first published BCI applications and has opened the gate for many advances in the field. Although many BCI-spellers have been developed during the last few decades, to our knowledge, no reviews have described the different spellers proposed and studied in this vital field. The presented speller systems are categorized according to major BCI paradigms: P300, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), and motor imagery (MI). Different BCI paradigms require specific electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features and lead to the development of appropriate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The purpose of this review is to consolidate the most successful BCI-spellers published since 2010, while mentioning some other older systems which were built explicitly for spelling purposes. We aim to assist researchers and concerned individuals in the field by illustrating the highlights of different spellers and presenting them in one review. It is almost impossible to carry out an objective comparison between different spellers, as each has its variables, parameters, and conditions. However, the gathered information and the provided taxonomy about different BCI-spellers can be helpful, as it could identify suitable systems for first-hand users, as well as opportunities of development and learning from previous studies for BCI researchers.

In the presented study, visual stimuli were displayed on Epson Moverio BT-200 augmented reality glasses, which can be easily used in smart homes. QR codes were used to identify the devices to be controlled with the BCI. In order to simulate a real life scenario, participants were instructed to go out of the lab to get a coffee. During this task light switches, elevator and a coffee machine were controlled by focusing on SSVEP stimuli displayed on the smart glasses.

            "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow humans to form a physical symbiosis with computer systems. One use case scenario of BCIs is communication by brain activity. High spelling speeds have been achieved with BCIs based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs). Typically, the flickering stimuli are presented on a standard 60 Hz monitor. Users can find VEP-based BCIs annoying and tiring due to the perceptible flickering. This is especially the case for multi-target systems designed for maximal communication speed. Higher monitor refresh rates allow a faster flickering rate for BCI targets, and thus a more subtle visual stimulation. In this paper, user friendliness and speed of c-VEP BCIs with different monitor refresh rates (60, 120 and 200 Hz) are compared. The experiment was comprised of three sessions (each consisting of training and spelling stages), one for each tested monitor refresh \u2026",

            "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) allow high communication speeds and accuracies. The fastest speeds can be achieved if targets are identified in a synchronous way (i.e., after a pre-set time period the system will produce a command output). The duration a target needs to be fixated on until the system classifies an output command affects the overall system performance. Hence, extracting a data window dedicated for the classification is of critical importance for VEP-based BCIs. Secondly, unintentional fixation on a target could easily lead to its selection. For the practical usability of BCI applications it is desirable to distinguish between intentional and unintentional fixations. This can be achieved by using threshold-based target identification methods. The study explores personalized dynamic classification time windows for threshold-based time synchronous VEP BCIs. The proposed techniques were tested employing the SSVEP and the c-VEP paradigm. Spelling performance was evaluated using an 8-target dictionary-supported BCI utilizing an n-gram word prediction model. The performance of twelve healthy participants was assessed with the information transfer rate (ITR) and accuracy. All participants completed sentence spelling tasks, reaching average accuracies of 94% and 96.3% for the c-VEP and the SSVEP paradigm, respectively. Average ITRs around 57 bpm were achieved for both paradigms.",

During last decades, the BCI-systems provided various graphical user interfaces, especially the speller interfaces. Efforts had been made to increase the speller speed and user friendliness of the system. In this paper, we are introducing a browser-driven SSVEP-based BCI web speller (accessible at: https:\/\/bci-lab.hochschule-rhein-waal.de\/en\/speller\/). This web speller can be used with the help of major existing web browsers. Thus, all the international researchers working in the field of BCI can access this web speller online free of charge, and they can run this speller using their own classifier applications. In the presented three-step web speller, the user can select a desired character by going through three different steps of the web interface.

We focused on the comparison of the accuracies and spelling times associated with each different feedback type. We tested eight different methods, one without feedback for comparison, and the two paradigms each (an increase and a decrease), for three varying parameters, during an online spelling task. The eighth method was a combination of the best performing feedback modalities. A 28 target speller was used for spelling the same word with different feedback methods.
