Because of the frustrating pairing interactions among the electron and the hole Fermi pockets, a time-reversal symmetry breaking s+ i d pairing state could be favored. We analyze this pairing state within the Ginzburg-Landau theory and explore the experimental consequences. In such a state, spatial inhomogeneity induces a supercurrent near a nonmagnetic impurity and the corners of a square sample. The resonance mode between the s\u00b1-and d x 2\u2212 y 2-wave order parameters can be detected through the B 1 g Raman spectroscopy.",

The fermion self-energy, effective mass, and Fermi velocity develop the same anisotropy at the Hartree-Fock level proportional to the interaction strength. The Landau interaction parameters in the isotropic Fermi liquids become the tridiagonal Landau interaction matrices in the dipolar Fermi liquids which renormalize thermodynamic susceptibilities. With large dipolar interaction strength, the Fermi surface collapses along directions perpendicular to the dipole orientation.

Band hybridization significantly shifts the spectral weight of the Landau interactions from the conventional s-wave channel to unconventional non-s-wave channels, which results in anisotropic (nematic) Fermi surface distortions even with ordinary interactions in solids. The Ginzburg-Landau free energy is constructed by coupling the charge-nematic, spin-nematic, and ferromagnetic order parameters together, which shows that nematic electron states can be induced by metamagnetism. The connection between this mechanism and the anisotropic metamagnetc states observed in Sr 3 Ru 2 O 7 at high magnetic fields is studied in a multiband Hubbard model with the hybridized quasi-one-dimensional d x z and d y z bands.",

Within a one-loop treatment, we find that an overdamped collective mode develops at low frequency in channels associated with quasi-one-dimensional d x z and d y z bands. When the critical point for the C 4-symmetry-broken phase (structural phase transition) is approached, the overdamped collective modes soften, and acquire increased spectral weight, resulting in non-Fermi-liquid behavior at the Fermi surface characterized by a frequency dependence of the imaginary part of the electron self-energy of the form \u03c9 \u03bb, 0< \u03bb< 1.
