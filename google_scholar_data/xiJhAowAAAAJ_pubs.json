            "Gene therapy holds great promise as a future approach to fighting disease and is explored in worldwide clinical trials. Cationic liposome (CL)\u2212DNA complexes are a prevalent nonviral delivery vector, but their efficiency requires improvement and the understanding of their mechanism of action is incomplete. As part of our effort to investigate the structure-transfection efficiency relationships of self-assembled CL\u2212DNA vectors, we have synthesized a new, highly charged (16+) multivalent cationic lipid, MVLBG2, with a dendritic headgroup. Our synthetic scheme allows facile variation of the headgroup charge and the spacer connecting hydrophobic and headgroup moieties as well as gram-scale synthesis. Complexes of DNA with mixtures of MVLBG2 and neutral 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (DOPC) exhibit the well-known lamellar phase at 90 mol % DOPC. Starting at 20 mol % dendritic lipid, however \u2026",

However, it remains underdiagnosed in contemporary clinical practice using conventional detection methods, resulting in missed opportunities to implement appropriate treatment. Newer technologies developed in recent years can potentially enhance the detection of atrial fibrillation and overcome certain limitations of the conventional methods. However, uncertainties remain about their use and the significance of atrial fibrillation detected by some of these newer technologies. This review examines the evidence supporting the use of some of these technologies and evaluates their applications in certain clinical scenarios.",

This system is subject to both passive thermal fluctuations and active scalar and vector events that are associated with free energy consumption, such as ATP hydrolysis. Scalar events drive the longitudinal viscoelastic modes (where the chromatin fiber moves relative to the solvent) while vector events generate the transverse modes (where the chromatin fiber moves together with the solvent). Using linear response methods, we derive explicit expressions for the response functions that connect the chromatin density and velocity correlation functions to the corresponding correlation \u2026",
