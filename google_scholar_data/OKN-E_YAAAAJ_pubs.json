            "To probe the dynamics and size of lipid rafts in the membrane of living cells, the local diffusion of single membrane proteins was measured. A laser trap was used to confine the motion of a bead bound to a raft protein to a small area (diam \u2264 100 nm) and to measure its local diffusion by high resolution single particle tracking. Using protein constructs with identical ectodomains and different membrane regions and vice versa, we demonstrate that this method provides the viscous damping of the membrane domain in the lipid bilayer. When glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored and transmembrane proteins are raft-associated, their diffusion becomes independent of the type of membrane anchor and is significantly reduced compared with that of nonraft transmembrane proteins. Cholesterol depletion accelerates the diffusion of raft-associated proteins for transmembrane raft proteins to the level of \u2026",

CS1 utilizes a BODIPY reporter and thioether-rich receptor to provide high selectivity and sensitivity for Cu+ over other biologically relevant metal ions, including Cu2+, in aqueous solution. This BODIPY-based probe is the first Cu+-responsive sensor with visible excitation and emission profiles and gives a 10-fold turn-on response for detecting this ion. Confocal microscopy experiments further establish that CS1 is membrane-permeable and can successfully monitor intracellular Cu+ levels within living cells. ",
