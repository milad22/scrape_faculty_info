Since thick columns have a yield stress much higher than a single-chain structure, we improve the yield stress of MR fluids by changing the fluid microstructure. Immediately after a magnetic field is applied, we compress the MR fluid along the field direction. Scanning electron microscopy images show that particle chains are pushed together to form thick columns. The shear force measured after the compression shows that the structure-enhanced static yield stress can reach as high as 800 kPa under a moderate magnetic field, while the same MR fluid has a yield stress of 80 kPa without compression. This improved yield stress increases with the magnetic field and compression pressure and has an upper limit well above 800 kPa. The method may also be useful for electrorheological fluids.",

            "Magnetorheological (MR) fluids, which can rapidly be changed from a liquid state to a solid state and vice versa by a magnetic field, have the potential to revolutionize several industrial sectors. The key issue is to enhance their yield shear stress. This paper reviews the physical mechanism and microstructure of MR fluids. It finds that the weak points of the MR microstructure under a shear force are at the chains' ends. Hence, a general technique, a compression-assisted-aggregation process, is developed to change the induced MR structure to a structure that consists of robust thick columns with strong ends. The scanning electronic micrographic (SEM) images confirm such a structure change. With this approach, MR fluids become super-strong. The enhanced yield stress of MR fluids reaches 800 kPa at a moderate magnetic field.",

The method does not change the temperature of the crude oil; instead, it temporary aggregates paraffin particles or asphaltene particles inside the crude oil into large ones. This particle aggregation changes the rheological property of the crude oil and leads to the viscosity reduction. While this viscosity reduction is not permanent, it is suitable for many important applications, such as oil transport via deepwater pipelines, since it lasts for several hours and is repeatable. ",

            "We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the ground state of electrorheological (ER) fluids in a strong electric field. Our results suggest a body-centered tetragonal (bct) lattice with conventional Bravais vectors a 1=\u221a 6 ax^, a 2=\u221a 6 ay^, and a 3= 2az^ where a is the radius of dielectric spheres and the z axis is the direction of the applied electric field. This bct lattice can be regarded as a compound of chains of class A and class B where chains of class B are obtained from chains of class A by shifting a distance of a in the z direction. For typical ER systems, this bct structure can be formed at room temperature.",
