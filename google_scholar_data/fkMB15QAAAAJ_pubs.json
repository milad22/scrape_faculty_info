            "The interaction of matter and light is one of the fundamental processes occurring in nature, and its most elementary form is realized when a single atom interacts with a single photon. Reaching this regime has been a major focus of research in atomic physics and quantum optics 1 for several decades and has generated the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics 2, 3. Here we perform an experiment in which a superconducting two-level system, playing the role of an artificial atom, is coupled to an on-chip cavity consisting of a superconducting transmission line resonator. We show that the strong coupling regime can be attained in a solid-state system, and we experimentally observe the coherent interaction of a superconducting two-level system with a single microwave photon. The concept of circuit quantum electrodynamics opens many new possibilities for studying the strong interaction of light and matter. This \u2026",

            "Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called \u201csweet spots.\u201d This latter approach led to significant improvement of T 2 times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the \u201ctransmon.\u201d Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy E J\u2215 E C. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with E J\u2215 E C, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and \u2026",

These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gate operations between an arbitrary pair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a \u2018quantum bus\u2019, which distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip.

However, the future prospects ultimately depend upon the intrinsic coherence of Josephson junctions, and whether superconducting qubits can be adequately isolated from their environment. We introduce a new architecture for superconducting quantum circuits employing a three-dimensional resonator that suppresses qubit decoherence while maintaining sufficient coupling to the control signal. With the new architecture, we demonstrate that Josephson junction qubits are highly coherent, with T 2\u223c 10 to 20 \u03bc s without the use of spin echo, and highly stable, showing no evidence for 1\/f critical current noise. These results suggest that the overall quality of Josephson junctions in these qubits will allow error rates of a few 10\u2212 4, approaching the error correction threshold.",

            "We present an experimental realization of the transmon qubit, which is an improved superconducting charge qubit derived from the Cooper pair box. We experimentally verify the predicted exponential suppression of sensitivity to 1\u2215 f charge noise. This removes the leading source of dephasing in charge qubits which results in homogeneously broadened transitions with relaxation and dephasing times in the microsecond range. Our systematic characterization of the qubit spectrum, anharmonicity, and charge dispersion shows excellent agreement with theory.",
