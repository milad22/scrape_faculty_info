            "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in promoting mitochondrial cytochrome c release and induction of apoptosis. ROS induce dissociation of cytochrome c from cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and cytochrome c may then be released via mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-dependent or MPT-independent mechanisms. We have developed peptide antioxidants that target the IMM, and we used them to investigate the role of ROS and MPT in cell death caused by t-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP) and 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). The structural motif of these peptides centers on alternating aromatic and basic amino acid residues, with dimethyltyrosine providing scavenging properties. These peptide antioxidants are cell-permeable and concentrate 1000-fold in the IMM. They potently reduced intracellular ROS and cell death caused by tBHP in neuronal N2A cells (EC50 in nm range \u2026",

            "Opioid compounds with mixed \u03bc agonist\/\u03b4 antagonist properties are expected to be analgesics with low propensity to produce tolerance and dependence. In an effort to strengthen the \u03bc agonist component of the mixed \u03bc agonist\/\u03b4 antagonist H-Tyr-Tic-Phe-Phe-NH2 (TIPP-NH2), analogues containing structurally modified tyrosine residues in place of Tyr were synthesized. Among the prepared compounds, H-Dmt-Tic-Phe-Phe-NH2 (DIPP-NH2; Dmt = 2\u2018,6\u2018-dimethyltyrosine) and H-Dmt-Tic\u03a8[CH2NH]Phe-Phe-NH2 (DIPP-NH2[\u03a8]) retained a mixed \u03bc agonist\/\u03b4 antagonist profile, as determined in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens assays, whereas H-Tmt-Tic-Phe-Phe-NH2 (Tmt = N,2\u2018,6\u2018-trimethyltyrosine) was a partial \u03bc agonist\/\u03b4 antagonist and H-Tmt-Tic\u03a8[CH2NH]Phe-Phe-NH2 was a \u03bc antagonist\/\u03b4 antagonist. DIPP-NH2[\u03a8] showed binding affinities in the subnanomolar range for both \u03bc and \u03b4 receptors in \u2026",

            "According to the membrane compartment concept the receptor specificity of ligands is based not only on ligand-receptor complementarity but also on specific ligand-membrane interactions. Elaboration of this concept for opioid pep-tide-receptor interactions had led to the assumption that \u00b5-and-receptors are located in anionic and cationic membrane compartments, respectively, and to the predictionthat positively charged opioid receptor ligands should display \u00b5-receptor selectivity. To assess the validity of thismodel, we synthesized a series of dermorphin analogues carrying a net positive charge and tested them in \u00b5-and-receptor representative binding assays and bioassays. Some but not all of the prepared compounds showed the receptor-selectivity profile expected on the basis of the membrane compartment concept.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Dysregulated miRNAs have been shown to be involved in heart diseases. This study was to examine whether miR-195 regulates palmitate-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting Sirt1, a known anti-apoptotic protein.In cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, palmitate up-regulated miR-195 expression, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and induced apoptosis as determined by up-regulation of caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of miR-195 decreased ROS production and apoptosis in palmitate-stimulated cardiomyocytes. In \u2026",
