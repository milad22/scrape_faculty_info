            "Determinations of soil moisture and sediment availability in arid regions are important indicators of local climate variability and the potential for future dust storm events. Data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) radiometer were used to derive the relationships among potential soil erosion, soil moisture, and thermal inertia (TI) at the spatial scale of aeolian landforms for the White Sands Dune Field between May 2000 and March 2008. Land surface apparent thermal inertia (ATI) data were used to derive an approximation of actual TI in order to estimate the wind threshold velocity ratio (WTR). The WTR is a ratio of the wind velocity thresholds at which soil erosion occurs for wet soil versus dry soil. The ASTER\u2010derived soil moisture retrievals and the changes through time at White Sands were interpreted to be driven primarily by precipitation, but the presence of a perched \u2026",

            "Data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) have a significant advantage over previous datasets because of the combination of high spatial resolution (15\u201390 m) and enhanced multispectral capabilities, particularly in the thermal infrared (TIR) atmospheric window (8\u201312 \u03bcm) of the Earth where common silicate minerals are more easily identified. However, the 60 km swath width of ASTER can limit the effectiveness of accurately tracing large-scale features, such as eolian sediment transport pathways, over long distances. The primary goal of this paper is to describe a method for generating a seamless and radiometrically accurate ASTER TIR mosaic of atmospherically corrected radiance and from that, extract surface emissivity for arid lands, specifically, sand seas.

However, most landform classifiers focus on crater detection, which represents only one of many geological landforms of scientific interest. In this work, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) to detect both volcanic rootless cones and transverse aeolian ridges. Our system, named MarsNet, consists of five networks, each of which is trained to detect landforms of different sizes. We compare our detection algorithm with a widely used method for image recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. We show that ConvNets can detect a wide range of landforms and has better accuracy and recall in testing data than traditional classifiers based on SVMs.",

The formation of Hrad Vallis may have been associated with catastrophic aqueous floods and volcanism, which makes determining its emplacement history important for constraining the planet's hydrological and thermal evolution during the Amazonian Period. Through geological mapping, geomorphologic analysis, and numerical simulations we assess whether Hrad Vallis formed in association with mudflows (i.e., lahars), effusive volcanism, or a combination of both processes. Among the three youngest flows in the region, the lower and upper flow units are inferred to be the products of catastrophic aqueous floods, whereas the middle unit is interpreted to be p\u0101hoehoe\u2010like lava flow formed through the process of inflation over the course of decades.
