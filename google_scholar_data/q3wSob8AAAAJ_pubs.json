            "The ability to confine and control light in three dimensions would have important implications for quantum optics and quantum-optical devices: the modification of black-body radiation, the localization of light to a fraction of a cubic wavelength, and thus the realization of single-mode light-emitting diodes, are but a few examples 1, 2, 3. Photonic crystals\u2014the optical analogues of electronic crystal\u2014provide a means for achieving these goals. Combinations of metallic and dielectric materials can be used to obtain the required three-dimensional periodic variations in dielectric constant, but dissipation due to free carrier absorption will limit application of such structures at the technologically useful infrared wavelengths 4. On the other hand, three-dimensional photonic crystals fabricated in low-loss gallium arsenide show only a weak \u2018stop band\u2019(that is, range of frequencies at which propagation of light is forbidden) at the \u2026",

However, investigation of their photonic bandgap properties is challenging, especially in the infrared and visible spectrum, as metals are dispersive and absorbing in these regions 10. Studies of metallic photonic crystals have therefore mainly concentrated on microwave and millimetre wavelengths 8, 11, 12. Difficulties in fabricating 3D metallic crystals present another challenge, although emerging techniques such as self-assembly 13, 14 may help to resolve these problems. Here we report measurements and simulations of a 3D tungsten crystal that has a large photonic bandgap at infrared wavelengths (from about 8 to 20 \u00b5m). A very strong attenuation \u2026",

            "We have experimentally and theoretically developed a unique thermally stimulated midinfrared source that emits radiation within a narrow range of wavelengths (\u03b4\u03bb\/\u03bb\u2a7d0.2). The emission wavelengths are defined by the periodicity of a metal coated silicon\u2013air photonic crystal etched into the emitter surface. The lattice of the holes in the metal mediate the coupling of light into discrete surface plasmon states. This yields surfaces with spectrally nonuniform infrared reflection properties where over much of the IR 90+% of photons are reflected yet, in a narrow spectral region, 90% absorption is observed. Transfer matrix calculations simulate well the position and strength of the absorption features. This technology will afford tunable infrared emitters with high power in a narrow spectral band that are critical for sensing, spectroscopy, and thermophotovoltaic applications.",

            "A transferable tight-binding model for silicon is found by fitting the energies of silicon in various bulk crystal structures and examining functional parametrizations of the tight-binding forms. The model has short-range radial forms similar to the tight-binding Hamiltonian of Goodwin, Skinner, and Pettifor but can be utilized in molecular dynamics with a fixed radial cutoff for all structural configurations. In addition to a very good fit to the energy of Si in different bulk crystal structures the model describes very well the elastic constants, defect-formation energies for vacancies and interstitials in crystalline silicon, the melting of Si, and short-range order in liquid silicon. Results for phonon frequencies and Gr\u00fcneisen constants in c-Si are also presented.",
