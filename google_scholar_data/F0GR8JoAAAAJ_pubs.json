            "The combined use of natural ECM components and synthetic materials offers an attractive alternative to fabricate hydrogel-based tissue engineering scaffolds to study cell-matrix interactions in three-dimensions (3D). A facile method was developed to modify gelatin with cysteine via a bifunctional PEG linker, thus introducing free thiol groups to gelatin chains. A covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogel was fabricated using thiolated gelatin and poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGdA) via thiol-ene reaction. Unmodified gelatin was physically incorporated in a PEGdA-only matrix for comparison. We sought to understand the effect of crosslinking modality on hydrogel physicochemical properties and the impact on 3D cell entrapment. Compared to physically incorporated gelatin hydrogels, covalently crosslinked gelatin hydrogels displayed higher maximum weight swelling ratio (Q max), higher water content, significantly \u2026",

We also derive corresponding expressions for the zeroth, second, and fourth harmonics of both the first and second normal stress differences. These harmonics are found to depend upon just two dimensionless groups: the Deborah and Weissenberg numbers, each of which causes non-Newtonian behavior. The form of the solution for the corotational Maxwell model in LAOS matches the forms of the analytical solutions for two molecular models for dilute solutions and one for concentrated solutions or melts. We also derive an analytical solution for the corotational Maxwell model after startup of LAOS. For this we find that both small and large amplitude cases approach a periodic limit cycle \u2026",

In addition, it can be used to measure a broad spectrum of nonlinear viscoelastic properties such as the nonlinear relaxation modulus and the shear stress growth coefficient. In order to measure these nonlinear properties it is necessary to generate large, uniform, transient deformations Involving high strain rates. Rotational and capillary melt rheometers are not capable of generating this type of deformation, and until now it was not convenient to use sliding plate rheometers for this type of application. However, the recent development of a reliable and robust shear stress transducer makes it very convenient \u2026",

Many different hardness scales and indentor geometries have been standardized for durometry. Indentation into a solid is governed by linear elastic mechanics, and this paper relates the Young\u2019s modulus to standardized hardness scale reading. We nondimensionalized these indentation mechanics, to uncover a normalized Young\u2019s modulus, \u03a5, and the dimensionless hardness, , and then, a new dimensionless indentor stiffness that we call mechanical indentability, Mi. We use Mi for classifying standardized hardness scales. Our results allow practitioners to determine the Young\u2019s modulus from measured hardness. Further, our results can be used to convert between hardness scales, not only between hardness scales of the same indentor geometry, but also between those of differing geometry.",

To concisely describe the response of a material to such a test, it is desirable to make use of a constitutive equation. In this way, the response can be described in terms of the parameters of the rheological model. We have found a separable BKZ model, e.g., Wagner\u2019s equation, to be useful in this regard for LDPE IUPAC X. The damping function determined in step shear experiments does not lead to accurate predictions of the LAOS response. For a given low frequency, however, it is possible to fit the parameters of a simple damping function equation to the LAOS response at one strain amplitude and to use these parameter values to reliably predict the response at other strain amplitudes. Thus, the Wagner equation provides a basis for the concise description of the response of LDPE IUPAC X to \u2026",

            "The revised Berkeley kinetic network model is shown to accurately describe experimental data in many types of nonlinear deformation, including large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), exponential shear, planar extension, step biaxial extension, uniaxial extension, and step strain, for the IUPAC X low density polyethylene (LDPE). It is shown that while LAOS is helpful in determining the approximate model parameters, a LAOS test is not sufficient to determine their precise values. Exponential shear, however, is more sensitive to the parameter values, and LAOS and exponential shear together are sufficient for precise parameter determination. Both of these experiments can be performed easily on a sliding plate rheometer incorporating a shear stress transducer.",
