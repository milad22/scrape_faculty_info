We propose that this apparent nonuniversality can actually be understood by considering the predictions of spin fluctuation theory and accounting for the peculiar electronic structure of these systems, coupled with the likely'sign-changing s-wave'(s\u00b1) symmetry. We review theoretical aspects, materials properties and experimental evidence relevant to this suggestion, and discuss which further measurements would be useful to settle these issues.",

            "Weak-coupling approaches to the pairing problem in the iron pnictide superconductors have predicted a wide variety of superconducting ground states. We argue here that this is due both to the inadequacy of certain approximations to the effective low-energy band structure, and to the natural near degeneracy of different pairing channels in superconductors with many distinct Fermi surface sheets. In particular, we review attempts to construct two-orbital effective band models, the argument for their fundamental inconsistency with the symmetry of these materials, and compare the dynamical susceptibilities of two-and five-orbital tight-binding models. We then present results for the magnetic properties, pairing interactions and pairing instabilities within a five-orbital tight-binding random phase approximation model. We discuss the robustness of these results for different dopings, interaction strengths and variations in \u2026",

A nonmagnetic impurity, for instance, is seen to induce magnetism nearby. Even without disorder, models of such correlated systems are generally not soluble in two or three dimensions, and so few exact results are known for the properties of such impurities. Nevertheless, some simple physical ideas have emerged from experiments and approximate theories. Here the authors review what we can learn about this problem from one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetically correlated systems. Experiments on the high-T c cuprate normal state which probe the effect of impurities on local charge and spin degrees of freedom are discussed, and compared with theories of single impurities in correlated hosts, as well as phenomenological effective Kondo \u2026",

Model states considered include the axial and polar states familiar from superfluid He 3 as well as two states, termed hexial and hybrid, occurring in the group-theoretical classification of singlet states in hexagonal symmetry. We calculate the density of states, the critical temperature and the order parameter, the specific heat, the thermal conductivity, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate.

The results for the polar state with impurity concentrations n i\u2245 10\u2212 4 and phase shifts \u0394 o close to the unitarity limit \u03c0 2 appear to give a good description of data on UPt 3.
