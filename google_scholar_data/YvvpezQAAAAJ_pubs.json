The fluorophore positions obtained from a series of imaging cycles were used to reconstruct the overall image. We demonstrated an imaging resolution of 20 nm.

Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.",

Simultaneous electrical and optical measurements using fluorescently labeled influenza A were used to demonstrate conclusively that the conductance changes correspond to binding\/unbinding of single viruses at the surface of nanowire devices. pH-dependent studies further show that the detection mechanism is caused by a field effect, and that the nanowire devices can be used to determine rapidly isoelectric points and variations in receptor-virus binding kinetics for different conditions.

Combinatorial pairing of reporters and activators allows the creation of probes with many distinct colors.

Nevertheless, these approaches are always suffering from the generalizability problem. This paper proposes a novel non-statistics based face representation approach, local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence (LGBPHS), in which training procedure is unnecessary to construct the face model, so that the generalizability problem is naturally avoided. In this approach, a face image is modeled as a \"histogram sequence\" by concatenating the histograms of all the local regions of all the local Gabor magnitude binary pattern maps. For recognition, histogram intersection is used to measure the similarity of different LGBPHSs and the nearest neighborhood is exploited for final classification.

Although many probes have been reported, a systematic characterization of the properties of these probes and their impact on super-resolution image quality has been described in only a few cases.
