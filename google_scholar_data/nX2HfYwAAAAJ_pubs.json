In a previous article we explored \u2018bias\u2019 across research designs and outlined strategies to minimise bias. 1 The aim of this article is to further outline rigour, or the integrity in which a study is conducted, and ensure the credibility of findings in relation to qualitative research. Concepts such as reliability, validity and generalisability typically associated with quantitative research and alternative terminology will be compared in relation to their application to qualitative research. In addition, some of the strategies adopted by qualitative researchers to enhance the credibility of their research are outlined.",

The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb\u2212 1 of pp collision data collected at the LHCb experiment. The complete angular information from the decay is used to determine CP-averaged observables and CP asymmetries, taking account of possible contamination from decays with the K+ \u03c0\u2212 system in an S-wave configuration. The angular observables and their correlations are reported in bins of q 2, the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system. The observables are determined both from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit and by using the principal moments of the angular distribution. In addition, by fitting for q 2-dependent decay amplitudes in the region 1.1< q 2< 6.0 GeV 2\/c 4, the zero-crossing points of several angular observables are computed.

The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The results of statistically independent searches for Higgs bosons produced in conjunction with a top quark-antiquark pair and decaying to pairs of W bosons, Z bosons, photons,  leptons, or bottom quark jets are combined to maximize sensitivity. An excess of events is observed, with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations, over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis. The corresponding expected significance from the standard model for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV is 4.2 standard deviations. The combined best fit signal strength normalized to the standard model prediction is 1.26.",

            "Nodal, a member of the TGF-\u03b2 family of signaling molecules, has been implicated in pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) [Vallier, L., Reynolds, D., Pedersen, R.A., 2004a. Nodal inhibits differentiation of human embryonic stem cells along the neuroectodermal default pathway. Dev. Biol. 275, 403\u2013421], a finding that seems paradoxical given Nodal's central role in mesoderm\/endoderm specification during gastrulation. In this study, we sought to clarify the role of Nodal signaling during hESC differentiation by constitutive overexpression of the endogenous Nodal inhibitors Lefty2 (Lefty) and truncated Cerberus (Cerb-S) and by pharmacological interference using the Nodal receptor antagonist SB431542. Compared to wildtype (WT) controls, embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from either Lefty or Cerb-S overexpressing hESCs showed increased expression of neuroectoderm markers Sox1, Sox3, and \u2026",

            "The resonant substructures of B 0\u2192 D 0 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 decays are studied with the Dalitz plot technique. In this study a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb\u2212 1 of p p collisions collected by the LHCb detector is used. The branching fraction of the B 0\u2192 D 0 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 decay in the region m (D 0 \u03c0\u00b1)> 2.1 GeV\/c 2 is measured to be (8.46\u00b10.14\u00b10.29\u00b10.40)\u00d7 10\u2212 4, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic and the last arises from the normalization channel B 0\u2192 D*(2010)\u2212 \u03c0+. The \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 S-wave components are modeled with the isobar and K-matrix formalisms. Results of the Dalitz plot analyses using both models are presented. A resonant structure at m (D 0 \u03c0\u2212)\u2248 2.8 GeV\/c 2 is confirmed and its spin-parity is determined for the first time as J P= 3\u2212. The branching fraction, mass and width of this structure are determined together with those of the D 0*(2400)\u2212 and D 2*(2460 \u2026",
