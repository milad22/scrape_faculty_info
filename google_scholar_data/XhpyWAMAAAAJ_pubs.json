These include, inter alia, the intensity of trade with other potential members of the currency union, and the extent to which domestic business cycles are correlated with those of the other countries. But international trade patterns and international business cycle correlations are endogenous. This paper develops and investigates the relationship between the two phenomena. Using thirty years of data for twenty industrialised countries, we uncover a strong and striking empirical finding: countries with closer trade links tend to have more tightly correlated business cycles.",

            "Currency unions Their dramatic effect on international tradeA gravity model is used to assess the separate effects of exchange rate volatility and currency unions on international trade. The panel data, bilateral observations for five years during 1970\u201390 covering 186 countries, includes 300+ observations in which both countries use the same currency. I find a large positive effect of a currency union on international trade, and a small negative effect of exchange rate volatility, even after controlling for a host of features, including the endogenous nature of the exchange rate regime. These effects, statistically significant, imply that two countries sharing the same currency trade three times as much as they would with different currencies. Currency unions like the European EMU may thus lead to a large increase in international trade, with all that that entails.\u2014 Andrew Rose",

We examine the composition of the debt as well as its level, and a variety of other macroeconomic factors, external and foreign. Crashes tend to occur when: output growth is low; the growth of domestic credit is high; and the level of foreign interest rates are high. A low ratio of FDI to debt is consistently associated with a high likelihood of a crash.",

Using data from 1959 through 1993 for twenty OECD countries, we consider the antecedents and aftermath of devaluations and revaluations, flotations, fixings and speculative attacks (which may not be successful). We find that realignments of fixed exchange rates are alike: devaluations are preceded by political instability, budget and current account deficits, and fast growth of money and prices. Revaluations are mirror images of devaluations. Speculative attacks resemble devaluations, but money growth and inflation are more endemic and there is no last-minute attempt to tighten monetary policy. In contrast, few consistent correlations link              regime transitions              like flotations or fixings to \u2026",

            "Currency crises tend to be regional; they affect countries in geographic proximity. This suggests that patterns of international trade are important in understanding how currency crises spread, above and beyond any macroeconomic phenomena. We provide empirical support for this hypothesis. Using data for five different currency crises (in 1971, 1973, 1992, 1994 and 1997) we show that currency crises affect clusters of countries tied together by international trade. By way of contrast, macroeconomic and financial influences are not closely associated with the cross-country incidence of speculative attacks.",

The problem was not new empirical evidence against Keynesian theories, but weakness in the theories themselves.'According to the Keynesian view, fluctuations in output arise largely from fluctuations in nominal aggregate demand. These changes in demand have real effects because nominal wages and prices are rigid. But in Keynesian models of the 1970s, the crucial nominal rigidities were assumed rather than",
