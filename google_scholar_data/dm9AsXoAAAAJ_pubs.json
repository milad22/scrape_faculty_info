Microscopic analyses of stem sections from 2-year-old plants revealed substantial morphological changes in both wood and bark tissues. This included the formation of weakly lignified tracheids that displayed signs of collapse and the development of circumferential bands of axial parenchyma. Acetyl bromide-soluble lignin assays and proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed lignin reductions of 36% to 50% in the most severely affected transgenic plants. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry studies indicated that lignin reductions were mainly due to depletion of guaiacyl but not p-hydroxyphenyl lignin. 4CL silencing also \u2026",

The cambium, xylem and phloem were investigated by means of light- and transmission electron microscopy and UV-microspectrophotometry in tissues sampled from living trees.\u2022 Key Results Localized heating for 10 d initiated cambial divisions on the phloem side and after 20 d also on the xylem side. In a control tree, regular cambial activity started after 30 d. In the heat-treated sample, up to 15 earlywood cells undergoing differentiation were found to be present. The response of the cambium to stem cooling was less pronounced, and no anatomical \u2026",

Reputable timber traders are also struggling to police their own supply chains and comply with the growing requirement for due diligence with respect to timber origins and legality. A range of scientific methods have been developed independently with the potential to provide the required identification information, but little attention has been given to how these tools can be applied synergistically to support the legal timber trade.

Determination of the topochemical distribution of lignin and aromatics in sugar cane might provide important data on the recalcitrance of specific cells. We used cellular ultraviolet (UV) microspectrophotometry (UMSP) to topochemically detect lignin and hydroxycinnamic acids in individual fiber, vessel and parenchyma cell walls of untreated and chlorite-treated sugar cane. Internodes, presenting typical vascular bundles and sucrose-storing parenchyma cells, were divided into rind and pith fractions. Vascular bundles were more abundant in the rind, whereas parenchyma cells predominated in the pith region. UV measurements of untreated fiber cell walls gave absorbance spectra typical of grass lignin, with a band at 278 nm and a pronounced shoulder at 315 nm, assigned to the presence of hydroxycinnamic acids linked \u2026",

For the chemical characterisation of accessory compounds, acetone and methanol extracts of the discoloured beechwood were separated by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and analysed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The UV microscopic investigations reveal that the accessory compounds responsible for the discolouration of beechwood are mainly restricted to the longitudinal and ray parenchyma cells and the lumen of vessels. The detected extractives are characterised by high UV absorbance values and an absorbance maximum in a wavelength range between 280 and 290 nm.

Their stems represent a system of stiff fibrous elements embedded in the soft parenchymatous tissue. The proper design of the interface of the stiffening elements and the parenchyma is crucial for the functioning of the stem. The strategy of the palm to compromise between stiff fibre caps and the soft parenchymatous tissue may serve as a model system for avoiding stress discontinuities in inhomogeneous and anisotropic fibre-reinforced composite materials. We investigated the mechanical, structural and biochemical properties of the fibre caps of the palm Washingtonia robusta at different levels of hierarchy with high spatial resolution.

Heartwood extractives (methanol and acetone extraction) were analysed by HPLC-chromatography. UV microspectrophotometry was used to topochemically localise the extractives in the cell walls. The natural durability of the juvenile and mature heartwood was analysed according to the European standard EN 350-1.

            "Topochemical detection of lignin and phenolic compounds was carried out at subcellular level in tension wood fibres of maple (Acer spp.), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus robur) by means of cellular UV-microspectrophotometry (UMSP) and confocal Raman microscopy. UMSP field scans at 278 nm revealed the presence of aromatic compounds in the gelatinous layer (G-layer) in tension wood of all three species. Characterisation of the detected substances by point measurements from 240 nm to 400 nm revealed a plausible relationship to by-products from the lignin biosynthesis pathway. Raman spectra, recorded from different regions within the G-layer, showed a high affinity to spectra of lignins. The degree of aromatic compounds in the G-layer of oak tension wood fibres was approximately three-fold higher than that in maple and beech. Moreover, the oak G-layer showed an accumulation of aromatic \u2026",
