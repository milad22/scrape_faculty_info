            "Research in semiconductor spintronics aims to extend the scope of conventional electronics by using the spin degree of freedom of an electron in addition to its charge 1. Significant scientific advances in this area have been reported, such as the development of diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors 2, 3, spin injection into semiconductors from ferromagnetic metals 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and discoveries of new physical phenomena involving electron spin 9, 10. Yet no viable means of developing spintronics in semiconductors has been presented. Here we report a theoretical design that is a conceptual step forward\u2014spin accumulation is used as the basis of a semiconductor computer circuit. Although the giant magnetoresistance effect in metals 11, 12 has already been commercially exploited, it does not extend to semiconductor\/ferromagnet systems, because the effect is too weak for logic operations.

We expand on spin flips induced by flexural phonons and show that the spin relaxation is ultrafast for electrons in free-standing membranes while being mitigated in supported membranes. This behavior due to interaction with flexural phonons is universal in two-dimensional membranes that respect mirror symmetry, and it leads to a counterintuitive inverse relation between mobility and spin relaxation.",

Here, we demonstrate a luminescence upconversion process from a negatively charged exciton to a neutral exciton resonance in monolayer WSe 2, producing spontaneous anti-Stokes emission with an energy gain of 30 meV.

Here we demonstrate an approach that differs from previous proposals such as the Datta and Das modulator, and that is based on a van de Waals heterostructure of atomically thin graphene and semiconducting MoS 2. Our device combines the superior spin transport properties of graphene with the strong spin\u2013orbit coupling of MoS 2 and allows switching of the spin current in the graphene channel between ON and OFF states by tuning the spin absorption into the MoS 2 with a gate electrode. Our proposal holds potential for technologically relevant applications such as search engines or pattern recognition circuits, and opens possibilities towards electrical injection of spins into transition metal dichalcogenides and alike materials.",

To explain optical properties of a given monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide, one should consider (i) the order of its spin-split conduction bands,(ii) whether intervalley scattering is prone to phonon bottleneck,(iii) and whether valley mixing by electron-hole exchange can take place. Using these principles, we present a consistent physical picture that elucidates a variety of features in the optical spectra of these materials.
