            "This paper describes an experimentally simple system for measuring rates of electron transport across organic thin films having a range of molecular structures. The system uses a metal\u2212insulator\u2212metal junction based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs); it is particularly easy to assemble. The junction consists of a SAM supported on a silver film (Ag-SAM(1)) in contact with a second SAM supported on the surface of a drop of mercury (Hg-SAM(2))that is, a Ag-SAM(1)SAM(2)-Hg junction. SAM(1) and SAM(2) can be derived from the same or different thiols. The current that flowed across junctions with SAMs of aliphatic thiols or aromatic thiols on Ag and a SAM of hexadecane thiol on Hg depended both on the molecular structure and on the thickness of the SAM on Ag:\u2009 the current density at a bias of 0.5 V ranged from 2 \u00d7 10-10 A\/cm2 for HS(CH2)15CH3 on Ag to 1 \u00d7 10-6 A\/cm2 for HS(CH2)7CH3 on Ag, and from \u2026",

Electromagnetic fields may be chiral, too, with circularly polarized light (CPL) as the paradigmatic example. A recently introduced measure of the local degree of chiral dissymmetry in electromagnetic fields suggested the existence of optical modes more selective than circularly polarized plane waves in preferentially exciting single enantiomers in certain regions of space. By probing induced fluorescence intensity, we demonstrated experimentally an 11-fold enhancement over CPL in discrimination of the enantiomers of a biperylene derivative by precisely sculpted electromagnetic fields. This result, which agrees to within 15% with theoretical predictions, establishes that optical chirality is a fundamental and tunable property of light, with possible applications ranging from plasmonic sensors to absolute asymmetric \u2026",

Here we achieved this goal by using the endogenous fluorescence of a microbial rhodopsin protein, Archaerhodopsin 3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense, expressed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. This genetically encoded voltage indicator exhibited an approximately tenfold improvement in sensitivity and speed over existing protein-based voltage indicators, with a roughly linear twofold increase in brightness between\u2212 150 mV and+ 150 mV and a sub-millisecond response time. Arch detected single electrically triggered action potentials with an optical signal-to-noise ratio> 10.

However, it has not been possible to probe voltage dynamics in an intact bacterium. Here we developed a method to reveal electrical spiking in Escherichia coli. To probe bacterial membrane potential, we engineered a voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein based on green-absorbing proteorhodopsin. Expression of the proteorhodopsin optical proton sensor (PROPS) in E. coli revealed electrical spiking at up to 1 hertz. Spiking was sensitive to chemical and physical perturbations and coincided with rapid efflux of a small-molecule fluorophore, suggesting that bacterial efflux machinery may be electrically regulated.",
