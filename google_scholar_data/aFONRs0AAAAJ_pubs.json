            "Quorum sensing is a chemical communication process that bacteria use to regulate collective behaviors. Disabling quorum-sensing circuits with small molecules has been proposed as a potential strategy to prevent bacterial pathogenicity. The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing to control virulence and biofilm formation. Here, we analyze synthetic molecules for inhibition of the two P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing receptors, LasR and RhlR. Our most effective compound, meta-bromo-thiolactone (mBTL), inhibits both the production of the virulence factor pyocyanin and biofilm formation. mBTL also protects Caenorhabditis elegans and human lung epithelial cells from killing by P. aeruginosa. Both LasR and RhlR are partially inhibited by mBTL in vivo and in vitro; however, RhlR, not LasR, is the relevant in vivo target. More potent antagonists do not exhibit superior function in impeding \u2026",

            "Two-component signal transduction systems are the predominant means by which bacteria sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Bacteria often employ tens or hundreds of these paralogous signaling systems, comprised of histidine kinases (HKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs). Faithful transmission of information through these signaling pathways and avoidance of detrimental crosstalk demand exquisite specificity of HK-RR interactions. To identify the determinants of two-component signaling specificity, we examined patterns of amino acid coevolution in large, multiple sequence alignments of cognate kinase-regulator pairs. Guided by these results, we demonstrate that a subset of the coevolving residues is sufficient, when mutated, to completely switch the substrate specificity of the kinase EnvZ. Our results shed light on the basis of molecular discrimination in two-component signaling \u2026",

The high level of sequence similarity between some systems raises the possibility of undesired cross\u2010talk between a histidine kinase and a non\u2010cognate response regulator. Although molecular specificity ensures that phospho\u2010transfer occurs primarily between correct partners, even a low level of inappropriate cross\u2010talk could lead to unacceptable levels of noise or interference in signal transduction. To explore mechanisms that provide insulation against such interference, we have examined cross\u2010talk between the histidine kinase CpxA and non\u2010cognate response regulator OmpR in Escherichia coli. Our results show that there are two mechanisms that suppress cross\u2010talk between these two proteins, which depend on the corresponding cognate partners CpxR and EnvZ \u2026",

Previous studies of virulence regulation have largely focused on chemical cues, but P. aeruginosa may also respond to mechanical cues. Using a rapid imaging-based virulence assay, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa activates virulence in response to attachment to a range of chemically distinct surfaces, suggesting that this bacterial species responds to mechanical properties of its substrates. Surface-activated virulence requires quorum sensing, but activating quorum sensing does not induce virulence without surface attachment. The activation of virulence by surfaces also requires the surface-exposed protein PilY1, which has a domain homologous to a eukaryotic mechanosensor. Specific mutation of the putative PilY1 mechanosensory domain is sufficient to induce virulence in non\u2013surface \u2026",

The motility of bacteria on surfaces in the presence of flow has not been well characterized. Here we focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen that thrives in flow conditions such as in catheters and respiratory tracts. We investigate the effects of flow on P. aeruginosa cells and describe a mechanism in which surface shear stress orients surface-attached P. aeruginosa cells along the flow direction, causing cells to migrate against the flow direction while pivoting in a zig-zag motion. This upstream movement is due to the retraction of type IV pili by the ATPase motors PilT and PilU and results from the effects of flow on the polar localization of type IV pili. This directed upstream motility could be beneficial in environments \u2026",
