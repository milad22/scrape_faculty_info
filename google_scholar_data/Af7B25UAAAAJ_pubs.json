            "We suggest a means of obtaining certain Green's functions in 3+ 1-dimensional N= 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a large number of colors via non-critical string theory. The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level n acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as 2 ng YM 2N 1\/2 \u2026",

Far in the IR the gauge theory confines; its chiral symmetry breaking removes the singularity of [hep-th\/0002159] by deforming the conifold. We propose a non-singular pure-supergravity background dual to the field theory on all scales, with small curvature everywhere if thet Hooft coupling g s M is large. In the UV it approaches that of [hep-th\/0002159], incorporating the logarithmic flow of couplings. In the IR the deformation of the conifold gives a geometrical realization of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. We suggest that pure Script N= 1 Yang-Mills may be dual to strings propagating at small g s M \u2026",

In such vacua, operators built out of the scalar fields acquire expectation values, and we show how to calculate them from the behavior of perturbations to the AdS background near the boundary. Specific examples include the N = 4 SYM theory, and theories on D3-branes placed on orbifolds and conifolds. We also clarify some subtleties of the AdS\/CFT correspondence that arise in this analysis. In particular, we explain how scalar fields in AdS space of sufficiently negative mass-squared can be associated with CFT operators of two possible dimensions. All dimensions are bounded from below by (d\u22122)\/2; this is the unitarity bound for scalar operators in d-dimensional field theory.

            "The free energy of the maximally supersymmetric SU (N) gauge theory at temperature T is expected to scale, in the large-N limit, as N 2 T 4 times a function of the't Hooft coupling, f (g YM 2 N). In the strong coupling limit the free energy has been deduced from the near-extremal 3-brane geometry, and its normalization has turned out to be 3 4 times that found in the weak coupling limit. In this paper we calculate the leading correction to this result in inverse powers of the coupling, which originates from the R 4 terms in the tree-level effective action of type IIB string theory. The correction to 3 4 is positive and of order (g YM 2 N)\u2212 3 2. Thus, f (g YM 2 N) increases as the't Hooft coupling is decreased, in accordance with the expectation that is should be approaching 1 in the weak coupling limit. We also discuss similar corrections for other conformal theories describing coincident branes. In particular, we suggest that the \u2026",

In particular, we prove the full SU (4) R-symmetry of the ABJM theory. We then consider orbifold projections of this theory that give non-chiral and chiral (U (N)\u00d7 U (N)) n superconformal quiver gauge theories. We argue that these theories are dual to certain AdS 4\u00d7 S 7\/(Bbb Z n\u00d7 Bbb Z tilde k) backgrounds of M-theory. We also study a SU (3) invariant mass term in the superpotential that makes the Script N= 8 theory flow to a Script N= 2 superconformal gauge theory with a sextic superpotential. We conjecture that this gauge theory is dual to the U (1) R\u00d7 SU (3) invariant extremum of the Script N= 8 gauged supergravity, which was discovered by N. Warner 25 years ago and whose \u2026",
