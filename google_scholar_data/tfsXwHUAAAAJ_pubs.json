            "Stimulation of \u03b2 2-adrenergic receptors on the cell surface by adrenaline or noradrenaline leads to alterations in the metabolism, excitability, differentiation and growth of many cell types. These effects have traditionally been thought to be mediated exclusively by receptor activation of intracellular G proteins 1. However, certain physiological effects of \u03b2 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation, notably the regulation of cellular pH by modulation of Na+\/H+ exchanger (NHE) function, do not seem to be entirely dependent on G-protein activation 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We report here a direct agonist-promoted association of the \u03b2 2-adrenergic receptor with the Na+\/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF), a protein that regulates the activity of the Na+\/H+ exchanger type 3 (NHE3) 8. NHERF binds to the \u03b2 2-adrenergic receptor by means of a PDZ-domain-mediated interaction with the last few residues of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic \u2026",

By screening in vitro translated cDNA pools for the ability to bind 14-3-3, we identified a novel transcriptional co-activator, TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) as a 14-3-3-binding molecule. TAZ shares homology with Yes-associated protein (YAP), contains a WW domain and functions as a transcriptional co-activator by binding to the PPXY motif present on transcription factors. 14-3-3 binding requires TAZ phosphorylation on a single serine residue, resulting in the inhibition of TAZ transcriptional co-activation through 14-3-3-mediated nuclear export. The C-terminus of TAZ contains a highly conserved PDZ-binding motif that localizes TAZ into discrete nuclear foci and is essential for TAZ-stimulated \u2026",

The signalling and trafficking properties of GPCRs are often highly malleable depending on the cellular context. Such fine-tuning of GPCR function can be attributed in many cases to receptor-interacting proteins that are differentially expressed in distinct cell types. In some cases these GPCR-interacting partners directly mediate receptor signalling, whereas in other cases they act mainly as scaffolds to modulate G protein-mediated signalling. Furthermore, GPCR-interacting proteins can have a big impact on the regulation of GPCR trafficking, localization and\/or pharmacological properties.",

NHERF contains two PDZ domains, the first of which is required for its interaction with the \u03b22 receptor. Mutagenesis studies of the \u03b22 receptor tail revealed that the optimal C-terminal motif for binding to the first PDZ domain of NHERF is D-S\/T-x-L, a motif distinct from those recognized by other PDZ domains. The first PDZ domain of NHERF-2, a protein that is 52% identical to NHERF and also known as E3KARP, SIP-1, and TKA-1, exhibits binding preferences very similar to those of the first PDZ domain of NHERF. The delineation of the preferred binding motif for the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins allows for predictions for other proteins that may interact with NHERF or NHERF-2.

GPCRs have traditionally been thought to act as monomers, but recent evidence suggests that GPCRs may form dimers (or higher-order oligomers) as part of their normal trafficking and function. In fact, certain GPCRs seem to have a strict requirement for heterodimerization to attain proper surface expression and functional activity. Even those GPCRs that do not absolutely require heterodimerization may still specifically associate with other GPCR subtypes, sometimes resulting in dramatic effects on receptor pharmacology, signaling, and\/or internalization. Understanding the specificity and functional significance of GPCR heterodimerization is of tremendous clinical importance since GPCRs are the molecular targets for numerous therapeutic drugs.",

            "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for many cell types. The PDGF receptor (PDGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates the mitogenic effects of PDGF by binding to and\/or phosphorylating a variety of intracellular signaling proteins upon PDGF-induced receptor dimerization. We show here that the Na+\/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF; also known as EBP50), a protein not previously known to interact with the PDGFR, binds to the PDGFR carboxyl terminus (PDGFR-CT) with high affinity via a PDZ (PSD-95\/Dlg\/Z0-1 homology) domain-mediated interaction and potentiates PDGFR autophosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in cells. A point-mutated version of the PDGFR, with the terminal leucine changed to alanine (L1106A), cannot bind NHERF in vitro and is markedly impaired relative to the wild-type receptor with regard to PDGF-induced \u2026",
