            "Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles emitted in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV are presented, using data collected with the CMS detector over a broad range of pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and azimuthal angle (\u03d5). Short-range correlations in \u0394\u03b7, which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a simple \u201cindependent cluster\u201d parametrization in order to quantify their strength (cluster size) and their extent in \u03b7 (cluster decay width). Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980 nb\u2212 1 data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate p T of 1\u20133 GeV\/c, 2.0<| \u0394\u03b7|< 4. 8 and \u0394\u03d5\u2248 0.

Jets are reconstructed using the energy deposited in the CMS calorimeters and studied as a function of collision centrality. With increasing collision centrality, a striking imbalance in dijet transverse momentum is observed, consistent with jet quenching. The observed effect extends from the lower cutoff used in this study (jet p T= 120 GeV\/c) up to the statistical limit of the available data sample (jet p T\u2248 210 GeV\/c). Correlations of charged particle tracks with jets indicate that the momentum imbalance is accompanied by a softening of the fragmentation pattern of the second most energetic, away-side jet. The dijet momentum balance is recovered when integrating low transverse \u2026",

Jets are reconstructed using combined information from tracking and calorimetry, using the anti-k T algorithm with R= 0.3. The dijet momentum balance and angular correlations are studied as a function of collision centrality and leading jet transverse momentum. For the most peripheral PbPb collisions, good agreement of the dijet momentum balance distributions with pp data and reference calculations at the same collision energy is found, while more central collisions show a strong imbalance of leading and subleading jet transverse momenta attributed to the jet-quenching effect. The dijets in central collisions are found to be more unbalanced than the reference, for leading jet transverse momenta \u2026",
