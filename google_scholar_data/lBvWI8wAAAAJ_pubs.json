            "In this work, surfactant-free atomically ultrathin Rh nanosheet nanoassemblies (Rh NNs) are synthesized and used for the first time as an effective electrocatalyst in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient temperature and pressure. The inorganic polymer RhCl3\u2013K3Co(CN)6 cyanogel plays an important role in the generation of ultrathin Rh nanosheets with a clean surface. Due to their unique ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheet structure (ca. 1 nm) with a high specific surface area and modified electronic structure, the surfactant-free Rh NNs demonstrate an excellent catalytic activity for the NRR with a high production yield (NH3: 23.88 \u03bcg h\u22121 mgcat\u22121) and favorable selectivity (no N2H4 generation) at low potential (\u22120.2 V vs. RHE), outperforming most of the current electrocatalysts reported for the NRR. Except the contribution to the efficient NRR electrocatalysis, this synthesis strategy would provide some \u2026",

However, the weak activity of most anode electrocatalysts for the C\uf8ffC bond cleavage is an obstacle to the DEFCs development. Herein, a simple galvanic replacement reaction strategy to synthesize hollow and porous PtRhCu trimetallic nanoboxes (CNBs) with a tunable Pt\/Rh atomic ratio is developed. For the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), PtRhCu CNBs show morphology and composition\u2010dependent electrocatalytic activity. The composition optimized Pt54Rh4Cu42 CNBs exhibit excellent specific and mass activity and stability for the EOR, which is attributed to its unique geometric structure and synergistic effects. The hollow porous structure can effectively enhance the atomic utilization and mass transfer. The introduction of Cu improves the antipoisoning capability for CO.

Strong interactions between the arginine molecules are key in driving the self-assembly of primary nanocrystals. In addition, the strong coordination interactions between arginine and metal ions is responsible for the formation of Pt\u2013Cu alloys.

Hollow and porous NMNSs possess generally prominent advantages over their solid counterparts due to their unordinary structural features. In this work, we describe a facial one-pot synthesis of hollow and porous Pd\u2013Cu alloy nanospheres (Pd\u2013Cu HPANSs) through a polyethylenimine (PEI)-assisted oxidation\u2013dissolution mechanism. The strong coordination interaction between CuII and PEI facilitates the oxidation\u2013dissolution of the Cu2O nanospheres template under air conditions, which is responsible for the generation of the Pd\u2013Cu alloy and the convenient removal of the Cu2O nanospheres template at room temperature.

Recently, Pd-based nanocrystals have attracted attention as Pt-alternative cathode catalysts towards the ORR in the alkaline electrolyte. Unfortunately, the pristine Pd-based nanocrystals lack the selectivity towards the ORR due to their inherent activity for the alcohol molecule oxidation reaction in the alkaline electrolyte. In this work, polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified AuPd alloy nanocrystals with Au-rich AuPd alloy cores and Pd-rich PdAu alloy shells (AuPd@PdAu-PEI) are successfully synthesized using a traditional chemical reduction method in presence of PEI. The rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique is applied to evaluate the ORR performance of AuPd@PdAu-PEI nanocrystals. Compared with commercial Pd \u2026",
