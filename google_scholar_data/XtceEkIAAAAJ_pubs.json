For example, the short message and browsing functions in a cell phone provide users with timely and adaptive information access.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted on a senior high school English course by assigning three classes of students to two experimental groups and a control group.

To construct an asynchronous learning forum on mobile devices is important because an asynchronous learning forum is always an essential part of networked asynchronous distance learning. However, the input interface in handheld learning devices, which is generally handwritten, is not efficient. Hence, most learners do not attempt to use online asynchronous learning forums on a handheld learning device. Although the wireless internet learning device (WILD) can recommend proper online learning partners depending on the level of a learner, the mechanism is similar to a synchronous learning forum, such as a chat room. In other words, learners should be online at the same time to chat with each other.
