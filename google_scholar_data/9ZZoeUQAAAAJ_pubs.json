            "We experimentally demonstrate a supercurrent-assisted, hotspot-formation mechanism for ultrafast detection and counting of visible and infrared photons. A photon-induced hotspot leads to a temporary formation of a resistive barrier across the superconducting sensor strip and results in an easily measurable voltage pulse. Subsequent hotspot healing in \u223c30 ps time frame, restores the superconductivity (zero-voltage state), and the detector is ready to register another photon. Our device consists of an ultrathin, very narrow NbN strip, maintained at 4.2 K and current-biased close to the critical current. It exhibits an experimentally measured quantum efficiency of \u223c20% for 0.81 \u03bcm wavelength photons and negligible dark counts.",

Our SPDs exhibit experimentally determined quantum efficiencies ranging from \u223c0.2% at the 1.55 \u03bcm wavelength to \u223c70% at 0.4 \u03bcm. Spectral dependences of the detection efficiency (DE) at the 0.4 to 3.0-\u03bcm-wavelength range are presented. The exponential character of the DE dependence on wavelength, as well as its dependence versus bias current, is qualitatively explained in terms of superconducting fluctuations in our ultrathin, submicron-width superconducting stripes. The DE values of large-active-area NbN SPDs in the visible range are high enough for modern quantum communications.",

By varying the current\u2013voltage biasing conditions between the superconducting and resistive (hot spot) states, we observed transients that correspond to the nonequilibrium kinetic-inductance and the nonequilibrium electron-heating response mechanisms, respectively. The two-temperature model and the Rothwarf\u2013Taylor theory have been used to simulate the measured wave forms and to extract the temporal parameters. The electron thermalization time and the electron\u2013phonon energy relaxation time were determined by the electron temperature rise and decay times, which were found to be 0.56 and 1.1 ps, respectively, in the resistive state. We have also measured the ratio between the phonon and electron specific heats to be 38 \u2026",

Our devices exhibit quantum efficiency (QE) of up to 30% in near-infrared wavelength and 0.4% at 5 mum, with a dark-count rate that can be as low as 10 -4  s -1 . The SSPD structures integrated with lambda\/4 microcavities achieve a QE of 60% at telecommunication, 1550-nm wavelength. We have also developed a new generation of SSPDs that possess the QE of large-active-area devices, but, simultaneously, are characterized by low kinetic inductance that allows achieving short response times and the GHz-counting rate with picosecond timing jitter. The improvements presented in the SSPD development, such as fiber-coupled SSPDs, make our detectors most attractive for high-speed quantum communications and quantum computing.",

The detection mechanism is based on photon-induced hotspot formation, which forces the supercurrent redistribution and leads to the appearance of a transient resistive barrier across an ultrathin, submicrometer-width, superconducting stripe. The devices were fabricated from 3.5-nm- and 10-nm-thick NbN films, patterned into <200-nm-wide stripes in the 4 \/spl times\/ 4-\/spl mu\/m\/sup 2\/ or 10 \/spl times\/ 10-\/spl mu\/m\/sup 2\/ meander-type geometry, and operated at 4.2 K, well below the NbN critical temperature (T\/sub c\/=10-11 K). Continuous-wave and pulsed-laser optical sources in the 400-nm-to 3500-nm-wavelength range were used to determine the detector performance in the photon-counting mode. Experimental quantum efficiency was found to exponentially depend on the photon wavelength, and for our \u2026",
