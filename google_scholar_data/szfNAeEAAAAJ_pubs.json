Based on astrometric (1995\u20132007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000\u20132007) measurements from the W. M.

If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining   kpc and    . More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3\u2013    within 0.01 pc, \u223c100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models.

Within 0 4 of the Galaxy\u2019s central dark mass, 17 proper\u2010motion stars, with K magnitudes ranging from 14.0 to 16.8, are identified, and 10 of these are new detections (six were also independently discovered by others).

Orbits are derived simultaneously so that they jointly constrain the central dark object\u2019s properties: its mass, its position, and, for the first time using orbits, its motion on the plane of the sky. This analysis pinpoints the Galaxy\u2019s central dark mass to within 1.3 mas (10 AU) and limits its proper motion to   mas yr\u22121 (or equivalently   km s\u22121) with respect to the central stellar cluster.

A number of dissipative processes lead to a strong concentration of gas into a \u201cCentral Molecular Zone\u201d of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular medium is characterized by large densities, large velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and apparently strong magnetic fields.
