It is shown, in the context of a simple model of the Z 2 vortex core, how vortex condensation in Yang-Mills theory can account for both Casimir scaling in intermediate size loops and color-screening in larger loops. An implication of our model is that the deviations from exact Casimir scaling, which tend to grow with loop size, become much more pronounced as the dimensionality of the group representation increases.",

We find that the color-Coulomb potential, associated with the gluon propagator, grows linearly with distance both in the confined and\u2014surprisingly\u2014in the high-temperature deconfined phase of pure Yang-Mills theory. We also find a remnant symmetry-breaking transition in SU (2) gauge-Higgs theory which completely isolates the Higgs region from the (pseudo) confinement region of the phase diagram. This transition exists despite the absence, pointed out long ago by Fradkin and Shenker, of a genuine thermodynamic phase transition separating the two regions.",

            "We estimate the Coulomb energy of static quarks from a Monte Carlo calculation of the correlator of timelike link variables in the Coulomb gauge. We find, in agreement with Cucchieri and Zwanziger, that this energy grows linearly with distance at large quark separations. The corresponding string tension, however, is several times greater than the accepted asymptotic string tension, indicating that a state containing only static sources, with no constituent gluons, is not the lowest energy flux tube state. The Coulomb energy is also measured on thermalized lattices with center vortices removed by the de Forcrand\u2013D\u2019Elia procedure. We find that when vortices are removed, the Coulomb string tension vanishes.",

            "In the hamiltonian formulation of fermions coupled to external gauge fields, the axial anomaly has a simple physical interpretation in terms of level shifting at the top of the Dirac sea. We apply this formalism to lattice QED in 1 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions, in order to study how the lattice regulation and small fermion mass affect the picture. For a simple choice of the E and B fields, it is possible to accurately follow the time evolution of the (lattice) Dirac sea of Wilson fermions. We find that the Wilson r term plays a role, with respect to the anomaly, which is closely analogous to point-splitting in the continuum. This role is jeopardized whenever the Wilson mass scale r\/a is comparable to other physical mass scales in the problem, as is the case, for example, in strong coupling calculations. Remarkably, we find that hadronic scales of only a few lattice spacings are probably sufficient to guarantee the proper anomaly structure.",
