Thermal analysis and magnetodynamics studies revealed many interesting aspects of the amorphous iron oxide nanoparticles. The as-prepared sample was amorphous. Crystallization of the maghemite \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (with an activation energy of 0.71 eV) and the hematite \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (with an activation energy of 0.97 eV) phase occurred at around 300 C and 350 C, respectively. A transition from the maghemite to the hematite occurred at 500 C with an activation energy of 1.32 eV. A study of the temperature dependence of magnetization supported the crystallization and the phase transformation. Raman shift at 660 cm\u2212 1 and absorption band in the infrared spectra at 690 cm\u2212 1 showed the presence of disorder in the hematite phase on the \u2026",

The analysis of the XRD data using the Win-metric software shows an increase in the unit cell volume with increasing Sr ion concentration. The La0.7SrxCa0.3\u2212xMnO3 compounds undergo a structural orthorhombic-to-monoclinic transition at x=0.15.
