            "A new formulation of the mixed-valence problem is presented in which the singlet valence state of a rare-earth ion is represented by a zero-energy boson and the spinning state by a spin-j fermion. This representation avoids the need to use Hubbard operators with awkward algebras and avails itself of standard techniques for dealing with interacting quantum systems. In particular, a Feynman-diagram expansion for the thermodynamic variables and spectral functions can be developed. The advantages of the approach are illustrated for the mixed-valence impurity problem. Vertex corrections are found to be O (1 N 2), where N is the degeneracy of the rare-earth ion, allowing a self-consistent calculation of the f-electron spectral function to order O (1 N 2) that is valid in both the mixed-valence and Kondo regimes. The extension to the lattice is outlined and some preliminary results reported.",

The quantum fluctuations between order and disorder 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 that develop at this point induce profound transformations in the finite temperature electronic properties of the material. Magnetic fields are ideal for tuning a material as close as possible to a QCP, where the most intense effects of criticality can be studied. A previous study 6 on the heavy-electron material YbRh 2 Si 2 found that near a field-induced QCP electrons move ever more slowly and scatter off one another with ever increasing probability, as indicated by a divergence to infinity of the electron effective mass and scattering cross-section. But these studies could not shed light on whether these properties were an artefact of the applied field 7, 8, or a more general feature of field-free QCPs.

            "A modern, graduate-level introduction to many-body physics in condensed matter, this textbook explains the tools and concepts needed for a research-level understanding of the correlated behavior of quantum fluids. Starting with an operator-based introduction to the quantum field theory of many-body physics, this textbook presents the Feynman diagram approach, Green's functions and finite-temperature many body physics before developing the path integral approach to interacting systems. Special chapters are devoted to the concepts of Fermi liquid theory, broken symmetry, conduction in disordered systems, superconductivity and the physics of local-moment metals. A strong emphasis on concepts and numerous exercises make this an invaluable course book for graduate students in condensed matter physics. It will also interest students in nuclear, atomic and particle physics.",

            "By using a generalized version of the infinite-U Anderson model, strong-coupling properties of mixed-valence systems are modeled by means of an expansion about a broken-symmetry mean-field theory. A renormalized Fermi liquid, with heavy-fermion bands in the lattice is an intrinsic feature of this mean-field theory. Strong-coupling divergence of the Kondo coupling constant arises as a direct consequence of the zero-mode fluctuations about the broken-symmetry state. In the large-degeneracy limit these fluctuations vanish and the broken-symmetry state is an exact solution, explicitly confirmed for the single-impurity case by a new Bethe-ansatz solution. The crossover to strong coupling is a vestige of the phase transition into the broken-symmetry state. Landau parameters, charge and spin correlations of the heavy Fermi liquid are directly related to the fluctuations about the broken-symmetry state. The general \u2026",
