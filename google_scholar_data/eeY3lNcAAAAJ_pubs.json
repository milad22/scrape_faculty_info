For a good fraction of them an estimate of the jet opening angle is available from the achromatic break of their afterglow light curve. This allows the derivation of the collimation\u2010corrected energy of the bursts, E\u03b3. The distribution of the values of E\u03b3 is more spread out than in previous findings, covering about 2 orders of magnitude. We find a surprisingly tight correlation between E\u03b3 and the source frame Epeak:  . This correlation can shed light on the still uncertain radiation processes for the prompt GRB emission. More importantly, if the small scatter of this newly found correlation could be confirmed by forthcoming data, it would be possible to use it for cosmological purposes.",

            "Gamma-ray bursts are often modelled as jet-like outflows directed towards the observer; the cone angle of the jet is then commonly inferred from the time at which there is a steepening in the power-law decay of the afterglow. We consider an alternative model in which the jet has a beam pattern where the luminosity per unit solid angle (and perhaps also the initial Lorentz factor) decreases smoothly away from the axis, rather than having a well-defined cone angle within which the flow is uniform. We show that the break in the afterglow light curve then occurs at a time that depends on the viewing angle. Instead of implying a range of intrinsically different jets \u2013 some very narrow, and others with a similar power spread over a wider cone \u2013 the data on afterglow breaks could be consistent with a standardized jet, viewed from different angles. We discuss the implication of this model for the luminosity function.",

After a critical review of the literature values of the total cosmic X\u2010ray background (CXB) we conclude that, with the present data,   and   of the soft and hard CXB can be ascribed to discrete source emission.

Faster but later shells can then catch up slower earlier ones. In the resulting collisions shocks develop, converting some of the ordered bulk kinetic energy into magnetic field and random energy of the electrons which then radiate. We propose that this internal shock scenario, which is the scenario generally thought to explain the observed gamma-ray burst radiation, can also work for radio sources in general, and for blazars in particular. We investigate in detail this idea, simulating the birth, propagation and collision of shells, calculating the spectrum produced in each collision, and summing the locally produced spectra from those regions of the jet which are simultaneously active in the observer's frame. We can thus construct snapshots of the overall \u2026",

These rates are several orders of magnitude lower than the rate of core\u2010collapse supernovae, suggesting that the evolution leading to an HN\/GRB requires special circumstances, very likely due to binary interactions.
