            "In many materials with a highly anisotropic band structure, electron-phonon interactions lead to a novel type of ground state called the charge-density wave. The condensate is pinned to the underlying lattice by impurities and by boundary effects, but can, even for small electric fields, carry current in a fashion originally envisioned by Fr\u00f6hlich. This review discusses some of the underlying theories and the main experimental observations on this new collective transport phenomenon. The frequency-and electric-field-dependent conductivity, current oscillations, electric-field-dependent transport coefficients and elastic properties, together with nuclear-magnetic-resonance experiments, provide clear evidence for a translational motion of the condensate. Various theories, involving classical and quantum-mechanical concepts, are able to account for a broad variety of experimental findings, which were also made in the \u2026",

            "? Density Waves in Solids is written for graduate students and scientists interested in solid-state sciences. It discusses the theoretical and experimental state of affairs of two novel types of broken symmetry ground states of metals, charge, and spin density waves. These states arise as the consequence of electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in low-dimensional metals. Some fundamental aspects of the one-dimensional electron gas, and of the materials with anisotropic properties, are discussed first. This is followed by the mean field theory of the phases transitions? discussed using second quantized formalism? together with the various experimental observations on the transition and on the ground states. Fluctuation effects and the collective excitations are reviewed next, using the Ginzburg-Landau formalism, followed by the review of the interaction of these states with the underlying lattice and with impurities. The final chapters are devoted to the response of the ground states to external perturbations.",

Dressel and Gruener see their book as a modern successor to the 1972 classic text by Frederick Wooten, which is aimed toward advanced graduate students who will be studying the properties of those materials.The subject matter in this field has burgeoned, particularly with the applications of lasers and optical information technology, but the basics remain the same.

The active electrodes were made from sprayed networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) serving as both electrodes and charge collectors. Using a printable aqueous gel electrolyte as well as an organic liquid electrolyte, the performances of the devices show very high energy and power densities (6 W h\/kg for both electrolytes and 23 and 70 kW\/kg for aqueous gel electrolyte and organic electrolyte, respectively) which is comparable to performance in other SWCNT-based supercapacitor devices fabricated using different methods. The results underline the potential of printable thin film supercapacitors.

            "We have used nanoscale field effect transistor devices with carbon nanotubes as the conducting channel to detect protein binding. A PEI\/PEG polymer coating layer has been employed to avoid nonspecific binding, with attachment of biotin to the layer for specific molecular recognition. Biotin-streptavidin binding has been detected by changes in the device characteristic. Nonspecific binding was observed in devices without the polymer coating, while no binding was found for polymer-coated but not biotinylated devices. Streptavidin, in which the biotin-binding sites were blocked by reaction with excess biotin, produced essentially no change in device characteristic of the biotinylated polymer-coated devices. ",

The films display high conductivity, high carrier mobility and optical transparency, in addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental resistance. These attributes, coupled with room temperature printing or spraying technology, ensure that the material will have a significant impact on a variety of emerging technologies and markets, ranging from macroelectronics to solid state lighting, organic solar cells and smart fabrics. The performance parameters of the first devices fabricated \u2013 smart windows, OLEDs and organic solar cells \u2013 indicate that the material is ready for product development",
