The LHC is designed with a maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz and the ATLAS trigger system is designed to record approximately 200 of these per second. The trigger system selects events by rapidly identifying signatures of muon, electron, photon, tau lepton, jet, and B meson candidates, as well as using global event signatures, such as missing transverse energy. An overview of the ATLAS trigger system, the evolution of the system during 2010 and the performance of the trigger system components and selections based on the 2010 collision data are shown. A brief outline of plans for the trigger system in 2011 is presented.",

            "Measurements of luminosity obtained using the ATLAS detector during early running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at  TeV are presented. The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these methods are monitored as a function of time and of \u03bc, the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and \u03bc-dependence between the methods is less than 2% for 0<\u03bc<2.5. Absolute luminosity calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic uncertainty of \u00b111%, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents. After calibration, the luminosities obtained from the different methods differ by at most \u00b12%. The visible cross sections measured using the beam \u2026",
