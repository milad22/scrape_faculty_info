            "Theoretical results for the ab-plane tunneling conductance in the d-wave model for high-T c superconductors are presented. The d-wave model predicts surface bound states below the maximum gap. A subdominant order parameter, stabilized by the surface, leads to a splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) in zero external field and to spontaneous surface currents. In a magnetic field, screening currents shift the bound state spectrum, leading to a splitting of the ZBCP that is linear in H at low fields and saturates at a pair breaking critical field of order H c*\u2243 3 T.",

            "I review the principal theories that have been proposed for the superconducting phases of UPt3. The detailed H-T phase diagram places constraints on any theory for the multiple superconducting phases. Much attention has been given to the Ginzberg-Landau region of the phase diagram where the phase boundaries of three phases appear to meet at a tetracritical point. It has been argued that the existence of a tetracritical point for all field orientations eliminates the two-dimensional (2D) orbital representations coupled to a symmetry-breaking field (SBF) as a viable theory of these phases and favours either a theory based on two primary order parameters belonging to different irreducible representations that are accidentally degenerate, as described by Chen and Garg 1993, or a spin-triplet, orbital one-dimensional representation with non spin-orbit coupling in the pairing channel, as described by Machida and \u2026",

            "We use the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to calculate the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity. The theory is formulated for low temperatures when heat transport is limited by electron scattering from random defects and for superconductors with nodes in the order parameter. We show that certain eigenvalues of the thermal conductivity tensor are universal at low temperature, k BT\u226a \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the bandwidth of impurity bound states in the superconducting phase. The components of the electrical and thermal conductivity also obey a Wiedemann-Franz law with the Lorenz ratio L (T)= \u03ba\/\u03c3T given by the Sommerfeld value of L S=(\u03c0 2\/3)(k B\/e) 2 for k BT\u226a \u03b3. For intermediate temperatures the Lorenz ratio deviates significantly from L S, and is strongly dependent on the scattering cross section, and qualitatively different for resonant vs nonresonant scattering.
