            "Molecular dynamics simulations are presented for condensed-phase electron transfer (ET) systems where the electronic polarizability of both the solvent and the solute is incorporated. The solute polarizability is allowed to change with electronic transition. The results display notable deviation from the standard free energy parabolas of traditional ET theories. A new three-parameter ET model is applied, and the theory is shown to accurately model the free energy surfaces. This paper presents conclusive evidence that the traditional theory for the free energy barrier of ET reactions requires modification. ",

The Stokes shifts for the charge transfer, optical transitions of (tetrahydro-4H-thiopyran-4-ylidene)propanedinitrile indicate that the solvent reorganization energy for ET decreases with temperature, whereas dielectric continuum theories of solvent reorganization predict an increase with temperature. A molecular alternative to the continuum description is proposed that models the solvent as a fluid of polarizable, dipolar hard spheres. Good agreement between the molecular theory and experiment is achieved for both the ET reorganization energy and equilibrium energy gap. The negative temperature slope of the solvent reorganization energy is understood in terms of its dissection into components arising from different solute\u2212solvent \u2026",

The theory represents the solvent response as a combination of the density and polarization fluctuations of the solvent given in terms of the density and polarization structure factors. A fully analytical formulation of the theory is provided for a solute of arbitrary shape with an arbitrary distribution of charge. A good agreement between the analytical procedure and the results of Monte Carlo simulations of model systems is achieved. The reorganization energy splits into the contributions from density fluctuations and polarization fluctuations. The polarization part is dominated by longitudinal polarization response. The density part is inversely proportional to temperature. The dependence of the solvent reorganization energy on the solvent dipole moment and refractive index is discussed.",

The calculations are performed for solvents ranging from nondipolar to strongly dipolar. The solvent dependence of both the experimental Stokes shift and the spectral width is satisfactorily reproduced over the whole polarity range. The optical width is shown to demonstrate a qualitatively different solvent dependence for absorption and emission.

            "The solvent reorganization energy of outer sphere electron transfer in polar liquids is derived in a molecular treatment. The reorganization energy is shown to be the sum of two contributions: the reorganization energy of reorientation of liquid permanent dipoles and and the energy of reorganization of the liquid density. Reorientation of the dipoles gives the main contribution to the solvent reorganization energy, whereas reorganization of the density contributes mainly to the activation entropy which is positive in the normal and negative in the inverted regions of electron transfer. The reorganization energy of the liquid density contains an explicit temperature dependence which causes the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the rate constant. Entropy, enthalpy and volume of activation are found for several solvents.",

            "Despite its diversity, life universally relies on a simple basic mechanism of energy transfer in its energy chains\u2014hopping electron transport between centers of electron localization on hydrated proteins and redox cofactors. Since many such hops connect the point of energy input with a catalytic site where energy is stored in chemical bonds, the question of energy losses in (nearly activationless) electron hops, i.e., energetic efficiency, becomes central for the understanding of the energetics of life. We show here that standard considerations based on rules of Gibbs thermodynamics are not sufficient, and the dynamics of the protein and the protein\u2013water interface need to be involved. The rate of electronic transitions is primarily sensitive to the electrostatic potential at the center of electron localization. Numerical simulations show that the statistics of the electrostatic potential produced by hydration water are strongly \u2026",
