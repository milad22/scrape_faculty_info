            "The flow-equation method was proposed by Wegner as a technique for studying interacting systems in one dimension. Here, we apply this method to a disordered one-dimensional model with power-law decaying hoppings. This model presents a transition as function of the decaying exponent \u03b1. We derive the flow equations and the evolution of single-particle operators. The flow equation reveals the delocalized nature of the states for \u03b1< 1 2. Additionally, in the regime \u03b1> 1 2, we present a strong-bond renormalization group structure based on iterating the three-site clusters, where we solve the flow equations perturbatively. This renormalization group approach allows us to probe the critical point \u03b1= 1. This method correctly reproduces the critical level-spacing statistics and the fractal dimensionality of the eigenfunctions.",

In this paper, we present measurements of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) and de Haas-van Alphen effects under high magnetic fields for the type-II Weyl semimetallic candidate NbIrTe 4. We find that the angular dependence of the observed Fermi surface extremal cross-sectional areas agree well with our density functional theory (DFT) calculations supporting the existence of Weyl type-II points in this material. Although we observe a large and nonsaturating magnetoresistivity in NbIrTe 4 under fields all the way up to 35 T, Hall-effect measurements indicate that NbIrTe 4 is not a compensated semimetal. The transverse magnetoresistivity displays a fourfold angular \u2026",

We show that, in general, there is an antiferromagnetic phase with an emergent SU (2 S+ 1) symmetry. The ground state of this phase is a random singlet state in which the singlets are formed by pairs of spins. For integer spins, there is an additional antiferromagnetic phase which does not exhibit any emergent symmetry (except for S= 1). The corresponding ground state is a random singlet one but the singlets are formed mostly by trios of spins. In each case the corresponding low-energy dynamics is activated, ie, with a formally infinite dynamical exponent, and related to distinct infinite-randomness fixed points.

The phases with emergent SU(N) symmetry are of two kinds: one has a ground state formed of randomly distributed singlets of strongly bound pairs of SO(N) spins (a \u2018mesonic\u2019 phase), while the other has a ground state composed of singlets made out of strongly bound integer multiples of N SO(N) spins (a \u2018baryonic\u2019 phase). The established mechanism is general and we put forward the cases of N = 2, 3, 4 and 6 as prime candidates for experimental realizations in material compounds and cold-atoms systems.

            "The interplay of disorder and interactions is a challenging topic of condensed matter physics, where correlations are crucial and exotic phases develop. In one spatial dimension, a particularly successful method to analyze such problems is the strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). This method, which is asymptotically exact in the limit of large disorder, has been successfully employed in the study of several phases of random magnetic chains. Here we develop an SDRG scheme capable of providing in-depth information on a large class of strongly disordered one-dimensional magnetic chains with a global invariance under a generic continuous group. Our methodology can be applied to any Lie-algebra valued spin Hamiltonian, in any representation. As examples, we focus on the physically relevant cases of SO (N) and Sp (N) magnetism, showing the existence of different randomness-dominated phases \u2026",

Effective Chern-Simons theories have suggested the existence of multiple interaction-induced short-range entangled phases also at integer quantum Hall plateaus. Among these, a bosonic phase has been proposed with edge modes carrying representations based on the E 8 exceptional Lie algebra. Through a theoretical coupled-wire construction, we provide an explicit microscopic model for this E 8 Abelian quantum Hall state, at filling \u03bd= 16, and discuss how it is intimately related to topological paramagnets in 3+ 1 dimensions. Still using coupled wires, we partition the E 8 state into a pair of non-Abelian, long-range entangled states. These two states occur at filling \u03bd= 8, demonstrating that even topological order may also exist at integer Hall plateaus. These phases are bosonic, carry \u2026",

We find that the geometry of their FSs agrees well with DFT predictions. ZrSiSe displays low residual resistivities, pronounced magnetoresistivity, high carrier mobilities, and a butterflylike angle-dependent magnetoresistivity (AMR), although its DNL is not protected against gap opening. As in Cd 3 As 2, its transport lifetime is found to be 10 2 to 10 3 times larger than its quantum one. ZrSiTe, which possesses a protected DNL, displays conventional transport properties.

In solid-state systems such quasiparticles, which are exemplified by neutral dipolar excitations, lead to long-range correlations of local observables and may dominate energy transport.
