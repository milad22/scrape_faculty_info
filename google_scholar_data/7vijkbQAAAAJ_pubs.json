            "We give an overview of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Explorer Mission launched on 2003 April 28. GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350\u20131750 and 1750\u20132750 \u00c5). The surveys include an all\u2010sky imaging survey ( ), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 ( ), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 ( ), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys ( ) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the \u2026",

The instrument consists of four co\u2010aligned prime\u2010focus telescopes and Rowland spectrographs with microchannel plate detectors. Two of the telescope channels use Al:LiF coatings for optimum reflectivity between approximately 1000 and 1187 \u00c5, and the other two channels use SiC coatings for optimized throughput between 905 and 1105 \u00c5. The gratings are holographically ruled to correct largely for astigmatism and to minimize scattered light. The microchannel plate detectors have KBr photocathodes and use photon counting to achieve good quantum efficiency with low background signal. The sensitivity is sufficient to examine reddened lines of sight within the Milky Way and also sufficient to use as active galactic nuclei and QSOs for absorption\u2010line studies of both \u2026",

            "Ultraviolet imaging with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) has revealed an extensive sample of UV\u2010bright stellar complexes in the extreme outer disk of M83, extending to about 4 times the radius at which the majority of H ii regions are detected ( , or 6.6 kpc). These sources are typically associated with large\u2010scale filamentary H i structures in the warped outer disk of M83 and are distributed beyond the galactocentric radii at which molecular interstellar medium has yet been detected. We present measured properties of these stellar complexes, including far\u2010UV and near\u2010UV magnitudes and local gas surface density. Only a subset of the outer\u2010disk UV sources have corresponding H ii regions detected in H\u03b1 imaging, consistent with a sample of mixed age in which some sources are a few megayears old and others are much more evolved (\u223c108 yr).",

We give the expansion of the electric dipole amplitude E 0+ to three orders in \u03bc the ratio of the pion to nucleon mass, and show that it is slowly converging. We argue that this observable is not a good testing ground for the chiral dynamics of QCD. In contrast, we exhibit new and fastly converging low-energy theorems in the P-waves which should be used to constrain the data analysis. We also discuss the importance of polarization observables to accurately pin down certain multipoles and give predictions for the reaction \u03b3 n \u2192 \u03c00 n.",
