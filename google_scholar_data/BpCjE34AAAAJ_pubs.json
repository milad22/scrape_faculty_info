            "Networks of filamentous proteins play a crucial role in cell mechanics. These cytoskeletal networks, together with various cross-linking and other associated proteins largely determine the (visco) elastic response of cells. In this Letter we study a model system of cross-linked, stiff filaments in order to explore the connection between the microstructure under strain and the macroscopic response of cytoskeletal networks. We find two distinct regimes as a function primarily of cross-link density and filament rigidity: one characterized by affine deformation and one by nonaffine deformation. We characterize the crossover between these two.",

These properties, in turn, influence the ability of RBCs to transport oxygen in circulation. Current mechanical measurements of RBCs rely on external loads. Here we apply a noncontact optical interferometric technique to quantify the thermal fluctuations of RBC membranes with 3 nm accuracy over a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Combining this technique with a new mathematical model describing RBC membrane undulations, we measure the mechanical changes of RBCs as they undergo a transition from the normal discoid shape to the abnormal echinocyte and spherical shapes. These measurements indicate that, coincident with this morphological transition, there is a significant increase in the membrane\u2019s shear \u2026",

To address this issue, we have performed numerical studies of the linear response of homogeneous and isotropic two-dimensional networks subject to an applied strain at zero temperature. The elastic moduli are found to vanish for network densities at a rigidity percolation threshold. For higher densities, two regimes are observed: one in which the deformation is predominately affine and the filaments stretch and compress; and a second in which bending modes dominate. We identify a dimensionless scalar quantity, being a combination of the material length scales, that specifies to which regime a given network belongs. A scaling argument is presented that approximately agrees with this crossover variable. By a direct \u2026",

We analyze the stability of sandpiles with such forces, and find that the critical angle is unchanged in the limit of an infinitely large system; however, this angle is increased for finite-sized systems. The failure occurs in the bulk of the sandpile rather than at the surface. This is related to a standard result in soil mechanics. The increase in the critical angle is determined by the surface roughness of the particles, and exhibits three regimes as a function of the added-fluid volume. Our theory is in qualitative agreement with the recent experimental results of Hornbaker et al., although our interpretation differs.",

            "We measure the increase in the maximum stable angle of a sandpile, \u03b8 c, with the volume fraction, \u03c6, of a liquid added to cause cohesion between the grains. For two different liquids, tan \u03b8 c does not apparently scale with the air-liquid surface tension at low \u03c6, whereas it does at higher \u03c6. This suggests that the liquid forms menisci at asperities on the surfaces of the grains before filling cohesive menisci at intergrain contact points. In this cohesive limit, \u03b8 c (\u03c6) agrees with a surface roughness theory. Electron and fluorescence microscopy of the dry and wet surfaces of the grains support this model.",
