            "WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat \u039b\u2010dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale\u2010invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best\u2010fit parameters are  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large\u2010scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly\u03b1 forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon\/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D\/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB \u2026",

These attributes were key factors in the success of NASA\u2019s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission, which made a 7\u00b0 FWHM resolution full sky map, discovered temperature anisotropy, and characterized the fluctuations with two parameters, a power spectral index and a primordial amplitude. Following COBE, considerable progress has been made in higher resolution measurements of the temperature anisotropy. With 45 times the sensitivity and 33 times the angular resolution of the COBE mission, MAP will vastly extend our knowledge of cosmology. MAP \u2026",

The observatory systems are largely performing as expected, and the projected cryogenic lifetime is in excess of 5 years. This paper summarizes the on\u2010orbit scientific, technical, and operational performance of Spitzer. Subsequent papers in this special issue describe the Spitzer instruments in detail and highlight many of the exciting scientific results obtained during the first 6 months of the Spitzer mission.",

            "This paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of WMAP data alone. A simple \u039bCDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic parameters of the model are consistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: \u03a9 b h 2= 0.02273\u00b10.00062, \u03a9 c h 2= 0.1099\u00b10.0062, \u03a9 \u039b= 0.742\u00b10.030, n s= 0.963+ 0.014\u20130.015, \u03c4= 0.087\u00b10.017, and \u03c3 8= 0.796\u00b10.036, with h= 0.719+ 0.026\u20130.027. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, \u03c4> 0, at 5\u03c3 significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z reion= 11.0\u00b11.4 with 68% confidence. The 2\u03c3 lower limit is z reion> 8.2, and the 3\u03c3 limit is z reion> 6.7. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z= 6 at more than 3.5 \u03c3 significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized \u2026",

The full nine-year analysis of the time-ordered data provides updated characterizations and calibrations of the experiment. We also provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new foreground-reduced CMB maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C\u20131 weighting to compute the temperature angular power spectrum \u2026",
