Operando infrared (IR) spectroscopy, polarization modulated IR spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) of Pt\u2212Nafion interfaces, and attenuated total reflectance IR spectroscopy of bulk Nafion were correlated by density functional theory (DFT) calculated spectra to elucidate Nafion functional group coadsorption responsible for the Stark tuning of COads on high surface area fuel cell electrodes.

            "Nafion, a sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, and its short-side-chain derivative revolutionized low-temperature fuel cell development. Nevertheless, after over 7000 publications on Nafion since 1975, 1 the definitive assignment of key infrared (IR) peaks, including those associated with the SO3-exchange group and the ether linkages, has been elusive. Nafion and relevant derivatives are given in Scheme 1. The highlights of reported interpretations of selected IR spectra (Figure 1a-f) provide the context for this Communication. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra of hydrated Nafion (a) and the short-side-chain ionomer (b)(ie, Scheme 1) focus on the\u223c 1060 cm-1 and a multiplet that includes a shoulder at 995 cm-1 and two peaks\u223c 983 and 970 cm-1, hereafter referred to as \u03bdhhf and \u03bdhlf, respectively. The \u03bdhf and \u03bdlf have been conventionally assigned to ether groups in proximity to the backbone and the sulfonate group, respectively. Cable et al. 2 associated \u03bdhlf to the ether linkage closest to the sulfonate group because of its enhanced sensitivity to ion exchange and the fact that the \u03bdhlf persists in the Dow short-side-chain ionomer spectrum. The short-side-chain ionomer has only one ether group, positioned adjacent to the sulfonate group. The sulfonyl fluoride precursor was also compared to Nafion. In the sulfonyl fluoride spectrum (c), \u03bdhlf diminishes concurrently with the\u223c 1060 cm-1 peak. These observations were reconciled by invoking solvation effects as responsible for the sensitivity of \u03bdhlf to ion exchange because in hydrated Nafion, the sulfonate group is embedded in an aqueous phase. Therefore, the ether group in \u2026",

            "Cluster and periodic density functional theory (DFT) of carbon monoxide adsorbed atop on Pt (COads) show that ruthenium alloying weakens both the COads internal and C\u2212Pt bonds and reduces the COads adsorption energy. A new theoretical model based on the \u03c0-attraction \u03c3-repulsion is used to explain the above results. This model correlates (1) Mulliken population, (2) density-of-states analysis of the COads orbitals, (3) the individual interaction of these orbitals with the metal lattice bands, and (4) their polarizations within the COads molecule. In this study, the \u03c3 interaction has both attractive and repulsive components via electron donation to the metal bands and Pauli repulsion, respectively. Cluster DFT shows that the overall weakening of the COads internal bond upon alloying is due to the dominance of reduced \u03c3 donation to the metal (which weakens the COads internal bond) over increased \u03c0 bonding \u2026",

These calculations reveal that Cu form primarily covalent bonds with graphene atoms via strong hybridization between the adatom orbitals and the sp band of the graphene substrate, whereas the interaction of the Ru and Os with graphene also contain ionic parts.
