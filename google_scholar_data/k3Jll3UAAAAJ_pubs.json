Results on the reduction capabilities of phytochemicals present in tea to reduce gold salts to the corresponding gold nanoparticles are presented in this paper. The phytochemicals present in tea serve a dual role as effective reducing agents to reduce gold and also as stabilizers to provide a robust coating on the gold nanoparticles in a single step. The tea-generated gold nanoparticles (T-AuNPs), have demonstrated remarkable in vitro stability in various buffers including saline, histidine, HSA, and cysteine solutions. T-AuNPs with phytochemical coatings have shown significant affinity toward prostate (PC-3) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells.

            "Water is an environmentally (and biologically) benign solvent, and therefore, development of chemistry in aqueous media has long been a desirable goal for chemists. In particular, chemistry of water-soluble transition metal compounds has gained considerable prominence in recent years because of their usefulness in biphasic (aqueous-organic) catalysis1 and biomedicine. 2 High solubility of transition metal compounds in water becomes a primary requirement in the design and development of catalysts for use under biphasic media because of the need for efficient separation and recovery of expensive transition metal catalysts (in aqueous media) from organic products. Additionally, the ability of specific transition metals to exert therapeutic (and diagnostic) influence on certain diseases has provided increased impetus in the development of new water-soluble and in vivo-stable transition metal compounds. 2, 3 Of \u2026",
