In this review, dense monolayers of simple lipids are described in detail, including structures revealed by x-ray-diffraction experiments, computer simulations, molecular models, and a phenomenological theory of phase transitions. The effects of chirality and the structures of phospholipid monolayers are considered. Open questions and possible approaches to finding answers are discussed.",

For all temperatures studied the isotherms in the \u03c0a plane show a kink, signaling a phase transition. Along an isotherm, and for pressures above the kink, we observe that the transverse structure factor has one peak which has constant position, width, and intensity; below the kink the diffraction peak shifts to smaller scattering vector (larger separation) and the amplitude decays as the surface pressure decreases, but the width of the peak remains constant. We rationalize these observations in terms of the influence on the transverse structure factor of gauche configurations in the amphiphile tails, with the kink representing the point at which the last of the gauche configurations is squeezed out of the chain. Along an isobar which is at higher pressure than the kink \u2026",

The liquid was tetrakis (2-ethylhexoxy) silane (TEHOS), which is nonpolar and insulating, with spherical molecules of about 10 \u00c5 diameter. We studied both thin (45\u201390 \u00c5) and relatively thick (\u223c5000 \u00c5) films, which are prepared by dipping in a dilute solution and by pouring and draining the pure material, respectively. For 45\u201390 \u00c5 thick films, three layers of density oscillations are seen near the solid\u2013liquid interface, with a spacing comparable to the molecular size. There is an inverse dependence on the substrate surface roughness. For \u223c5000 \u00c5 thick films, we observed a diffraction peak with a correlation length of \u223c32 \u00c5.",
