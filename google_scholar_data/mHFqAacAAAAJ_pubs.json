            "The momentum distribution in a Fermi gas with two spin states and a large scattering length has a tail that falls off like 1\/k 4 at large momentum k, as pointed out by Tan. He used novel methods to derive exact relations between the coefficient of the tail in the momentum distribution and various other properties of the system. We present simple derivations of these relations using the operator product expansion for quantum fields. We identify the coefficient as the integral over space of the expectation value of a local operator that measures the density of pairs.",

This suggests that two-and three-body interactions are sufficient to renormalize the four-body system. We apply the equations to H 4 e atoms and calculate the binding energy of the H 4 e tetramer.

This transient free charge\u2013polarization mismatch is driven by the negative curvature of the FE free-energy landscape, and it is also analytically shown that a free-energy profile with a negative curvature is the only physical system that can describe transient NC in a R-FEC circuit.
