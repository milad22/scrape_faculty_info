            "Estrogen receptors (ERs) are believed to be ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which on ligand binding translocate into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. To date, two ERs have been identified: ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. ER\u03b1 plays major role in the estrogen-mediated genomic actions in both reproductive and nonreproductive tissue, whereas the function of ER\u03b2 is still unclear. In this study, we used immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and proteomics to demonstrate that ER\u03b2 localizes to the mitochondria. In immunocytochemistry studies, ER\u03b2 was detected with two ER\u03b2 antibodies and found to colocalize almost exclusively with a mitochondrial marker in rat primary neuron, primary cardiomyocyte, and a murine hippocampal cell line. The colocalization of ER\u03b2 and mitochondrial markers was identified by both fluorescence and confocal microscopy. No translocation of \u2026",

Unfortunately, none of the neuroprotectants has been proved effective in clinical trails. In the current study, we demonstrated that methylene blue (MB) functions as an alternative electron carrier, which accepts electrons from NADH and transfers them to cytochrome c and bypasses complex I\/III blockage. A de novo synthesized MB derivative, with the redox center disabled by N-acetylation, had no effect on mitochondrial complex activities. MB increases cellular oxygen consumption rates and reduces anaerobic glycolysis in cultured neuronal cells. MB is protective against various insults in vitro at low nanomolar concentrations.

            "Substantial evidence now exists that intrinsic free-radical scavenging contributes to the receptor-independent neuroprotective effects of estrogens. This activity is inherently associated with the presence of a phenolic A-ring in the steroid. We report a previously unrecognized antioxidant cycle that maintains the \u201cchemical shield\u201d raised by estrogens against the most harmful reactive oxygen species, the hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) produced by the Fenton reaction. In this cycle, the capture of \u2022OH was shown to produce a nonphenolic quinol with no affinity to the estrogen receptors. This quinol is then rapidly converted back to the parent estrogen via an enzyme-catalyzed reduction by using NAD(P)H as a coenzyme (reductant) and, unlike redox cycling of catechol estrogens, without the production of reactive oxygen species. Due to this process, protection of neuronal cells against oxidative stress is also possible by quinols \u2026",

            "Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP17). However, the cellular origin and the consequence of the NFT formation are poorly understood. Epidemiological evidence suggests a much higher occurrence of dementia in stroke patients. This may represent the pathogenesis of sporadic AD, which accounts for the majority of AD occurrence. Here we show that after a transient cerebral ischemia, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates in cortical neurons in a site-specific manner. The hyperphosphorylated tau presents a conformation similar to those present in human tauopathies, and colocalizes largely with signs of apoptosis. Our current study suggests that tau hyperphosphorylation may contribute to the brain damage \u2026",
