It is explained why they present significant progress over the corresponding IAU 1991 resolutions and why they are necessary in the light of present accuracies in astrometry, celestial mechanics, and metrology. In fact, most of these resolutions are consistent with astronomical models and software already in use. The metric tensors and gravitational potentials of both the Barycentric Celestial Reference System and the Geocentric Celestial Reference System are defined and discussed. The necessity and relevance of the two celestial reference systems are explained. The transformations of coordinates and gravitational potentials are discussed.

At closest approach, general relativity (GR) predicts a radial (static) deflection of 1190 \u03bcas and a tangential (retarded) deflection in the direction of Jupiter\u2019s motion of 51 \u03bcas. Our experiment achieved an rms position error of \u226410 \u03bcas and measured this retarded deflection to be   (rms error) times that predicted by GR.

In so doing, it fills the need for a textbook that teaches modern dynamical astronomy with a strong emphasis on the relativistic aspects of the subject produced by the curved geometry of four-dimensional spacetime. The first three chapters review the fundamental principles of celestial mechanics and of special and general relativity. This background material forms the basis for understanding relativistic reference frames, the celestial mechanics of N-body systems, and high-precision astrometry, navigation, and geodesy, which are then treated in the following five chapters. The final chapter provides an overview of the new field of applied relativity, based on recent recommendations from the International Astronomical Union. The book is suitable for teaching advanced undergraduate honors programs and graduate courses, while equally serving as a reference for professional research scientists working in relativity and dynamical astronomy. The authors bring their extensive theoretical and practical experience to the subject.

Unfortunately, perhaps the most intriguing system where such a tool could be used, a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, has yet to be discovered. In this paper we give a detailed investigation of what one can learn about the black hole companion via timing observations of the pulsar. We present an analytic calculation for the propagation delay caused by the frame-dragging effect and show that it has the same functional behavior as the modulation of the observed rotational phase of the pulsar caused by the deflection of the radio signals in the gravitational field of the companion (bending delay). Thus, contrary to statements of other authors, the frame-dragging delay is unlikely to be separately measurable in pulsar binaries where the companion is a \u2026",

            "In the weak-field and slow-motion approximation of the General Relativity theory the relativistic theory of construction of nonrotating harmonic coordinate reference systems is developed. The general case of an isolated astronomicalN-body system is considered. The bodies are assumed to consist of a perfect fluid and to possess any number of the internal mass and current multipole moments characterizing the internal structure and own gravitational field of the bodies. The description of the coordinate reference systems and gravitational field is realized by the specific forms of the metric tensor. A metric is determined by the method of the Post-Newtonian Approximations (PNA) from the inhomogeneous Einstein equations under the harmonic coordinate condition. We have obtained two different specific forms of a metric, which are related to the inertial and quasiinertial coordinate reference systems \u2026",
