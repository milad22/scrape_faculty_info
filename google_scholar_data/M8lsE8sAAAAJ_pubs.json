            "In this paper, we systematically classify and describe bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in all physical spatial dimensions using semiclassical nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) field theories. All the SPT phases on a d-dimensional lattice discussed in this paper can be described by the same NLSM, which is an O (d+ 2) NLSM in (d+ 1)-dimensional space-time, with a topological \u0398 term. The field in the NLSM is a semiclassical Landau order parameter with a unit length constraint. The classification of SPT phases discussed in this paper based on their NLSMs is Completely Identical to the more mathematical classification based on group cohomology given in X. Chen, Z.-C. Gu, Z.-X. Liu, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. B 87, 155114 (2013) and Science 338, 1604 (2012). Besides the classification, the formalism used in this paper also allows us to explicitly discuss the physics at the boundary of the SPT \u2026",

We show that the maximal chaotic non-Fermi-liquid phase described by the ordinary q= 4 SYK model has marginally relevant or irrelevant (depending on the sign of the coupling constants) four-fermion perturbations allowed by symmetry. Changing the sign of one of these four-fermion perturbations leads to a continuous chaotic-nonchaotic quantum phase transition of the system accompanied by a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Starting with the SYK q model with a q-fermion interaction, similar perturbations can lead to a series of new fixed points with continuously varying exponents.",

Later, group supercohomology was proposed as a partial classification for SPT phases of interacting fermions. In this work, we revisit this problem based on the algebraic theory of symmetry and defects in two-dimensional topological phases. We reproduce the partial classifications given by group supercohomology, and we also show that with an additional H 1 (G, Z 2) structure, a complete classification of SPT phases for two-dimensional interacting fermion systems with a total symmetry group G\u00d7 Z 2 f is obtained.

These phase transitions often involve emergent deconfined gauge fields at the critical points as demonstrated in phase transitions between different broken-symmetry states of 2+ 1-dimensional quantum magnets, as well as those between symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. In this paper, we present several examples of deconfined quantum critical points between SPT phases in 3+ 1-D for both bosonic and fermionic systems. These critical theories can be formulated as non-Abelian gauge theories either in the infrared-free regime or in the conformal window when they flow to the Banks-Zaks fixed points.

If the symmetry action of the field theory is nonanomalous, ie, the corresponding bulk state is a trivial state instead of a bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state, then a featureless ground state of the spin system is allowed; if the corresponding bulk state is indeed a nontrivial SPT state, then it likely excludes the existence of a featureless ground \u2026",
