Briefly, absorbed fractions for monoenergeticelectrons were calculated with point source kernels and integration over the volume of the sphere. These were then used to calculate absorbed fractions for radionuclides by integration over beta-spectra generated by the computer code SPEBETA (9). Figure 1 shows the relationship between 4@ and sphere diameter for a selection of four of the radionuclides considered. It is apparent that the limitingvalue of4@ is 1 for a volume distribution. This means that as the sphere becomesvery large in comparisonto the radionucide emission range, almost all the energy is absorbedwhen the radionuclideis evenly distributed throughout the volume.",

In addition, heterogeneity of radionuclide uptake is predicted to be a serious limitation on the ultimate therapeutic effect of targeted Auger therapy. Possible methods of targeting include the use of analogues of DNA precursors such as iodo-deoxyuridine and molecules which bind DNA such as steroid hormones or growth factors. A longer term possibility may be the use of molecules such as oligonucleotides which can discriminate at the level of DNA sequence. It seems likely \u2026",

Fractionation is a strategy for overcoming heterogeneity of monoclonal antibody (MAb) distribution in the tumor and the consequent nonuniformity of tumor radiation doses. Additional advantages of fractionated RIT are the ability to 1) provide patient\u2010specific radionuclide and radiation dosing, 2) control toxicity by titration of the individual patient, 3) reduce toxicity, 4) increase the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for many patients, 5) increase tumor radiation dose and efficacy, and 6) prolong tumor response by permitting treatment over time.

Origi nally usedfor acutehigh-dose-rateirradiations, theLQ modelhas been extended to include low-dose-rate treatments, including brachytherapy and biologically targeted radionuclide therapy (21\u00e2\u20ac\u201d",

We performed a first-in-human phase I\/II study of 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 (89Zr-J591) PET\/CT immunoscintigraphy to assess performance characteristics for detecting metastases compared with conventional imaging modalities (CIM) and pathology.Experimental Design: Fifty patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers were injected with 5 mCi of 89Zr-J591. Whole-body PET\/CT scans were obtained, and images were analyzed for tumor visualization. Comparison was made to contemporaneously obtained bone scintigraphy and cross-sectional imaging on a lesion-by-lesion basis and with biopsies of metastatic sites.Results: Median standardized uptake value for 89Zr-J591\u2013positive bone \u2026",
