Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface.

Upon visible light excitation, CdSe QDs inject electrons into TiO2 nanocrystallites. Femtosecond transient absorption as well as emission quenching experiments confirm the injection from the excited state of CdSe QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles. Electron transfer from the thermally relaxed s-state occurs over a wide range of rate constant values between 7.3 \u00d7 109 and 1.95 \u00d7 1011 s-1. The injected charge carriers in a CdSe-modified TiO2 film can be collected at a conducting electrode to generate a photocurrent. The TiO2\u2212CdSe composite, when employed as a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell, exhibits a photon-to-charge carrier generation efficiency of 12%.

The lowest energy exciton, eightfold degenerate in spherically symmetric dots, is split into five levels by the crystal shape asymmetry, the intrinsic crystal field (in hexagonal lattice structures), and the electron-hole exchange interaction. Transition oscillator strengths and the size dependence of the splittings have been calculated. Two of the five states, including the ground state, are optically passive (dark excitons). The oscillator strengths of the other three levels (bright excitons) depend strongly on crystal size, shape, and energy band parameters. The relative ordering of the energy levels is also heavily influenced by these parameters. The distance between the first \u2026",

Because of their large surface to volume ratios it has been suggested that the emission originates from surface-related states. However, recent theory suggests that the band edge luminescence arises from an optically inactive fine structure state or \u201cdark\u201d exciton. To address this issue we modify the surface of CdSe nanocrystallites with a variety of organic and inorganic ligands. We then monitor the effect changing the surface has on the energetics of the band edge luminescence through photoluminescence and fluorescence line narrowing experiments.

            "We describe the preparation and characterization of bioinorganic conjugates in which luminescent semiconductor CdSe\u2212ZnS core\u2212shell nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) were coupled to antibodies through the use of an avidin bridge adsorbed to the nanocrystal surface via electrostatic self-assembly. Avidin, a highly positively charged protein, was found to adsorb tightly to QDs modified with dihydrolipoic acid, which gives their surface a homogeneous negative charge. QD conjugation to biotinylated antibodies subsequently is readily achieved. Fluoroimmunoassays utilizing these antibody conjugated QDs were successful in the detection of protein toxins (staphylococcal enterotoxin B, cholera toxin). QD-antibody conjugates formed in such a facile manner permit their use as a common immuno reagent, and in the development of multianalyte detection. ",

            "Single molecule confocal microscopy is used to investigate the detailed kinetics of fluorescence intermittency in colloidal II\u2013VI (CdSe) semiconductor quantum dots. Two distinct modes of behavior are observed corresponding to (i) sustained \u201con\u201d episodes (\u03c4on) of rapid laser absorption\/fluorescence cycling, followed by (ii) sustained \u201coff\u201d episodes (\u03c4off) where essentially no light is emitted despite continuous laser excitation. Both on-time and off-time probability densities follow an inverse power law, P(\u03c4on\/off)\u221d1\/\u03c4on\/offm, over more than seven decades in probability density and five decades in time. Such inverse power law behavior is an unambiguous signature of highly distributed kinetics with rates varying over 105-fold, in contrast with models for switching between \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d configurations of the system via single rate constant processes. The unprecedented dynamic range of the current data permits several \u2026",
