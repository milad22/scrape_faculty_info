In this study, we have investigated the use of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and the tailoring of etch selectivity for precise fabrication. Silicon loading, the introduction of an O2 step, wafer electrode power, and wafer temperature are evaluated and determined to be effective for coarsely controlling etch selectivity in DRIE. The non-uniformity and surface roughness characteristics are evaluated and found to be scaled by the etch selectivity when the 3D profile is transferred into the silicon. A micro-compressor is demonstrated using gray-scale lithography and DRIE showing that etch selectivity can be successfully tailored for a specific application.",

In this study we have investigated two important design limitations for gray-scale lithography: the minimum usable pixel size and maximum usable pitch size. Together with the resolution of the projection lithography system and the spot size used to write the optical mask, the maximum range of usable gray levels can be determined for developing 3D large area silicon structures. An approximation of the minimum pixel size is shown and experimentally confirmed. Below this minimum, gray levels will be developed away due to an excessive amount of intensity passing through the optical mask. Additionally, oscillations in the intensity are investigated by the use of large pitch sizes on the optical mask. It was found that these oscillations cause holes in \u2026",

A Gaussian tail approximation is introduced as a method of predicting the height of photoresist gray levels given the relative amount of transmitted light through a gray-scale optical mask. Device mask design is accomplished through command-line scripting in a CAD tool to precisely define the millions of pixels required to generate the appropriate profile in photoresist. Etch selectivity during DRIE pattern transfer is accurately controlled to produce the desired scaling factor between the photoresist and silicon profiles. As a demonstration of this technology, a 1.6-mm diameter PFL is etched 43 \/spl mu\/m into silicon with each grating profile designed to focus 8.4 keV photons a distance of 118 m.",

Pixelated grayscale masks often suffer from limited vertical resolution due to restrictions on the mask fabrication. The double-exposure technique uses two pixelated grayscale mask exposures before development and dramatically increases the vertical resolution without altering the mask fabrication process. An empirical calibration technique was employed for mask design and was also applied to study the effects of exposure time and mask misalignment on the photoresist profile. This technology has been demonstrated to improve the average step between photoresist levels from 0.19 to 0.02 mum and the maximum step from 0.43 to 0.2 mum compared to a single pixelated exposure using the same mask design.",

It is shown that the ChG films can be used to make ultrathin (~600  nm), high-resolution grayscale patterns, which can find their application, for example, in IR optics. Unlike polymer photoresists, the IR transparent ChG patterns can be useful as such on the surface or can be used to transfer the etched pattern into silicon or other substrates. Even if the ChG is used as an etch mask for the silicon substrate, its greater hardness can achieve a greater etch selectivity than that obtained with organic photoresists.

            "Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication technologies originated directly from integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. IC devices require only two-dimensional or planar structures to be fabricated, because there are no mechanical operations taking place. Therefore structures fabricated for MEMS devices have been traditionally designed with nominally vertical sidewalls (dry anisotropic etching), undercut sidewalls (wet isotropic etching), or sidewalls that have limited angles due to the crystallographic orientation of the substrate (wet anisotropic etching). Assorted novel techniques have been developed in the MEMS field that can achieve 3-D structures. Such techniques include SU-8 molding using microstereolithography, directing ions in DRIE using buried dielectric layers, and by inclined rotating UV lithography and electroplating. These techniques however are very time consuming and\/or are limited in the \u2026",
