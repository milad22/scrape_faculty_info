During annealing at a given temperature, decay of magnetoresistance occurs much earlier compared to junctions with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Through a rapid thermal annealing study, the decrease of magnetoresistance is found to be associated with the degradation of perpendicular anisotropy, instead of impurity diffusion as observed in common in-plane junctions.

Among various parallel synthesis strategies, thin-film deposition combined with physical masks (or photolithography) and solution-based synthetic methods are the most commonly used techniques. 2 In solution-based parallel synthesis, droplets of precursor solutions are laid into predefined microreactors (usually microwells drilled into a ceramic substrate) from microdispensers (usually piezoelectricdriven ejectors). Then, the precursors are mixed and reacted to form a materials library. Through this method, materials libraries including phosphors, catalyst, etc., have been fabricated from solution precursors. 3, 4 Inkjet delivery shows many advantages over other microdispense apparatus, such as nanoliter dispensing capability with high accuracy. 5 However, a significant limitation of the above-mentioned technique is the applicability: only soluble compounds had been used as the precursors. On the other hand, a lot of suspensions have been used with the inkjet technique in ceramic freeforming, 6 fabrication of electronic devices, 7 and functionally graded material. 8 From this point of view, suspensions can be used with inkjet technique in solutionbased parallel synthesis if a universal preparation method of insoluble suspensions can be developed.

We show a detailed formalism of taking R E into account in modeling and demonstrate that the PCAR spectrum can be drastically affected by the presence of R E.
