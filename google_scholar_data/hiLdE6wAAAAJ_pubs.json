The optical and spin-relaxation properties of these samples were characterized using confocal microscopy, visible and infrared absorption, and optically detected magnetic resonance. The sample with the highest NV\u2212 concentration, approximately 16 ppm (2.8\u00d7 10 18 cm\u2212 3), was prepared with no observable traces of neutrally charged vacancy defects. The effective transverse spin-relaxation time for this sample was T 2\u2217= 118 (48) ns, predominately limited by residual paramagnetic nitrogen which was determined to have a concentration of 49 (7) ppm. Under ideal conditions, the shot-noise limited sensitivity is projected to be\u223c 150 fT\/Hz for a 100 \u03bc m-scale magnetometer based on this sample.

As individual quantum bits, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond are among the most promising solid-state systems identified to date, because of their long-lived electron and nuclear spin coherence, and capability for individual optical initialization, readout and information storage 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The major outstanding hurdle lies in interconnecting many nitrogen vacancies for large-scale computation. One of the most promising approaches in this regard is to couple them to optical resonators, which can be further interconnected in a photonic network 10, 11, 12.

The WSe2 photoluminescence intensity strongly depends on the relative alignment between photoexcited spins in WSe2 and the CrI3 magnetization, because of ultrafast spin-dependent charge hopping across the heterostructure interface.

This paper describes recent progress in realizing microcavities with low loss and small mode volume in two hybrid systems: silica microdisks coupled to diamond nanoparticles, and gallium phosphide microdisks coupled to single-crystal diamond. A theoretical proposal for a gallium phosphide nanowire photonic crystal cavity coupled to diamond is also discussed. Comparing the two material systems, silica microdisks are easier to fabricate and test. However, at low temperature, nitrogen-vacancy centers in bulk diamond are spectrally more stable, and we expect that in the long term the bulk diamond approach will be better suited for on-chip integration of a photonic network.",

Furthermore, studies on CVD diamond grown on (110)-oriented substrates show a near 100% preferential orientation of NV centers along only the [111] and [1 1 1] directions, rather than the four possible orientations.
