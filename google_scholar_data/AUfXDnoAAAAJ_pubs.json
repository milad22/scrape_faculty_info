            "We outline the construction of metastable de Sitter vacua of type IIB string theory. Our starting point is highly warped IIB compactifications with nontrivial NS and RR three-form fluxes. By incorporating known corrections to the superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation, one can make models with all moduli fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdS vacuum. Inclusion of a small number of D 3-branes in the resulting warped geometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable de Sitter ground state. The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is much greater than the cosmological time scale of 10 10 yr. We also prove, under certain conditions, that the lifetime of dS space in string theory will always be shorter than the recurrence time.",

We demonstrate that this mechanism is realizable in string theory, and give examples involving orientifold compactifications of type-IIB string theory and F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. In each case, the hierarchy of scales is fixed by a choice of Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz fluxes in the compact manifold. Our solutions involve compactifications of the Klebanov-Strassler gravity dual to a confining N= 1 supersymmetric gauge theory, and the hierarchy reflects the small scale of chiral symmetry breaking in the dual gauge theory.",

At first sight a warped compactification geometry seems to produce a naturally flat inflaton potential, evading one well known difficulty of brane\u2013antibrane scenarios. Careful consideration of the closed string moduli reveals a further obstacle: superpotential stabilization of the compactification volume typically modifies the inflaton potential and renders it too steep for inflation. We discuss the non-generic conditions under which this problem does not arise. We conclude that brane inflation models can only work if restrictive assumptions about the method of volume stabilization, the warping of the internal space, and the source of inflationary energy are satisfied. We argue that this may not be a real problem, given the large range of available fluxes and background geometries in string theory.",

We recover the perturbative gauge symmetry enhancements of the heterotic side and the physics of small SO(32) instantons, and discover new mixed perturbative\/nonperturbative gauge symmetry enhancements. Upon further toroidal compactification to four dimensions, we derive the chain of Calabi-Yau threefolds dual to various Coulomb branches of heterotic strings.",
