By using new, more accurate proper motions from PPM and Hipparcos and a few new radial velocities, we conclude that on kinematic grounds, most of the proposed members of the moving group are not, in fact, associated with \u03b2 Pic. However, two M dwarfs--or three, actually, since one of them is a nearly equal mass binary--have space motions that coincide with that of \u03b2 Pic to within 1 km s-1 with small error bars. Based on a color-magnitude diagram derived from accurate photometry and Hipparcos parallaxes, these two possible proper-motion companions to \u03b2 Pic are very young; we derive an age of~ 20 Myr by comparison with theoretical tracks from F. D'Antona & I. Mazzitelli. In fact, the proposed \u03b2 Pic companions \u2026",

These new observations substantially improve upon both the sensitivity and the spatial resolution for this region of the Pleiades, allowing us to detect 18 cluster members not detected before and 16 members not included in the catalogs used in previous surveys. The high sensitivity of the present observations permits us to obtain more stringent upper limits for 72 additional members and also provides sufficient numbers of stars to enable us to explore the dependence of L_x on stellar rotation for the slow rotators of the Pleiades. Using the new high sensitivity X-ray observations and the recent rotational measurements we discuss the activity-rotation relationship in the Pleiades solar type stars.

            "We report the discovery of large-amplitude, periodic X-ray emission from the O7 V star \u03b8 1 Orionis C, the central star of the Orion Nebula. Ten ROSAT HRI snapshots of the Trapezium cluster taken over the course of 21 days show that the count rate of \u03b8 1 Ori C varies from 0.26 to 0.41 counts s-1 with a clear 15 day period. The soft X-ray variations have the same phase and period as H\u03b1 and He II \u03bb4686 variations reported by Stahl et al. and are in antiphase with the C IV and Si IV ultraviolet absorption features. We consider five mechanisms which might explain the amplitude, phase, and periodicity of the X-ray variations:(1) colliding-wind emission with an unseen binary companion,(2) coronal emission from an unseen late-type pre-main-sequence star,(3) periodic density fluctuations,(4) absorption of magnetospheric X-rays in a corotating wind, and (5) magnetosphere eclipses. The ROSAT data rule out the first three \u2026",

With the exception of the very unusual pre\u2013main\u2010sequence star system HD 98800, all the late\u2010type Vega\u2010like stars are the same age as the Hyades cluster (600\u2013800 Myr) or older.",
