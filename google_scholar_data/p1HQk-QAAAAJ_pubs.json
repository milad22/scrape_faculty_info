            "While evidence of a topologically nontrivial surface state has been identified in surface-sensitive measurements of Bi 2 Se 3, a significant experimental concern is that no signatures have been observed in bulk transport. In a search for such states, nominally undoped single crystals of Bi 2 Se 3 with carrier densities approaching 10 16 cm\u2212 3 and very high mobilities exceeding 2 m 2 V\u2212 1 s\u2212 1 have been studied. A comprehensive analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, Hall effect, and optical reflectivity indicates that the measured electrical transport can be attributed solely to bulk states, even at 50 mK at low Landau-level filling factor, and in the quantum limit. The absence of a significant surface contribution to bulk conduction demonstrates that even in very clean samples, the surface mobility is lower than that of the bulk, despite its topological protection.",

However, direct evidence for the development of the Kondo coherent state and for the evolution of the electronic structure in the material has not been obtained due to the compound\u2019s rather complicated electronic and thermal transport behavior. Recently, these open questions have attracted increasing attention as the emergence of a time-reversal-invariant topological surface state in the Kondo insulator has been suggested. Here, we use point-contact spectroscopy to reveal the temperature dependence of the electronic states in SmB 6. We demonstrate that SmB 6 is a model Kondo insulator: Below 100 K, the conductance spectra reflect the Kondo hybridization of Sm ions, but, below about 30 K, signatures of inter-ion correlation effects clearly emerge. Moreover, we find evidence that the low-temperature insulating state of this \u2026",

In electron-doped copper oxides, the absence of an anomalous pseudogap phase in the underdoped region of the phase diagram 2 and weaker electron correlations 3, 4 suggest that Mott physics and other unidentified competing orders are less relevant and that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are the dominant feature.
