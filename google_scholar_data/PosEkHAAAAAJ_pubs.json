            "The pair distribution function (PDF) reveals directly in real space the interatomic distances in a material. Recent applications have proved the PDF technique to be a powerful local-structure probe of nanostructured materials (Egami & Billinge, 2003; Billinge & Kanatzidis, 2004), in addition to its traditional use to study liquids and glasses (Furukawa, 1962; Wright, 1998). The experimental PDF is obtained by a sine Fourier transformation of the total-scattering structure function S (Q), where Q is the magnitude of the scattering vector. To obtain S (Q) from raw scattering intensities, many corrections have to be made to account for various instrument and sample effects. Adding to this complexity, most existing X-ray data PDF analysis software is menu driven and not particularly user-friendly. Reproducing an earlier data analysis has been difficult because data processing parameters are usually kept in the notebook other \u2026",

Neutron powder diffraction data were collected and a combined Rietveld and high real space resolution atomic pair distribution function analysis was carried out. The nature of the Jahn-Teller (JT) transition around 750 K is confirmed to be orbital order to disorder. In the high-temperature orthorhombic (O) and rhombohedral (R) phases, the MnO 6 octahedra are still fully distorted locally. More importantly, the intermediate structure suggests the presence of local ordered clusters of diameter\u223c 16 \u00c5 (\u223c 4 MnO 6 octahedra) implying strong nearest-neighbor JT antiferrodistortive coupling.

The mixer exploits hydrodynamic focusing to create a thin jet containing the macromolecules of interest. Kinetic reactions are triggered by molecular diffusion into the jet from adjacent flow layers. The ultimate time resolution of these devices can be restricted by premature contact between co-flowing solutions during the focusing process. Here, we describe the design and characterization of a mixer in which hydrodynamic focusing is decoupled from the diffusion of reactants, so that the focusing region is free from undesirable contact between the reactants. Uniform mixing on the microsecond time scale is demonstrated using a device fabricated by imprinting optical-grade plastic. Device characterization is carried out using fluorescence correlation \u2026",

Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating attraction between short DNA strands mediated by Mg 2+ ions. Solution small angle x-ray scattering data collected as a function of DNA concentration enable model independent extraction of the second virial coefficient. As the [Mg 2+] increases, this coefficient turns from positive to negative reflecting the transition from repulsive to attractive inter-DNA interaction. This surprising observation is corroborated by independent light scattering experiments. The dependence of the observed attraction on experimental parameters including DNA length provides valuable clues to its origin.",

However, most previous studies of the electrostatics of nucleic acid duplexes have focused on DNA. Here, we present a comparative investigation of electrostatic effects in RNA and DNA. Using resonant (anomalous) and non-resonant small-angle X-ray scattering, we characterized the charge screening efficiency and counterion distribution around short (25 bp) dsDNA and RNA molecules of comparable sequence. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find counterion mediated screening to be more efficient for dsRNA than dsDNA. Furthermore, the topology of the RNA A-form helix alters the spatial distribution of counterions relative to B-form DNA. The experimental results \u2026",

            "Using solution synchrotron x-ray scattering, we measure the variation of DNA-DNA d spacings in bacteriophage \u03bb with mono-, di-, and polyvalent salt concentrations, for wild-type [48.5\u00d7 10 3 base pairs (bp)] and short-genome-mutant (37.8 kbp) strains. From the decrease in d spacings with increasing salt, we deduce the relative contributions of DNA self-repulsion and bending to the energetics of packaged phage genomes. We quantify the DNA-DNA interaction energies within the intact phage by combining the measured d spacings in the capsid with measurements of osmotic pressure in DNA assemblies under the same salt conditions in bulk solution. In the commonly used Tris-Mg buffer, the DNA-DNA interaction energies inside the phage capsids are shown to be about 1 k T\/bp, an order of magnitude larger than the bending energies.",
