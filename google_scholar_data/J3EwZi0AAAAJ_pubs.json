            "A promising electrocatalyst prototype of low Pt mole fraction, intermetallic nanoparticles of Cu3Pt, has been prepared using a simple impregnation-reduction method, followed by a post heat-treatment. Two dealloying methods (electrochemical and chemical) were implemented to control the atomic-level morphology and improve performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The morphology and elemental composition of the dealloyed nanoparticles were characterized at angstrom resolution using an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with an electron energy loss spectrometer. We found that the electrochemical dealloying method led to the formation of a thin Pt skin of ca. 1 nm in thickness with an ordered Cu3Pt core structure, while chemical leaching gave rise to a \u201cspongy\u201d structure with no ordered structure being preserved.

The origin of this 2-DEL, however, is highly debated, with focus on the role of defects in the SrTiO 3, while the LaAlO 3 has been assumed perfect. Here we demonstrate, through experiments and first-principle calculations, that the cation stoichiometry of the nominal LaAlO 3 layer is key to 2-DEL formation: only Al-rich LaAlO 3 results in a 2-DEL. Although extrinsic defects, including oxygen deficiency, are known to render LaAlO 3\/SrTiO 3 samples conducting, our results show that in the absence of such extrinsic defects an interface 2-DEL can form.

We found that aging of the catalysts under normal fuel cell operating conditions (potential scans from +0.6 to +1.0 V for 30\u2009000 cycles) gives rise to coarsening of the nanoparticles, mainly through coalescence, which in turn leads to the loss of performance.

These spectral maps are often dose-limited and spatially oversampled, leading to low counts\/channel and are thus highly sensitive to errors in background estimation. However, by taking advantage of redundancy in the dataset map one can improve background estimation and increase chemical sensitivity. We consider two such approaches-linear combination of power laws and local background averaging-that reduce background error and improve signal extraction. Principal components analysis (PCA) can also be used to analyze spectrum images, but the poor peak-to-background ratio in EELS can lead to serious artifacts if raw EELS data is PCA filtered. We identify common artifacts and discuss alternative approaches. These algorithms are implemented within the Cornell Spectrum Imager, an open source software package for spectroscopic analysis.",
