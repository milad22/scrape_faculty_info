            "We developed a method for inducing sexual outcrosses in the homothallic Ascomycete fungus Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusarium graminearum). Strains were marked with different nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutations, and vegetative compatibility groups served as additional markers in some crosses. Strains with complementary nit mutations were cocultured on carrot agar plates. Ascospores from individual perithecia were plated on a minimal medium (MM) containing nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Crosses between different nit mutants segregated in expected ratios (3:1 nit-:nit+) from heterozygous perithecia. Analysis of vegetative compatibility groups of progeny of two crosses indicated two and three vegetative incompatibility (vic) genes segregating, respectively. For rapid testing of sexual recombination between nit mutants, perithecia were inverted over MM to deposit actively discharged ascospores \u2026",

            "Leaf rust and stripe rust are important foliar diseases of wheat worldwide. Leaf rust and stripe rust resistant introgression lines were developed by induced homoeologous chromosome pairing between wheat chromosome 5D and 5Mg of Aegilops geniculata (UgMg). Characterization of rust resistant BC2F5 and BC3F6 homozygous progenies using genomic in situ hybridization with Aegilops comosa (M) DNA as probe identified three different types of introgressions; two cytologically visible and one invisible (termed cryptic alien introgression). All three types of introgression lines showed similar and complete resistance to the most prevalent pathotypes of leaf rust and stripe rust in Kansas (USA) and Punjab (India). Diagnostic polymorphisms between the alien segment and recipient parent were identified using physically mapped RFLP probes. Molecular mapping revealed that cryptic alien introgression \u2026",

Our objective in this study was to test the hypothesis that a homogeneous, randomly mating population of G. zeae is contiguous throughout the central and eastern United States across a span of several years. We analysed presence\/absence alleles based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) at 30 loci, 24 of which are defined genetically on a linkage map of G. zeae, from > 500 isolates in eight field populations from seven states collected during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 cropping seasons. All these strains had AFLP profiles similar to those of standard isolates of G. zeae phylogenetic lineage 7.

Selection for the nitrate-utilizing recombinant progeny can explain two of the three skewed regions.

            "Stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.) (the causal agent of wheat stem rust) race Ug99 (also designated TTKSK) and its derivatives have defeated several important stem rust resistance genes widely used in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, rendering much of the worldwide wheat acreage susceptible. In order to identify new resistance sources, a large collection of wheat relatives and genetic stocks maintained at the Wheat Genetic and Genomic Resources Center was screened. The results revealed that most accessions of the diploid relative Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy were highly resistant. The screening of a set of wheat\u2013D. villosum chromosome addition lines revealed that the wheat\u2013D. villosum disomic addition line DA6V#3 was moderately resistant to race Ug99. The objective of the present study was to produce and characterize compensating wheat\u2013D. villosum \u2026",

            "Young, visually symptomless leaves from potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants infected with Verticillium dahliae exhibited reduced carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO2, but no increase in dark respiration, no change in the relationship between carbon assimilation rate versus intercellular CO2, and no change in light use efficiency when intercellular CO2 was held constant. Therefore, the initial decrease in photosynthesis caused by V. dahliae was caused by stomatal closure. Errors in the intercellular CO2 calculation caused by uneven distribution of carbon assimilation rate across the leaf were tested by 14CO2 autoradiography. Patchiness was found at a low frequency. Low stomatal conductance was correlated with low leaf water potentials. Infection did not affect leaf osmotic potentials.",
