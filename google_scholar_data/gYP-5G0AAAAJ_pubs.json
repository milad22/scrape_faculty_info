Here, we document a standardized technique applied to the UVIS-HSP ring occultation datasets delivered to the Planetary Data System as higher level data products. These observations provide measurements of ring structure that approaches the scale of the largest common ring particles (~ 5 m). The combination of multiple occultations at different viewing geometries enables reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure of the rings. This inversion of the occultation data depends on accurate calibration of the data so that occultations of different stars taken at different times and under different viewing conditions can be combined to retrieve ring structure. We provide examples of the structure of the rings as seen from several \u2026",

            "UVIS occultation data show clumping in Saturn\u2019s F ring and at the B ring outer edge, indicating aggregation and disaggregation at these locations that are perturbed by Prometheus and by Mimas. The inferred timescales range from hours to months. Occultation profiles of the edge show wide variability, indicating perturbations by local mass aggregations. Structure near the B ring edge is seen in power spectral analysis at scales 200\u20132000 m. Similar structure is also seen at the strongest density waves, with significance increasing with resonance strength. For the B ring outer edge, the strongest structure is seen at longitudes 90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0 relative to Mimas. This indicates a direct relation between the moon and the ring clumping. We propose that the collective behavior of the ring particles resembles a predator\u2013prey system: the mean aggregate size is the prey, which feeds the velocity dispersion; conversely \u2026",

Though it is well known that differential optical depths provide a way to probe the parameters of size distribution (i.e. Zebker et al. [1985] Icarus, 64, 531\u2013548), the technique is complicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes which introduce a geometric dependence to the observed optical depth. Here we present a method of extracting information about the size distribution of the particles in the gaps between the self-gravity wakes. The Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) occultations measure starlight at an effective wavelength of 2.9 \u00b5m falling onto a single pixel with angular dimensions 0.25 mrad \u00d7 0.5 mrad while Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) occultations measure starlight at a much smaller effective wavelength of 0.15 \u00b5m and over a field of view with larger angular \u2026",

Combining occultations has also revealed the structure of weak density waves in the Cassini Division [3] and B ring.

We analyze the edges of the Huygens and Titan Ringlets and the Encke Gap in the UVIS stellar occultation data to extract information on vertical and radial structure. Using a simple model for the vertical and radial distribution of ring material, we are able to fit the majority of the light curves for these edges.
