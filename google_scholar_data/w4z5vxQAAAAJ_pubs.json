Using a particular quasiparticle basis of the Hilbert space dictated by integrability, we here compute explicitly the exact I (V) characteristic and conductance out of equilibrium as a function of driving voltage V and temperature T. These are described by universal scaling functions of two variables, the scaled point-contact interaction strength, and V\/T. The differential-conductance curve as a function of the interaction strength broadens significantly as V\/T is increased, and develops a pronounced maximum at a (universal) critical value (eV\/k B T)= 7.188 68....

It presents a number of interesting features including non-compactness, non-simplicity, 1\/k2 quantum corrections, and logarithms in the current blocks. We compute the four-point functions, determine the scalar product of current blocks and make contact with the Uqgl(1, 1) quantum group. We then discuss the gl(1,1) Chern-Simons model and recover the eight relations that uniquely determine \u0394, as shown recently by Murakami. We discuss also how \u0394 can be computed by link surgery. The analysis runs into some difficulties due to the facts that \u0394 is zero in the braid group approach unless a strand is open, and that \u0394 vanishes for a split link. We propose some formal solutions to these. In appendices we give the full set of Uqgl(1, 1) 6j coefficients, we deal with \u2026",

            "We present a simple model of earthquakes on a pre-existing hierarchical fault structure. The system self-organizes at large times in a stationary state with a power law Gutenberg-Richter distribution of earthquake sizes. The largest fault carries irregular great earthquakes preceded by precursors developing over long time scales and followed by aftershocks obeying an Omori's law. The cumulative energy released by precursors follows a time-to-failure power law with log-periodic structures, qualifying a large event as an effective dynamical (depinning) critical point. Down the hierarchy, smaller earthquakes exhibit the same phenomenology, albeit with increasing irregularities.",

In the latter case the expansion on characters of the Virasoro algebra involves real coefficients of either sign. The operator content of both models is discussed in detail.",

In the scalar case, this is done by introducing a new \u201cR-channel TBA\u201d, where the boundary is represented by a boundary state, and the thermodynamics involves evaluating scalar products of boundary states with all the states of the theory. In the non-scalar, sine-Gordon case, this is done by generalizing the method of Destri and De Vega. The two approaches are compared. Miscellaneous other results are obtained, in particular formulas for the overall normalization and scalar products of boundary states, exact partition functions for the critical Ising model in a boundary magnetic field, and also results for the energy, excited states and boundary S-matrix of O(n) and minimal models.",
