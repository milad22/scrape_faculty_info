            "Metasurfaces control light propagation at the nanoscale for applications in both free-space and surface-confined geometries. However, dynamically changing the properties of metasurfaces can be a major challenge. Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable hyperbolic metasurface comprised of a heterostructure of isotopically enriched hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in direct contact with the phase-change material (PCM) single-crystal vanadium dioxide (VO 2). Metallic and dielectric domains in VO 2 provide spatially localized changes in the local dielectric environment, enabling launching, reflection, and transmission of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) at the PCM domain boundaries, and tuning the wavelength of HPhPs propagating in hBN over these domains by a factor of 1.6. We show that this system supports in-plane HPhP refraction, thus providing a prototype for a class of planar refractive optics. This \u2026",

            "Black phosphorus (BP) possesses several extraordinary physical properties, which include in-plane anisotropy, thickness dependent direct bandgap and high carrier mobility. These physical properties make BP highly desirable from the point of view of fundamental science and modern optoelectronics applications. The excitement about this material has always been accompanied by unreserved skepticism due to its extraordinary degradation under ambient conditions. Here we show ambient degradation of exfoliated BP can be effectively suppressed using thin layer of hybrid metal organic chemical vapor deposition coating of boron nitride (BN) followed by atomic layer deposition coating of Al 2 O 3. We have extensively studied the time dependent surface, optical and electrical properties of BP encapsulated by BN and\/or Al 2 O 3 using nanoscale infrared imaging and I\u2013V characterizations.

            "Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are generated when infrared photons couple to polar optic phonons in anisotropic media, confining long-wavelength light to nanoscale volumes. However, to realize the full potential of HPhPs for infrared optics, it is crucial to understand propagation and loss mechanisms on substrates suitable for applications from waveguiding to infrared sensing. We employ scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and nano-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in concert with analytical and numerical calculations, to elucidate HPhP characteristics as a function of the complex substrate dielectric function. We consider propagation on suspended, dielectric and metallic substrates to demonstrate that the thickness-normalized wavevector can be reduced by a factor of 25 simply by changing the substrate from dielectric to metallic behavior.

Self-assembled quantum-dot lasers are studied considering the homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening of the optical gain, as well as the nonlinear gain and thermal carrier escape from quantum dots. For different carrier relaxation times, the current-output power characteristics and light emissions of the quantum-dot laser have been calculated. The effect of the coverage factor is studied, and an optimized value is introduced for each carrier relaxation time.

We describe the technical implementations that enabled this achievement and demonstrate its performance with a heterogeneously doped Si semiconductor sample. Specifically, we recorded a hyperspectral image of 40 by 20 pixels in 180 minutes and with a spatial resolution of about ~170 nm by measuring at each pixel with a time domain spectrum covering the range from 0.4 to 1.8 THz.
