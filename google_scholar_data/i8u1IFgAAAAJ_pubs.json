Trial spin liquid wave functions are obtained by Gutzwiller projection of fermionic mean-field states and their energetics is compared against magnetically ordered trial states. We find that in a range of the ring exchange coupling upon destroying the antiferromagnetic order, the best such spin liquid state is essentially a Gutzwiller-projected Fermi sea state. We propose this spin liquid with a spinon Fermi surface as a candidate for the nonmagnetic insulating phase observed in the organic compound \u03ba\u2212(ET) 2 Cu 2 (CN) 3, and describe some experimental consequences of this proposal.",

Hence, this is an explicit realization of fractionalization in a model with global SU (2) symmetry. The zero-temperature ordering transition from this phase is found to be continuous but distinct from the regular Heisenberg ordering transition.

            "We consider orbital magnetic field effects in a spin liquid phase of a half-filled triangular lattice Hubbard system close to the Mott transition, continuing an earlier exploration of a state with spinon Fermi surface. Starting from the Hubbard model and focusing on the insulator side, we derive an effective spin Hamiltonian up to four-spin exchanges in the presence of magnetic field, and find that the magnetic field couples linearly to spin chirality on the triangles. The latter corresponds to a flux of an internal gauge field in a gauge theory description of the spin liquid, and therefore a static internal flux is induced. A quantitative estimate of the effect is obtained using a spinon mean-field analysis, where we find that this orbital field experienced by the spinons is comparable to or even larger than the applied field. We further argue that because the stiffness of the emergent internal gauge field is very small, such a spinon-gauge \u2026",
