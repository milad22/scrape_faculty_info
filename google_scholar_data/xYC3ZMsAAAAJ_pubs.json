            "Synthetic photonic materials are an emerging platform for exploring the interface between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic material properties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Photons experiencing a Lorentz force develop handedness, providing opportunities to study quantum Hall physics and topological quantum science 6, 7, 8. Here we present an experimental realization of a magnetic field for continuum photons. We trap optical photons in a multimode ring resonator to make a two-dimensional gas of massive bosons, and then employ a non-planar geometry to induce an image rotation on each round-trip 9. This results in photonic Coriolis\/Lorentz and centrifugal forces and so realizes the Fock\u2013Darwin Hamiltonian for photons in a magnetic field and harmonic trap 10. Using spatial-and energy-resolved spectroscopy, we track the resulting photonic eigenstates as radial trapping is reduced, finally observing a \u2026",

            "Polaritons are promising constituents of both synthetic quantum matter 1 and quantum information processors 2, whose properties emerge from their components: from light, polaritons draw fast dynamics and ease of transport; from matter, they inherit the ability to collide with one another. Cavity polaritons are particularly promising as they may be confined and subjected to synthetic magnetic fields controlled by cavity geometry 3, and furthermore they benefit from increased robustness due to the cavity enhancement in light\u2013matter coupling. Nonetheless, until now, cavity polaritons have operated only in a weakly interacting mean-field regime 4, 5. Here we demonstrate strong interactions between individual cavity polaritons enabled by employing highly excited Rydberg atoms as the matter component of the polaritons. We assemble a quantum dot composed of approximately 150 strongly interacting Rydberg-dressed \u2026",

Free-space Rydberg polaritons have recently drawn intense interest as tools for quantum information processing and few-body quantum science. Here, we explore the properties of their cavity counterparts in the single-particle sector, observing an enhanced lifetime and slowed dynamics characteristic of cavity dark polaritons. We measure the range of cavity frequencies over which the polaritons persist, corresponding to the spectral width available for polariton quantum dynamics, and the speed limit for quantum information processing. Further, we observe a cavity-induced suppression of inhomogeneous broadening channels and demonstrate the formation of Rydberg polaritons in a multimode cavity \u2026",

Whereas many such states are fully characterized by symmetries 2, interacting quantum systems can exhibit topological order and are instead characterized by intricate patterns of entanglement 3, 4. A paradigmatic example of topological order is the Laughlin state 5, which minimizes the interaction energy of charged particles in a magnetic field and underlies the fractional quantum Hall effect 6. Efforts have been made to enhance our understanding of topological order by forming Laughlin states in synthetic systems of ultracold atoms 7, 8 or photons 9, 10, 11.

Additionally, our ring cavity design can achieve arbitrary transverse-mode spacing simultaneously with the large mode-waist reductions. Following these principles, we build a parabolic atom-ring cavity system that achieves strong collective coupling NC= 15 (1) between N= 10 3 Rb atoms and a ring cavity with a single-atom cooperativity C that is significantly larger than what could be achieved with a near-confocal two-mirror cavity with the same mirror separation and finesse.
