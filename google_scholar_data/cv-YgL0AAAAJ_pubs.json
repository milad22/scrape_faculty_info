            "Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and\/or \u2026",

This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions.

The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles.

To elucidate synaptic mechanisms of decision making, I investigated a biophysically realistic cortical network model for a visual discrimination experiment. In the model, slow recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition produce attractor dynamics that amplify the difference between conflicting inputs and generates a binary choice. The model is shown to account for salient characteristics of the observed decision-correlated neural activity, as well as the animal's psychometric function and reaction times. These results suggest that recurrent excitation mediated by NMDA receptors provides a candidate cellular mechanism for the slow time integration of sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choices in a decision-making neocortical network.",

To elucidate the cellular and circuit basis of such integration times, we developed and investigated a simplified two-variable version of a biophysically realistic cortical network model of decision making. In this model, slow time integration can be achieved robustly if excitatory reverberation is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors; our model with only fast AMPA receptors at recurrent synapses produces decision times that are not comparable with experimental observations.

            "When the local field potential of a cortical network displays coherent fast  oscillations (\u223c40-Hz gamma or \u223c200-Hz sharp-wave ripples), the spike  trains of constituent neurons are typically irregular and sparse. The  dichotomy between rhythmic local field and stochastic spike trains presents a  challenge to the theory of brain rhythms in the framework of coupled  oscillators. Previous studies have shown that when noise is large and  recurrent inhibition is strong, a coherent network rhythm can be generated  while single neurons fire intermittently at low rates compared to the  frequency of the oscillation. However, these studies used too simplified  synaptic kinetics to allow quantitative predictions of the population rhythmic  frequency. Here we show how to derive quantitatively the coherent oscillation  frequency for a randomly connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons  with realistic synaptic parameters. In a \u2026",
