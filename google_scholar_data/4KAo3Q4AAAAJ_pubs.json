            "The design, construction, operation, and performance of a spin polarized electron source utilizing photoemission from negative electron affinity (NEA) GaAs are presented in detail. A polarization of 43\u00b12% is produced using NEA GaAs (100). The polarization can be easily modulated without affecting other characteristics of the electron beam. The electron beam intensity depends on the intensity of the exciting radiation at 1.6 eV; beam currents of 20 \u03bcA\/mW are obtained. The source is electron optically bright; the emittance phase space (energy\u2010area\u2010solid angle product) is 0.043 eV mm2 sr. The light optics, electron optics, and cathode preparation including the GaAs cleaning and activation to NEA are discussed in depth. The origin of the spin polarization in the photoexcitation process is reviewed and new equations describing the depolarization of photoelectrons in the emission process are derived.

Very often surfaces are created under non-equilibrium conditions such that the morphology is not always smooth. In addition to a detailed description of the characteristics of random rough surfaces, Experimental Methods in the Physical Sciences, Volume 37, Characterization of Amorphous and Crystalline Rough Surface-Principles and Applications will focus on the basic principles of real and diffraction techniques for quantitative characterization of the rough surfaces. The book thus includes the latest development on the characterization and measurements of a wide variety of rough surfaces. The complementary nature of the real space and diffraction techniques is fully displayed. Key Features* An accessible description of quantitative characterization of random rough surfaces and growth\/etch fronts* A detailed description of the principles, experimentation, and limitations of advanced real-space imaging techniques (such as atomic force microscopy) and diffraction techniques (such as light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and electron diffraction)* Characterization of a variety of rough surfaces (eg, self-affine, mounded, anisotropic, and two-level surfaces) accompanied by quantitative examples to illustrate the essence of the principles* An insightful description of how rough surfaces are formed* Presentation of the most recent examples of the applications of rough surfaces in various areas",

The sheet resistance R (\u03a9\/\u25a1), was measured in situ at different film thicknesses by a collinear four-point probe. The infinite R at d<10 nm suggested that the film consisted of discontinuous islands at these thicknesses. The R-value dropped rapidly by more than an order of magnitude when the thickness was increased from 10 to 15 nm, indicating the coalescence of islands. Further increases in d resulted in the R value gradually leveling off at 0.65\u00b10.01 \u03a9\/\u25a1, corresponding to a resistivity \u03c1 of 2.67 \u03bc\u03a9 cm at d\u223c41 nm.
