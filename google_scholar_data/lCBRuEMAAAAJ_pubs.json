            "Bimetallic platinum-nickel (Pt-Ni) nanostructures represent an emerging class of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells, but practical applications have been limited by catalytic activity and durability. We surface-doped Pt3Ni octahedra supported on carbon with transition metals, termed M\u2010Pt3Ni\/C, where M is vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, molybdenum (Mo), tungsten, or rhenium. The Mo\u2010Pt3Ni\/C showed the best ORR performance, with a specific activity of 10.3 mA\/cm2 and mass activity of 6.98 A\/mgPt, which are 81- and 73\u2010fold enhancements compared with the commercial Pt\/C catalyst (0.127 mA\/cm2 and 0.096 A\/mgPt). Theoretical calculations suggest that Mo prefers subsurface positions near the particle edges in vacuum and surface vertex\/edge sites in oxidizing conditions, where it enhances both the performance and the stability of the Pt3Ni catalyst.",

            "Most of recent research on layered chalcogenides is understandably focused on single atomic layers. However, it is unclear if single-layer units are the most ideal structures for enhanced gas\u2013solid interactions. To probe this issue further, we have prepared large-area MoS2 sheets ranging from single to multiple layers on 300 nm SiO2\/Si substrates using the micromechanical exfoliation method. The thickness and layering of the sheets were identified by optical microscope, invoking recently reported specific optical color contrast, and further confirmed by AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The MoS2 transistors with different thicknesses were assessed for gas-sensing performances with exposure to NO2, NH3, and humidity in different conditions such as gate bias and light irradiation. The results show that, compared to the single-layer counterpart, transistors of few MoS2 layers exhibit excellent sensitivity, recovery, and \u2026",

For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphene\/boron nitride moir\u00e9 superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moir\u00e9 superlattices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

An attractive insulating substrate or mate for MoS2 (and related materials such as graphene) is hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Stacked heterostructures of MoS2 and h-BN have been produced by manual transfer methods, but a more efficient and scalable assembly method is needed. Here we demonstrate the direct growth of single- and few-layer MoS2 on h-BN by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, which is scalable with suitably structured substrates. The growth mechanisms for single-layer and few-layer samples are found to be distinct, and for single-layer samples low relative rotation angles (<5\u00b0) between the MoS2 and h-BN lattices prevail. Moreover, MoS2 directly grown on h-BN maintains its intrinsic 1.89 eV bandgap. Our CVD \u2026",

Recently, a large number of reports have described graphene aerogels based on the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). Though these GO-based aerogels represent a considerable advance relative to traditional carbon aerogels, they remain significantly inferior to individual graphene sheets due to their poor crystallinity. Here, we report a straightforward method to synthesize highly crystalline GO-based graphene aerogels via high-temperature processing common in commercial graphite production.
