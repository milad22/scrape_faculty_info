Findings from relevant theoretical\/simulation and experimental literature published from 2004 onward are reviewed. Additional complexity arising from the heterogeneity of local environments in biological media, and the presence of nonspecific interactions between macromolecules over and above steric repulsion, are discussed. Theoretical and experimental approaches to the characterization of crowding- and confinement-induced effects in systems approaching the complexity of living organisms are suggested.",

This paper reviews physics-based models of binding, beginning with a summary of the changes in potential energy, solvation energy, and configurational entropy that influence affinity, and a theoretical overview to frame the discussion of specific computational approaches. Important advances are reported in modeling protein-ligand energetics, such as the incorporation of electronic polarization and the use of quantum mechanical methods. Recent calculations suggest that changes in configurational entropy strongly oppose binding and must be included if accurate affinities are to be obtained. The linear interaction energy (LIE) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods are analyzed, as are free energy pathway methods \u2026",

However, little is known at the atomic level about the heart of the functional mechanism for this tetrameric protein, a His37-Trp41 cluster. We report the structure of the M2 conductance domain (residues 22 to 62) in a lipid bilayer, which displays the defining features of the native protein that have not been attainable from structures solubilized by detergents. We propose that the tetrameric His37-Trp41 cluster guides protons through the channel by forming and breaking hydrogen bonds between adjacent pairs of histidines and through specific interactions of the histidines with the tryptophan gate. This mechanism explains the main observations on M2 proton conductance.",

Examples of such spaces might include the pores within chromatography columns, the Anfinsen cage in chaperonins, the interiors of ribosomes, or regions of steric occlusion inside cells. Confinement eliminates some expanded configurations of the unfolded chain, shifting the equilibrium from the unfolded state toward the native state. The partition coefficient for a protein in a confined space is predicted to decrease significantly when the solvent is changed from native to denaturing conditions. Small cages are predicted to increase the stability of the native state by as much as 15 kcal\/mol. Confinement may also increase the rates of protein or RNA folding. ",

In the present study the molecular dynamics trajectory is used to quantitatively analyze the effect of the gate on the substrate binding rate constant. For a 2.4-\u00c5 probe modeling acetylcholine, the gate is open only 2.4% of the time, but the quantitative analysis reveals that the substrate binding rate is slowed by merely a factor of 2. We rationalize this result by noting that the substrate, by virtue of Brownian motion, will make repeated attempts to enter the gate each time it is near the gate. If the gate is rapidly switching between the open and closed states, one of these attempts will coincide with an open state, and then \u2026",

            "The presence and location of water of hydration (that is, bound water) in the solution structure of human interleukin-1 beta (hIL-1 beta) was investigated with water-selective two-dimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It is shown here that in addition to water at the surface of the protein and ordered internal water molecules involved in bridging hydrogen bonds, positionally disordered water is present within a large, naturally occurring hydrophobic cavity located at the center of the molecule. These water molecules of hydration have residency times in the range of 1 to 2 nanoseconds to 100 to 200 microseconds and can be readily detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Thus, large hydrophobic cavities in proteins may not be truly empty, as analysis of crystal structures appears to show, but may contain mobile water molecules that are crystallographically invisible but detectable by NMR.",
