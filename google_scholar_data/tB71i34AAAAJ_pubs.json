            "Reducing vehicle weight is an important approach for increasing fuel economy, addressing regulatory requirements, and meeting consumer needs. Magnesium alloys are among the lightest structural metals and offer tremendous weight saving potential; however, many technical and commercial barriers limit their use in today's cars and trucks. Following a brief review of historical trends in vehicle weight and automotive magnesium, we describe key barriers to wider adoption of magnesium in high-volume vehicle applications. A discussion of manufacturing and processing, in-service performance, and cost requirements identifies specific development needs and opportunities while framing promising paths forward.",

These transformations are not fully understood and increased understanding of these mechanisms will permit future development of improved alloys for aerospace, biomedical, and energy applications.

Traditionally, twinning has been described as a shear process that can occur almost instantaneously; however, the twinning deformation mechanisms in titanium alloys can be controlled by the diffusion of oxygen away from annihilated interstitial sites at the twin boundaries. The most recent studies which include the strain-rate effects on twinning support the hypothesis that twinning in these materials is controlled by a slow diffusion process rather than a quick shear process. The effects of strain-rate on twinning in a \u03b1-Ti\u20131.6V alloy were systematically investigated by means of optical and transmission electron microscopy and a diffusion-based model has been applied which explains the unexpected twin sizes observed at different strain rates.",

However, the mechanisms for twin nucleation, growth, and interaction with other defects are not completely understood. In this study we interrogate the behavior of oxygen (O) interstitials near a (10 1\u00af 2) twin boundary using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and modified embedded atom method (MEAM) calculations. The presence of the twin boundary significantly affects both interstitial formation energy as well as the activation barriers for diffusion between sites. We demonstrate that a tetrahedral interstitial is stable in the twin boundary, despite being unstable in bulk Ti, while the formation energies of the octahedral, hexahedral, and crowdion interstitials are all modified by a nearby twin. Further, the activation barriers for diffusion in the region near the twin are uniformly lower \u2026",

Compared to conventional automotive materials, magnesium alloys can reduce the weight of structural components and Systems by more than 50%. Vehicle fuel economy improves by 6-8% for every 10% reduction in weight [1], thus the significant potential for weight savings makes magnesium alloys an attractive technology to support improved efficiency in our cars and trucks. However, magnesium alloys for use in commercial and passenger vehicles face a variety of technical challenges [2][3]. The maturity of magnesium alloys will be discussed in three main categories:(1) properties and manufacturability of alloys that meet automotive performance and cost requirements on a partby-part basis,(2) joining and multi-material enabling technologies that support integration of magnesium components into structural Systems, and (3) modeling and simulation of magnesium alloys and processes that allow rapid development and compatibility with existing, computationally-intensive vehicle design techniques.Exceeding the properties and manufacturability requirements for automotive components is critical for implementation of magnesium alloys. Broadly speaking, the high cost of producing magnesium components with adequate properties limits applications of Mg to less than 0.5% of the weight of an average vehicle [4]; however, the scientific and manufacturing drivers for high cost vary by alloy and manufacturing process.
