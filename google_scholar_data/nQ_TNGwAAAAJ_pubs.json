            "Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II), SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations. This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Ly\u03b1 forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of large-scale structure to obtain percent \u2026",

            "Comprehensive wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys of the sky have played a key role in astronomy, leading to fundamental new breakthroughs in our understanding of the Solar System; our Milky Way Galaxy and its constituent stars and gas; the nature, properties, and evolution of galaxies; and the universe as a whole. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which started routine operations in 2000 April, has carried out imaging and spectroscopy over roughly 1\/3 of the Celestial Sphere. SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5 m wide-field telescope (Gunn et al. 2006), instrumented with a sequence of sophisticated imagers and spectrographs. The SDSS has gone through a series of stages. SDSS-I (York et al. 2000), which was in operation through 2005, focused on a \u201cLegacy\u201d survey of five-band imaging (using what was at the time the largest camera ever used in optical astronomy; Gunn et al. 1998) and \u2026",

It uses a dedicated wide-field 2.5 m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) at Apache Point Observatory (APO) in the Sacramento Mountains in Southern New Mexico. It was originally instrumented with a wide-field imaging camera with an effective area of 1.5 deg2 (Gunn et al. 1998), and a pair of double spectrographs fed by 640 fibers (Smee et al. 2013). The initial survey (York et al. 2000) carried out imaging in five broad bands (ugriz)(Fukugita et al. 1996) to a depth of r\u223c 22. 5 mag over 11,663 deg2 of high-latitude sky, and spectroscopy of 1.6 million galaxy, quasar, and stellar targets over 9380 deg2. The resulting images were calibrated astrometrically (Pier et al. 2003) and photometrically (Ivezic et al. 2004; Tucker et al. 2006; Padmanabhan et al. 2008), and the properties of the detected objects were measured (Lupton et al. 2001 \u2026",

            "The Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) provides the most comprehensive data set ever acquired on the X\u2010ray emission of pre\u2013main\u2010sequence stars. In this paper, we study the nearly 600 X\u2010ray sources that can be reliably identified with optically well\u2010characterized T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster. With a detection limit of   ergs s\u22121 for lightly absorbed sources, we detect X\u2010ray emission from more than 97% of the optically visible late\u2010type (spectral types F\u2013M) cluster stars. This proves that there is no \u201cX\u2010ray\u2013quiet\u201d population of late\u2010type stars with suppressed magnetic activity. We use this exceptional optical, infrared, and X\u2010ray data set to study the dependencies of the X\u2010ray properties on other stellar parameters. All TTSs with known rotation periods lie in the saturated or supersaturated regime of the relation between activity and Rossby numbers seen for main\u2010sequence (MS) stars, but the \u2026",

We show that these stars are likely members of the young (~ 10 6 yr) Orion OBIc\/d association. The rotation period distribution we determine, which is sensitive to periods 0.1< P< 8 days, shows a sharp cutoff for periods P< 0.5 days, corresponding to breakup velocity for these stars. Above 0.5 days the distribution is consistent with a uniform distribution; we do not find evidence for a\" gap\" of periods at 4\u20135 days. We find signatures of active accretion among stars at all periods; active accretion does not occur preferentially among slow rotators in our sample. We find no correlation between rotation period and near-IR signatures of circumstellar disks. In addition, we show that the distribution of v sin i among stars in our sample bears striking resemblance to that of low-mass Pleiades stars. We discuss the implications of our findings \u2026",

Even the most fundamental physical properties of brown dwarfs remain, however, largely unconstrained by direct measurement. Here we report the discovery of a brown-dwarf eclipsing binary system, in the Orion Nebula star-forming region, from which we obtain direct measurements of mass and radius for these newly formed brown dwarfs. Our mass measurements establish both objects as brown dwarfs, with masses of 0.054\u00b10.005M\u2299 and 0.034\u00b10.003M\u2299. At the same time, with radii relative to the Sun's of 0.669\u00b10.034R\u2299 and 0.511\u00b10.026R\u2299, these brown dwarfs are more akin to low-mass stars in size. Such \u2026",
