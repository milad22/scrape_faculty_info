            "Electrons moving through a spatially periodic lattice potential develop a quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum 1. Known as Hofstadter\u2019s butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and is one of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with periodicities of less than one nanometre \u2026",

A peak at \u223c1860 cm\u22121 (iTALO\u2212) is observed due to a combination of the in-plane transverse acoustic (iTA) and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The intensity of this peak decreases with increasing number of layers and this peak is absent for bulk graphite. The overtone of the out-of-plane transverse optical (oTO) phonon at \u223c1750 cm\u22121, also called the M band, is suppressed for both SLG and IBLG. In addition, two previously unidentified modes at \u223c2200 and \u223c1880 cm\u22121 are observed in SLG. The 2220 cm\u22121 (1880 cm\u22121) mode is tentatively assigned to the combination mode of in-plane transverse optical (iTO) and TA phonons (oTO+LO phonons) around the K point in the graphene Brillouin zone.

Here we perform atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate peptide-binding behavior to graphene and graphite. We studied a dodecamer peptide identified with phage display to possess affinity for graphite. Optical spectroscopy reveals that the peptide forms secondary structures both in powder form and in an aqueous medium. The dominant structure in the powder form is \u03b1-helix, which undergoes a transition to a distorted helical structure in aqueous solution. The peptide forms a complex reticular structure upon adsorption on graphene and graphite, having a helical conformation different from \u03b1-helix due to its interaction with the surface.

Combining single-layer TMDs with other 2D materials in van der Waals heterostructures offers an intriguing means of controlling the electronic properties through these many-body effects, by means of engineered interlayer interactions 8, 9, 10. Here, we use micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) and in situ surface doping to manipulate the electronic structure of single-layer WS 2 on hexagonal boron nitride (WS 2\/h-BN). Upon electron doping, we observe an unexpected giant renormalization of the spin\u2013orbit splitting of the single-layer WS 2 \u2026",

Here, we present the experimental study showing the strong modulation of spin currents in graphene layers by controlling the direction of the exchange field due to FMI magnetization. Owing to clean interfaces, a strong magnetic exchange coupling leads to the experimental observation of complete spin modulation at low externally applied magnetic fields in short graphene channels. Additionally, we discover that the graphene spin current can be fully dephased by randomly fluctuating exchange fields. This is \u2026",

Our results are compatible with hydrogen adsorbates inducing intervalley mixing by exerting a short-range scattering potential. The saturation coverages for different devices are found to be proportional to their initial mobility, indicating that the number of native scatterers is proportional to the saturation coverage of hydrogen. By extrapolating this proportionality, we show that the field-effect mobility can reach 1.5\u00d7 10 4 cm 2\/V s in the absence of the hydrogen-adsorbing sites.

While h-BN is expected to be favorable for spin injection, previous experimental studies have been unable to achieve spin relaxation times in the nanosecond regime, suggesting potential problems originating from the contacts. Here, we investigate spin relaxation in graphene spin valves with h-BN barriers and observe room temperature spin lifetimes in excess of a nanosecond, which provides experimental confirmation that h-BN is indeed a good barrier material for spin injection into graphene. By carrying out measurements with different thicknesses of h-BN, we show that few layer h-BN is a better choice than monolayer for achieving high non-local spin signals and longer spin relaxation times in graphene.",
