Through the specification of the Alternating Bit Protocol using a set of communicating X-machines, the advantages of the technique, in particular its data modelling and its modular approach to design, are highlighted.",

            "This research investigates the development of interpretation design in Australia during the period 1980 \u2013 2006, and its role in presenting natural and cultural heritage to audiences in visitor settings. It establishes Australian interpretation design at the intersection of two professional fields, interpretation and design. Where heritage interpretation originates from a background of spoken language, through narrative and storytelling, graphic and communication design have origins in visual language, communicated through images and text. This research positions interpretation design as a new field within design and traces its emergence as a hybrid of spoken and visual traditions of communication.The study gives visibility to this previously undocumented and un-theorised hybrid field of design and creates a thematic conceptual framework within which to locate its historical, conceptual and practical origins. In substantiating interpretation design as a new field, three avenues of enquiry were considered; documentation and analysis of the visual artefacts of interpretation design, locating interpretation design in a wider conceptual and professional context through literature reviews, and consultation with designers in order to understand the challenges and problems in this new mode of design. Further, to facilitate designers to continue to work effectively in highly collaborative, complex and cross-disciplinary professional environments a conceptual collaborative tool was developed for use by interpretation design project teams. The conceptual tool integrates the theoretical and practical findings from this research and is based on a pattern language \u2026",

            "The practice of communication design gives visual form to the interpretation or presentation of a place to tourists and visitors. Research shows that interpretation can lead visitors to develop an appreciation towards a place, through gaining knowledge, understanding and empathy for that place (Stewart et al 1998). The communication of information and ideas through interpretation is critical in fostering a positive attitude of stewardship and protection towards a place, which can also lead to sustainability of the environment and the host community (Moscardo 1999).",

            "Typotastic is a design journal published by the Visual Communication Studio at the Tasmanian School of Art, University of Tasmania, as part of the curriculum for third year graphic design students. Typotastic is an award winning, unique collaboration between design educators, students, industry professionals and commentators, working together to produce Australia's first publication dedicated solely to the critical writing and exploration of typography. The project represents an innovative pedagogical model combining collaborative design practice and a real-world project. Through Typotastic students publish an international design journal, collaborating both on content and design. Lecturers take the roles of editor and creative director, guiding the publication through to finished printed outcome. Typotastic also generates research, conceptual frameworks, written and visual content and contact with scholarly networks. Typotastic is not a seamless design project; instead it is vulnerable to the usual compromises, timelines and budget pressures of any normal publication. Students are exposed to a high level of professional practice experience and learn what it takes to create a publication from initial vision through to finished work. This paper presents the project Typotastic as an example of innovative teaching through collaboration, and argues that many of the strengths of the project come from its high-risk and collaborative nature.",

The author\u2019s research, based on interviews with graphic designers involved in interpretation projects, will underpin this paper. By focusing on the contribution of designers to interpretation projects, the author will highlight possibilities for the design profession to contribute to the field of interpretation.

These guidelines use a design perspective to achieve quality communication experiences in interpretive settings\u201cThe very concept of interpretation is challenging.

It's hard to strike the right tone, and select the right information to give them. I think it's a great privilege to work on these jobs: the work has lasting worth (we hope), and in that sense is less ephemeral than much of the work that graphic designers do.\u201d Julie Hawkins1",

            "This chapter is concerned with creativity in inland Australia and pays close attention to creative and innovative activity generated in regional and non-metropolitan settings. We argue that while the discourse about creative industries has been focused on global metropolitan cities, creativity (present but less visible) in regional and agriculturally dependent communities can be re-framed. To do this, we look at the scope and scale of the inland from the footprint of Charles Sturt University in regional New South Wales. Then, we refine our focus using the lens of the portmanteau word \u2018agri-tivity\u2019, which we have coined to describe the interface between creativity and innovation, markets, technologically advanced forms of production and high-value services in regional settings. Historically, some of the strongest evocations of creativity and ingenuity in the national imagination have originated from inland Australia and its communities. Charles Sturt University\u2019s footprint is an inland one; the majority of its campuses are located in inland regional communities in the state of New South Wales, covering an area of approximately 800,000 square kilometres. This inland regional setting corresponds with and holds traces of the most celebrated (and contested) sites and characters of Australia\u2019s creative and cultural heritage. The Wiradjuri people, whose land the Charles Sturt campuses are built on, have occupied the land for many tens of thousands of years. Since European colonization, this inland region has also been the home of and inspiration for many of the country\u2019s most celebrated artists, poets, writers and film-makers.
