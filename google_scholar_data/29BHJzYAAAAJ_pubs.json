            "The superconducting gap structure of recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor P r O s 4 S b 12 was investigated by using thermal transport measurements in magnetic field rotated relative to the crystal axes. We demonstrate that a novel change in the symmetry of the superconducting gap function occurs deep inside the superconducting state, giving a clear indication of the presence of two distinct superconducting phases with twofold and fourfold symmetries. We infer that the gap functions in both phases have a point node singularity, in contrast to the familiar line node singularity observed in almost all unconventional superconductors.",

The angular variation of \u03ba z z in H rotated within the a b plane shows a peculiar fourfold oscillation with narrow cusps. The amplitude of this fourfold oscillation becomes very small when H is rotated conically around the c axis with a tilt angle of 45. These results provide the first compelling evidence that the gap function has point nodes located along the a and b axes.

The magnetization measurements reveal a fish-tail hysteresis loop at high temperatures and a relatively high critical current density above Jc \u017e 105 A\/cm2 at low temperatures. The upper critical field determined by resistive transition is anisotropic with an anisotropic parameter of $3: 5. Hall effect measurements indicate that Ba (Fe0: 9Co0: 1) 2As2 is a multiband system and that the mobility of electrons is dominant. Magneto-optical imaging reveals a prominent Bean-like penetration of vortices, although there is a slight inhomogeneity in a sample. Moreover, we observe distinct superconductivity above 25 K, which leads us to speculate that a higher transition temperature can be realized by fine-tuning the Co-doping level.",
