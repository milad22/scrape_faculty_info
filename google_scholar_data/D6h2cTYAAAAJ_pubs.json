            "The book provides an elementary tutorial presentation on computational methods in fluid mechanics. The authors intend this book to serve as a survey of mathematical fundamentals which provide foundation for the computational fluid dynamics. As a result of this focus, the book is suitable as a textbook for a first course in CFD. The underlying philosophy of the authors is that the theory of linear algebra provides a basic mathematical framework for understanding numerical methods. Hence, the material presented emphasizes fundamental concepts of numerical methods in which the partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations, and finally to the difference equations, ie, to the linear system of algebraic equations. The book begins with an outline of the basic equations. The authors leading concept is to explain fundamentals of CFD on the basis of simple model equations, isolating physical \u2026",

The composites are made of two different material phases and a void phase. The topology optimization method consists in finding the distribution of material phases that optimizes an objective function (e.g. thermoelastic properties) subject to certain constraints, such as elastic symmetry or volume fractions of the constituent phases, within a periodic base cell. The effective properties of the material structures are found using the numerical homogenization method based on a finite-element discretization of the base cell. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming.To benchmark the design method we first consider two-phase designs.

A fundamental feature of that diversity is the necessity to classify individual jammed configurations according to whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly jammed. Each of these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations spanning a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive properties, including packing fraction \u03d5, mean contact number Z, and several scalar order metrics.

We also demonstrate the flexibility of the model by showing the emergence, and eventual dominance, of a second tumor clone with a different genotype. The model incorporates several important and novel features, both in the rules governing the model and in the underlying structure of the model.

            "Questions concerning the properties and quantification of density fluctuations in point patterns continue to provide many theoretical challenges. The purpose of this paper is to characterize certain fundamental aspects of local density fluctuations associated with general point patterns in any space dimension d. Our specific objectives are to study the variance in the number of points contained within a regularly shaped window \u03a9 of arbitrary size, and to further illuminate our understanding of hyperuniform systems, ie, point patterns that do not possess infinite-wavelength fluctuations. For large windows, hyperuniform systems are characterized by a local variance that grows only as the surface area (rather than the volume) of the window. We derive two formulations for the number variance:(i) an ensemble-average formulation, which is valid for statistically homogeneous systems, and (ii) a volume-average formulation \u2026",

            "In this first part of a series of two papers, we present in considerable detail a collision-driven molecular dynamics algorithm for a system of non-spherical particles, within a parallelepiped simulation domain, under both periodic or hard-wall boundary conditions. The algorithm extends previous event-driven molecular dynamics algorithms for spheres, and is most efficient when applied to systems of particles with relatively small aspect ratios and with small variations in size. We present a novel partial-update near-neighbor list (NNL) algorithm that is superior to previous algorithms at high densities, without compromising the correctness of the algorithm. This efficiency of the algorithm is further increased for systems of very aspherical particles by using bounding sphere complexes (BSC). These techniques will be useful in any particle-based simulation, including Monte Carlo and time-driven molecular dynamics \u2026",
