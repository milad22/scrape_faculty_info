            "Quantum computation and information is one of the most exciting developments in science and technology of the last twenty years. To achieve large scale quantum computers and communication networks it is essential not only to overcome noise in stored quantum information, but also in general faulty quantum operations. Scalable quantum computers require a far-reaching theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation. This comprehensive text, written by leading experts in the field, focuses on quantum error correction and thoroughly covers the theory as well as experimental and practical issues. The book is not limited to a single approach, but reviews many different methods to control quantum errors, including topological codes, dynamical decoupling and decoherence-free subspaces. Basic subjects as well as advanced theory and a survey of topics from cutting-edge research make this book invaluable both as a pedagogical introduction at the graduate level and as a reference for experts in quantum information science.",

In particular, efficient modern classical codes that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity).

Similar constructions for generalized measurements, however, have relied on the use of an ancilla system. We show that any generalized measurement can be decomposed into a sequence of weak measurements without the use of an ancilla, and give an explicit construction for these weak measurements. The measurement procedure has the structure of a random walk along a curve in state space, with the measurement ending when one of the end points is reached. This shows that any measurement can be generated by weak measurements, and hence that weak measurements are universal. This may have important applications to the theory of entanglement.",

            "Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before the walk reaches an ending condition. To be analogous to the hitting time for a classical walk, the quantum hitting time must involve repeated measurements as well as unitary evolution. We derive an expression for hitting time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the discrete walk on the hypercube. The values found are compared to other analogs of hitting time suggested in earlier work. The dependence of hitting times on the type of unitary \u201ccoin\u201d is examined, and we give an example of an initial state and coin which gives an infinite hitting time for a quantum walk. Such infinite hitting times require destructive interference, and are not observed classically. Finally, we look at distortions of the hypercube, and observe that a loss of symmetry in the hypercube increases the hitting time. Symmetry seems to play an important \u2026",
