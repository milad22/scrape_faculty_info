            "Turbulent fluxes of carbon, water vapor, and temperature were continuously measured above an upland forest in north central Wisconsin during 1999 and 2000 using the eddy covariance method. Maple (Acer saccharum), basswood (Tilia americana), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) species found in this forest also comprise a substantial portion of the landscape in the northern Great Lakes region and area, and it has been hypothesized that forests of this age (60\u201380 years) are responsible for net uptake of atmospheric CO2 over North America. Mean CO2, water vapor, and temperature profile measurements were used to improve flux estimates during periods of low turbulence, and were effective for friction velocities (u*) >0.3 m s\u22121. Unique observations at this site included nighttime and early morning venting anomalies that seemed to originate from a seemingly homogenous area within the forest. These \u2026",

The methodology for determining NEE from eddy\u2010covariance flux measurements at 30, 122 and 396\u2003m above the ground, and from CO2 mixing ratio measurements at 11, 30, 76, 122, 244 and 396\u2003m is described. The annual cycle of CO2 mixing ratio in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is also discussed, and the influences of local NEE and large\u2010scale advection are estimated. During 1997 gross ecosystem productivity (947\u221218\u2003g C\u2003m\u22122\u2003yr\u22121), approximately balanced total ecosystem respiration (963\u00b119\u2003g C\u2003m\u22122\u2003yr\u22121), and NEE of CO2 was close to zero (16\u00b119\u2003g C\u2003m\u22122\u2003yr\u22121 emitted into the atmosphere).

            "Methodology for determining fluxes of CO2 and H2O vapor with the eddy-covariance method using data from instruments on a 447-m tower in the forest of northern Wisconsin is addressed. The primary goal of this study is the validation of the methods used to determine the net ecosystem exchange of CO2. Two-day least squares fits coupled with 30-day running averages limit calibration error of infrared gas analyzers for CO2 and H2O signals to \u22482%\u20133%. Sonic anemometers are aligned with local streamlines by fitting a sine function to tilt and wind direction averages, and fitting a third-order polynomial to the residual. Lag times are determined by selecting the peak in lagged covariance with an error of \u22481.5%\u20132% for CO2 and \u22481% for H2O vapor. Theory and a spectral fit method allow determination of the underestimation in CO2 flux (<5% daytime, <12% nighttime) and H2O vapor flux (<21%), which is due to \u2026",
