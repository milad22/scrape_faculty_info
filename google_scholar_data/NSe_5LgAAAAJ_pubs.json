A recent surge of structural data on a number of GPCRs, including the \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR)\u2013G-protein complex, has provided novel insights into the structural basis of receptor activation 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. However, complementary information has been lacking on the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins to activated GPCRs, primarily owing to challenges in obtaining stable receptor\u2013\u03b2-arrestin complexes for structural studies. Here we devised a strategy for forming and purifying a functional human \u03b2 2 AR\u2013\u03b2-arrestin-1 complex that allowed us to visualize its architecture by single-particle negative-stain electron microscopy and to characterize the interactions between \u03b2 2 AR and \u03b2-arrestin 1 using hydrogen\u2013deuterium \u2026",

Here we analyse the sequence features influencing protein expression levels in 6,348 experiments using bacteriophage T7 polymerase to synthesize messenger RNA in Escherichia coli. Logistic regression yields a new codon-influence metric that correlates only weakly with genomic codon-usage frequency, but strongly with global physiological protein concentrations and also mRNA concentrations and lifetimes in vivo. Overall, the codon content influences protein expression more strongly than mRNA-folding parameters, although the latter dominate in the initial~ 16 codons.

We obtained cryo-EM reconstructions of preribosomal complexes lacking individual components to define the positions of all seven AFs bound to this intermediate. These late-binding AFs are positioned to prevent each step in the translation initiation pathway. Together, they obstruct the binding sites for initiation factors, prevent the opening of the messenger RNA channel, block 60S subunit joining, and disrupt the decoding site. These redundant mechanisms probably ensure that pre-40S particles do not enter the translation pathway, which \u2026",
