            "We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root\u2010mean\u2010square displacement of 0.26 \u00c5, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 \u00c5) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 \u00c5, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures \u2026",

The AT line shape consists of the superposition of several narrower twin peaks, one for each| M J|. The splitting is proportional to| M J| enabling resolution of the individual M J peaks. Thus, this all-optical technique can be used to align nonpolar molecules. The line shapes are in excellent agreement with theory.",

We have observed qualitatively expected behavior including a pronounced red wing in the reactive absorption profile indicating strong reaction probability on the excited attractive potential surfaces. We have also observed novel aspects of the excited state dynamics including reactive vs nonreactive channel competition effects and a strong far blue wing reactive absorption suggesting significant reaction probability even for trajectories on the repulsive surfaces. We have developed a simple theoretical model to semiquantitatively explain our experimental results.

The experimental data were fitted by a nonlinear least-squares fit program to obtain deperturbed molecular constants for both the A1\u03a3u+ and b3\u03a0u states. Improved Dunham coefficients of the A1\u03a3u+ state in the range 0 \u2264 v \u2264 62 are determined from the deperturbed Tv and Bv values including the v \u2264 12 region of this work, the v = 12\u201318 region in the work of Ross et al. [J. Phys. B.20, 6225\u20136231 (1987)], and the v = 21\u201362 region in the work of Lyyra et al. [J. Chem. Phys.92, 43\u201350 (1990)]. The electronic matrix element for the A1\u03a3u+ \u223c b3\u03a0u interaction is Hel = 18.64(9) cm\u22121, in good agreement with the value of 18.4 (2) cm\u22121 found by Ross et al.",
