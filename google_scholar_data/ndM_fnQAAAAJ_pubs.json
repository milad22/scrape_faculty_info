The expected correlated liquid and fcc and bcc solid phases were observed along with a glass phase at high concentration with structure similar to metallic glasses. At high volume fractions the finite core size leads to substantial deviation from predictions resulting from a screened Coulomb interaction.",

            "Nanoparticles (NPs) are emerging as promising carrier platforms for targeted drug delivery and imaging probes. To evaluate the delivery efficiency, it is important to predict the distribution of NPs within blood vessels. NP size, shape and vessel geometry are believed to influence its biodistribution in circulation. Whereas, the effect of size on nanoparticle distribution has been extensively studied, little is known about the shape and vessel geometry effect. This paper describes a computational model for NP transport and distribution in a mimetic branched blood vessel using combined NP Brownian dynamics and continuum fluid mechanics approaches. The simulation results indicate that NPs with smaller size and rod shape have higher binding capabilities as a result of smaller drag force and larger contact area. The binding dynamics of rod-shaped NPs is found to be dependent on their initial contact points \u2026",

By setting one of the trapped particles into forced oscillation using oscillating optical tweezers, we measure the displacement and phase shift of each of the particles over a wide frequency range. From the in-phase and out-of-phase motions of both of the particles in the traps, we determine the correlated motions of the coupled mechanical system as a function of frequency. A theoretical model is developed to calculate the response tensor of the coupled mechanical system. The experimental results are in agreement with the prediction of the theoretical model.

For colloidal particles in suspension, the relaxation of the ionic species in the shear layer gives rise to a frequency-dependent, bidirectional DEP force in the radio frequency range. However, quantification methods of the DEP force on individual particles with the pico-Newton resolution required for the development of theories and design of device applications are lacking. We report the use of optical tweezers as a force sensor and a lock-in phase-sensitive technique for analysis of the particle motion in an amplitude modulated DEP force. The coherent detection and sensing scheme yielded not only unprecedented sensitivity for DEP force measurements, but also provided a selectivity that clearly distinguishes the pure DEP \u2026",

In aqueous solutions, these polymers self-assemble to form micellar structures. Above a critical concentration, approximately 1 wt% of polymer, bridging between the micelles forms a transient network. Traditionally, the viscoelastic response of these polymeric solutions has been described using the Maxwell model. In this work we measure the viscoelastic properties over an extended frequency range (0.01\u20136000 Hz) using microrheology, and show that at high frequencies the rheology behaves as the square root of the oscillation frequency. To fit the data, we use a combination of the Maxwell model and the Rouse model. The Maxwell model accounts for the hydrophobic associations between the polymeric \u2026",

            "Although patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome require mechanical ventilation, these ventilators often exacerbate the existing lung injury. For example, the cyclic closure and reopening of fluid-filled airways during ventilation can cause epithelial cell (EpC) necrosis and barrier disruption. Although much work has focused on minimizing the injurious mechanical forces generated during ventilation, an alternative approach is to make the EpC less susceptible to injury by altering the cell's intrinsic biomechanical\/biostructural properties. In this study, we hypothesized that alterations in cytoskeletal structure and mechanics can be used to reduce the cell's susceptibility to injury during airway reopening. EpC were treated with jasplakinolide to stabilize actin filaments or latrunculin A to depolymerize actin and then exposed to cyclic airway reopening conditions at room temperature using a previously developed in \u2026",
