            "Fundamental understanding of the charge transport physics of hybrid lead halide perovskite semiconductors is important for advancing their use in high-performance optoelectronics. We use field-effect transistors (FETs) to probe the charge transport mechanism in thin films of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). We show that through optimization of thin-film microstructure and source-drain contact modifications, it is possible to significantly minimize instability and hysteresis in FET characteristics and demonstrate an electron field-effect mobility (\u03bcFET) of 0.5 cm2\/Vs at room temperature. Temperature-dependent transport studies revealed a negative coefficient of mobility with three different temperature regimes. On the basis of electrical and spectroscopic studies, we attribute the three different regimes to transport limited by ion migration due to point defects associated with grain boundaries, polarization disorder \u2026",

This review focuses on theoretical calculations and spectroscopic (electronic, vibrational, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) studies of endohedral fullerenes thus far published. A theoretical background, with various computational methods used for determining energy-optimized electronic structure and calculation of vibrational spectra, is presented. Further, theoretical and spectroscopic investigations of individual endohedral fullerenes are discussed. Such studies provide structural information about the carbon cage, position of the encapsulated species, and the degree of charge transfer. In particular, 13C NMR spectroscopy is indispensable for the determination of the cage symmetry. In some cases, NMR signals from 45Sc \u2026",

We determine the activation energy to promote the molecule from a nonplanar to a planar state to be 0.04 eV, in good agreement with our quantum chemical calculations. From the relative intensities of the 1280 cm\u2212 1 to the 1220 cm\u2212 1 Raman modes we show that high pressure planarizes the molecules, modifying the \u201cW\u201d-shaped potential energy curve to a \u201cU\u201d-shaped one.",

In the long-chain-polymers the photoluminescence transition energies blueshift with increasing temperatures.

The nascent polymer initially appears in a disordered state, but annealing at modest temperatures, just above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of 332 K, initiates structural evolution toward the well-known hexagonal-type phase. Cooling from the high-temperature liquid crystal mesophase yields the same basic phase structure but with much improved long-range order. Despite these large-scale changes in the PF2\/6 interchain ordering, optical spectroscopy resolves only subtle variations in the spectroscopic features. Thermal cycling above 330 K (near Tg) yields red shifts in the Franck\u2212Condon (FC) emission. These shifts are, in part, irreversible \u2026",

            "The \u03b2 phase in di-octyl substituted polyfluorene (PF8) exhibits a surprising level of conformational order at nanometer length scales compared to other phases. We present Raman scattering studies of PF8 as a function of thermal cycling, which establishes a connection between the conformational isomers and the side and main chain morphology. Density-functional calculations of the vibrational spectra of single chain oligomers in conjunction with the experimental results demonstrate the incompatibility of the \u03b2 phase with the overall \u03b1 crystalline phase in PF8.",
