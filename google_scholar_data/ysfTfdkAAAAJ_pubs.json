Chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer semiconductors are proposed as key components in industrial-scale flexible devices and building blocks of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures.

Here we report high 2D elastic moduli of CVD monolayer MoS2 and WS2 (\u223c170 N\/m), which is very close to the value of exfoliated MoS2 monolayers and almost half the value of the strongest material, graphene. The 2D moduli of their bilayer heterostructures are lower than the sum of 2D modulus of each layer but comparable to the corresponding bilayer homostructure, implying similar interactions between the hetero monolayers as between homo monolayers.

These provide a significantly improved description of bulk band structures, as well as defect geometries and wave functions. In order to properly describe carrier capture processes at charged centers, we put forward an approach to treat the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions on scattering states in the framework of supercell calculations.
