The kinetics of O2 reduction shows a significant enhancement at Pt monolayers on Pd(111) and Pd nanoparticle surfaces in comparison with the reaction on Pt(111) and Pt nanoparticles.

Noble metals (for example, gold and silver) have been demonstrated to reduce carbon dioxide at moderate rates and low overpotentials. Nevertheless, the development of inexpensive systems with an efficient carbon dioxide reduction capability remains a challenge. Here we identify molybdenum disulphide as a promising cost-effective substitute for noble metal catalysts. We uncover that molybdenum disulphide shows superior carbon dioxide reduction performance compared with the noble metals with a high current density and low overpotential (54 mV) in an ionic liquid. Scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis and first principle modelling reveal that the molybdenum-terminated edges of molybdenum disulphide are mainly responsible for its catalytic performance \u2026",

The white-line ratios M 5\/M 4 of the EELS spectra were used to determine the relative amounts of cerium ions Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ as a function of particle size. The fraction of Ce 3+ ions in the particles rapidly increased with decreasing particle size below\u223c 15 nm in diameter. The particles were completely reduced to CeO 1.5 at the diameter of<\u223c 3 nm. This reduced cerium oxide has a fluorite structure which is the same as that of bulk CeO 2.

Adding impurities (such as Ca in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-\u03b4; YBCO) leads to increased J c (refs 9, 10), which is generally attributed to excess holes introduced by Ca 2+ substituting for Y 3+(ref. 11).

To develop a profound understanding of the colossal resistance effects induced by external fields, the study of polaron correlations and the resulting collective polaron behavior, i.e., polaron ordering and transition from polaronic transport to metallic transport is essential. We show that static long-range ordering of Jahn\u2013Teller polarons forms a polaron solid which represents a new type of charge and orbital ordered state. The related noncentrosymmetric lattice distortions establish a connection between colossal resistance effects and multiferroic properties, i.e., the coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic ordering.
