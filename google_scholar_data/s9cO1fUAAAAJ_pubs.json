            "The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity\u2014which cannot be explained by weak electron\u2013phonon interactions\u2014in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1\u2014the first \u2018magic\u2019angle\u2014the electronic band structure of this \u2018twisted bilayer graphene\u2019exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling.

To apply this basis to a wider class of materials, the atomic characteristic of a pseudopotential is identified which leads to rapid convergence in the solid, and a new method for generating pseudopotentials optimized according to this criterion is shown. As a test case, an ab initio plane-wave basis determination of the structural properties of fcc copper is performed. The results indicate that these optimized pseudopotentials will facilitate study of transition metals and first-row nonmetals.",

This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials 1. One such property is the \u2018twist\u2019angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moir\u00e9 pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order.

In general, the growth mode is determined by the balance between surface, interface, and film free energies. Thus, if A wets B, B will not wet A. Any attempt at growing an A\/B\/A heterostructure must overcome this fundamental obstacle. We propose the use of a segregating surfactant to reduce the surface free energies of A and B and suppress island formation, as demonstrated in the growth of Si\/Ge\/Si (001) with a monolayer of As. Control of growth by amnipulation of surface energetics provides a new avenue to achieve high-quality man-made microstructures against thermodynamic odds.",

An empirical formula, consisting of an R\u22126 term is introduced, which is appropriately damped for short distances; the corresponding C6 coefficient, which is calculated from experimental atomic polarizabilities, can be consistently added to the total energy expression of the method. We apply this approximate DFT plus dispersion energy method to describe the hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions of nucleic acid base pairs. Comparison to MP2\/6-31G*(0.25) results shows that the method is capable of reproducing hydrogen bonding as well as the vertical and twist dependence of the interaction energy very accurately.",

            "We develop an empirical potential for silicon which represents a considerable improvement over existing models in describing local bonding for bulk defects and disordered phases. The model consists of two-and three-body interactions with theoretically motivated functional forms that capture chemical and physical trends as explained in a companion paper. The numerical parameters in the functional form are obtained by fitting to a set of ab initio results from quantum-mechanical calculations based on density-functional theory in the local-density approximation, which include various bulk phases and defect structures. We test the potential by applying it to the relaxation of point defects, core properties of partial dislocations and the structure of disordered phases, none of which are included in the fitting procedure. For dislocations, our model makes predictions in excellent agreement with ab initio and tight-binding \u2026",

            "We use recent theoretical advances to develop a functional form for interatomic forces in bulk silicon. The theoretical results underlying the model include an analysis of elastic properties for the diamond and graphitic structures and inversions of ab initio cohesive energy curves. The interaction model includes two-body and three-body terms which depend on the local atomic environment through an effective coordination number. This formulation is able to capture successfully (i) the energetics and elastic properties of the ground-state diamond lattice,(ii) the covalent rehybridization of undercoordinated atoms, and (iii) a smooth transition to metallic bonding for overcoordinated atoms. Because the essential features of chemical bonding in the bulk are built into the functional form, this model promises to be useful for describing interatomic forces in silicon bulk phases and defects. Although this functional form is \u2026",
