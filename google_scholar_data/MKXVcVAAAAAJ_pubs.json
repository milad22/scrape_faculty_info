            "We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of \u223c100M\u2299 (whereM\u2299 is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 109 per cubic centimeter, a 1M\u2299 protostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does \u2026",

The results agree well with numerically expensive three-dimensional simulations, and our approach has the advantage of being able to explore large regions of parameter space rapidly.

We derived new fits of rate coefficients for the photo-attachment of neutral hydrogen, the formation of molecular hydrogen via H-, charge exchange between H2 and H+, electron detachment of H-by neutral hydrogen, dissociative recombination of H2 with slow electrons, photodissociation of H2+, and photodissociation of H2. Further it was found that the molecular hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes, H2++ H-> H2+ H+, and H-+ H-> H2+ e-, is likely to be converted into its para configuration on a faster time scale than the formation time scale. We have tested the model extensively and shown it to agree well with former studies. We further studied the chemical kinetics in great detail and devised a minimal model which is substantially simpler than the full reaction network but predicts correct abundances. This minimal model shows convincingly that 12 collisional processes are sufficient to model the H, He, H+, H-, He+, He++, and H2 abundances in low density primordial gas for applications with no radiation fields.",

            "We study the formation of the first generation of stars in the standard cold dark matter model. We use a very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that achieves a dynamic range of \u223c1010 in length scale. With accurate treatment of atomic and molecular physics, including the effect of molecular line opacities and cooling by collision\u2010induced continuum emission, it allows us to study the chemothermal evolution of primordial gas clouds to densities up to   g cm\u22123 (  cm\u22123) without assuming any a priori equation of state, an improvement of 6 orders of magnitude over previous three\u2010dimensional calculations. We study the evolution of a primordial star\u2010forming gas cloud in the cosmological simulation in detail. The cloud core becomes marginally unstable against chemothermal instability when the gas cooling rate is increased owing to three\u2010body molecule formation. However, since the core is already \u2026",
