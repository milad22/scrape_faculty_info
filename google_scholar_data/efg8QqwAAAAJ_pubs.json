Unfortunately, the statistical analysis of response curves in ecology generally has either been ignored or incorrectly done. In an effort to encourage rigorous analysis of response data, we address statistical treatment of response curves and illustrate the correct alternatives that are available.

The techniques presented fall into two distinct categories, methods based on ranks and \"computer\u2014intensive\" techniques. Distribution\u2014free rank tests have features that can be recommended. They free the practitioner from concern about the underlying distribution and are very robust to outliers. If the distribution underlying the observations is other than normal, rank tests tend to be more efficient than their parametric counterparts. The absence, in computing packages, or rank procedures for complex designs may, however, severely limit their use for ecological data.

            "Changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, nutrient enrichment, and environmental stress often lead to reduced plant diversity in ecosystems. However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity.Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season.

After 5\u2003years of growth, mixed\u2010species plots yielded, on average, 30\u201358% higher summed tree basal area than did monocultures. Simulation models revealed that the increased yield of mixed\u2010species plots was due mostly to enhancement of individual tree growth.

A study with an indigenous community in eastern Panama revealed a considerable biophysical potential for carbon offsets in small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture through longer fallow periods, improved fallow management, secondary forest development, and agricultural intensification. Based on soil and biomass carbon measurements, estimated annual sequestration rates amount to 0.3\u22123.7 t C ha\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1. Despite such potential, the economic benefits of initiatives aimed at sequestration of carbon in the community are likely to be rather unequally distributed within the community.
