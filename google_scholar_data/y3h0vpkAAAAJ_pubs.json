We show that SS- and FD-OCT have equivalent expressions for system signal-to-noise ratio which result in a typical sensitivity advantage of 20-30dB over TD-OCT. Experimental verification is provided using two novel spectral discrimination (SD) OCT systems: a differential fiber-based 800nm FD-OCT system which employs deep-well photodiode arrays, and a differential 1300nm SS-OCT system based on a swept laser with an 87nm tuning range.",

Optical coherence tomography is a novel noninvasive, noncontact imaging modality which produces high depth resolution (10 \u03bcm cross-sectional tomographs of ocular tissue. It is analogous to ultrasound, except that optical rather than acoustic reflectivity is measured.Methods: Optical coherence tomography images of the macula were obtained in 51 eyes of 44 patients with selected macular diseases. Imaging is performed in a manner compatible with slit-lamp indirect biomicroscopy so that high-resolution optical tomography may be accomplished simultaneously with normal ophthalmic examination. The time-of-flight delay of light backscattered from different layers in the retina is determined using low-coherence interferometry. Cross-sectional tomographs of the retina \u2026",

            "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the optical analog of ultrasound imaging and is emerging as a powerful imaging technique that enables non-invasive, in vivo, high resolution, cross-sectional imaging in biological tissue. A new generation OCT technology has now been developed, representing a quantum leap in resolution and speed, achieving in vivo optical biopsy, ie the visualization of tissue architectural morphology in situ and in real time. Functional extensions of OCT technology enable non-invasive, depth resolved functional assessment and imaging of tissue. These new techniques should not only improve image contrast, but should also enable the differentiation of pathologies via metabolic properties or functional state. The book introduces OCT technology and applications not only from an optical and technological viewpoint, but also from biomedical and clinical perspectives. The chapters are written by leading international research groups, in a style comprehensible to a broad audience. It will be of interest not only to physicists, scientists and engineers, but also to biomedical and clinical researchers from different medical specialties.",

            "We describe a novel optical system for bidirectional color Doppler imaging of flow in biological tissues with micrometer-scale resolution and demonstrate its use for in vivo imaging of blood flow in an animal model. Our technique, color Doppler optical coherence tomography (CDOCT), performs spatially localized optical Doppler velocimetry by use of scanning low-coherence interferometry. CDOCT is an extension of optical coherence tomography (OCT), employing coherent signal-acquisition electronics and joint time-frequency analysis algorithms to perform flow imaging simultaneous with conventional OCT imaging. Cross-sectional maps of blood flow velocity with <50-\u00b5m spatial resolution and <0.6-mm\/s velocity precision were obtained through intact skin in living hamster subdermal tissue. This technology has several potential medical applications.",

            "Background Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recently developed medical diagnostic technology that uses back-reflected infrared light to perform in situ micron scale tomographic imaging. In this work, we investigate the ability of OCT to perform micron scale tomographic imaging of the internal microstructure of in vitro atherosclerotic plaques. Methods and Results Aorta and relevant nonvascular tissue were obtained at autopsy. Two-dimensional cross-sectional imaging of the exposed surface of the arterial segments was performed in vitro with OCT. A 1300-nm wavelength, superluminescent diode light source was used that allows an axial spatial resolution of 20 \u03bcm. The signal-to-noise ratio was 109 dB. Images were displayed in gray scale or false color. Imaging was performed over 1.5 mm into heavily calcified tissue, and a high contrast was noted between lipid- and water-based constituents, making \u2026",
