O\u00f6mycetes such as these Phytophthora species share the kingdom Stramenopila with photosynthetic algae such as diatoms, and the presence of many Phytophthora genes of probable phototroph origin supports a photosynthetic ancestry for the stramenopiles. Comparison of the two species9 genomes reveals a rapid expansion and diversification of many protein families associated with plant infection such as hydrolases, ABC transporters, protein toxins, proteinase inhibitors, and, in particular, a superfamily of 700 proteins with similarity to known o\u00f6mycete avirulence genes.",

Using the effector protein Avr1b of Phytophthora sojae, an oomycete pathogen of soybean (Glycine max), we show that a pair of sequence motifs, RXLR and dEER, plus surrounding sequences, are both necessary and sufficient to deliver the protein into plant cells. Particle bombardment experiments demonstrate that these motifs function in the absence of the pathogen, indicating that no additional pathogen-encoded machinery is required for effector protein entry into host cells. Furthermore, fusion of the Avr1b RXLR-dEER domain to green fluorescent protein (GFP) allows GFP to enter soybean root cells autonomously. The conclusion that RXLR and dEER serve to transduce oomycete effectors into host cells indicates that the >370 RXLR-dEER\u2013containing \u2026",

We identify 1,584 and 1,678 gene models specific to the wild and domesticated varieties, respectively, and discover high heterozygosity and millions of single-nucleotide variations. Our analyses reveal that genes involved in photosynthesis, starch accumulation and abiotic stresses have been positively selected, whereas those involved in cell wall biosynthesis and secondary metabolism, including cyanogenic glucoside formation, have been negatively selected in the cultivated varieties, reflecting the result of natural selection and domestication.

Among the preparation methods developed, the nuclei method is the simplest and most widely used for preparing high-quality megabase-sized DNA from divergent organisms. In this method, nuclei are first isolated by physically grinding the source tissues. The nontarget cytoplast organellar genomes and metabolites are removed by centrifugation and washing, thus maximizing the utility of the method and substantially improving the digestibility and clonability of the resultant DNA. The nuclei are then embedded in an agarose matrix containing numerous pores, allowing the access of restriction enzymes while preventing the DNA from physical shearing. DNA is extracted from the nuclei, purified and subsequently manipulated in the agarose matrix. Here we describe the nuclei method that we have successfully used to prepare high \u2026",

            "Large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries are necessary for advanced genetics and genomics research. To facilitate gene cloning and characterization, genome analysis, and physical mapping of scallop, two BAC libraries were constructed from nuclear DNA of Zhikong scallop, Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston. The libraries were constructed in the BamHI and MboI sites of the vector pECBAC1, respectively. The BamHI library consists of 73,728 clones, and approximately 99% of the clones contain scallop nuclear DNA inserts with an average size of 110 kb, covering 8.0\u00d7 haploid genome equivalents. Similarly, the MboI library consists of 7680 clones, with an average insert of 145 kb and no insert-empty clones, thus providing a genome coverage of 1.1\u00d7. The combined libraries collectively contain a total of 81,408 BAC clones arrayed in 212 384-well microtiter plates, representing 9.1\u00d7 \u2026",
