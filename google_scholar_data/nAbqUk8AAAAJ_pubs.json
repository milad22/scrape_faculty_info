            "The paper focuses on conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance (no-till, NT) and permanent soil cover (mulch) combined with rotations, as a more sustainable cultivation system for the future. Cultivation and tillage play an important role in agriculture. The benefits of tillage in agriculture are explored before introducing conservation tillage (CT), a practice that was borne out of the American dust bowl of the 1930s. The paper then describes the benefits of CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where NT, mulch and rotations significantly improve soil properties and other biotic factors. The paper concludes that CA is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly management system for cultivating crops. Case studies from the rice\u2013wheat areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia and the irrigated maize\u2013wheat systems of Northwest Mexico are used to describe how CA practices have been \u2026",

            "Climate change could strongly affect the wheat crop that accounts for 21% of food and 200 million hectares of farmland worldwide. This article reviews some of the approaches for addressing the expected effects that climate change may likely inflict on wheat in some of the most important wheat growing areas, namely germplasm adaptation, system management, and mitigation. Future climate scenarios suggest that global warming may be beneficial for the wheat crop in some regions, but could reduce productivity in zones where optimal temperatures already exist. For example, by 2050, as a result of possible climate shifts in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs) \u2013 currently part of the favorable, high potential, irrigated, low rainfall mega-environment, which accounts for 15% of global wheat production \u2013 as much as 51% of its area might be reclassified as a heat-stressed, irrigated, short-season production mega \u2026",

            "The rice\u2013wheat cropping system, occupying 24 million hectares of the productive area in South Asia and China, is important for food security. Monitoring long-term changes in crop yields and identifying the factors associated with such changes are essential to maintain and\/or improve crop productivity. Long-term experiments (LTE) provide these opportunities. We analyzed 33 rice\u2013wheat LTE in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia, non-IGP in India, and China to investigate the extent of yield stagnation or decline and identify possible causes of yield decline. In treatments where recommended rates of N, P and K were applied, yields of rice and wheat stagnated in 72 and 85% of the LTE, respectively, while 22 and 6% of the LTE showed a significant (P<0.05) declining trend for rice and wheat yields, respectively. In the rice\u2013wheat system, particularly in the IGP, rice yields are declining more rapidly than wheat \u2026",

In order to minimize vagaries of arid weather, bring more land under irrigation, and produce and stabilize greater yields per unit area, numerous water development projects have been commissioned all over the world. Extension of irrigation to the arid regions, however, usually had led to an increase in the area affected by shallow water tables and to intensifying and expanding the hazards of salinity. This is because irrigation water brings in additional salts and releases immobilized salts in the soil through mineral dissolution and weathering, and losing water volumes through evapotranspiration and concentrating the dissolved salts in soil \u2026",

Sodium influx and sustained high intracellular Na+ ion concentration appear to initiate the mitogenic process and cell division in vitro. High intracellular Na+ ion concentrations appear to be associated with mitogenesis and oncogenesis in vivo as well (3).

            "Conventional tillage and crop establishment methods such as puddled transplanting in the rice\u2013wheat (Oryza sativa L.\u2013Triticum aestivum L.) system in the Indo\u2010Gangetic Plains (IGP) require a large amount of water and labor, both of which are increasingly becoming scarce and expensive. We attempted to evaluate alternatives that would require smaller amounts of these two inputs. A field experiment was conducted in the IGP for 2 yr to evaluate various tillage and crop establishment systems for their efficiency in labor, water, and energy use and economic profitability. The yields of rice in the conventional puddled transplanting and direct\u2010seeding on puddled or nonpuddled (no\u2010tillage) flat bed systems were equal. Yields of wheat following either the puddled\u2010transplanted or no\u2010tillage direct\u2010seeded rice were also equal. Normally, puddled transplanting required 35 to 40% more irrigation water than no\u2010tillage direct \u2026",

            "The adsorption of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions on formaldehyde treated sawdust (SD) and sulphuric acid treated sawdust carbon (SDC) of Indian Rosewood, a timber industry waste, was studied at varying Cr(VI) concentrations, adsorbent dose, pH and agitation time. Similar experiments were conducted with commercially available coconut based activated carbon to compare the results. The Cr(VI) adsorption efficiency on SDC was higher than SD. The adsorption followed first order rate expression and Lagergren equation. An initial pH of 3.0 was most favorable for Cr(VI) removal by both the adsorbents. Maximum Cr(VI) was sequestered from the solution within 60 min after the beginning for every experiment. It is proposed that SDC and SD can be potential adsorbents for Cr(VI) removal from dilute solutions.",

            "In recent years conventional production technologies in the rice\u2013wheat (RW) system have been leading to deterioration of soil health and declining farm profitability due to high inputs of water and labour. Conservation agriculture (CA)-based resource-conserving technologies (RCTs) vis-\u00e0-vis zero-till (ZT), raised-bed planting and direct-seeded rice (DSR) have shown promise as alternatives to conventional production technologies to overcome these problems. The integration of CA-based RCTs with precision agriculture (PA)-based technologies in a systems perspective could provide a better option for sustainable RW production systems. In this study we attempted to evaluate conservation and precision agriculture (CPA)-based RCTs as a double-ZT system integrated with laser-assisted precision land leveling (PLL) in the RW system. A field experiment was conducted in the western IGP for 2 years to evaluate \u2026",
