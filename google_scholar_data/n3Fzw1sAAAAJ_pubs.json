            "This is the second edition of this advanced textbook written for scientists who require further training in femtosecond science. Four years after publication of the first edition, femtosecond science has overcome new challenges and new application fields have become mature. It is necessary to take into account these new developments. Two main topics merged during this period that support important scientific activities: attosecond pulses are now generated in the X-UV spectral domain, and coherent control of chemical events is now possible by tailoring the shape of femtosecond pulses. To update this advanced textbook, it was necessary to introduce these fields; two new chapters are in this second edition:\u201cCoherent Control in Atoms, Molecules, and Solids\u201d(Chap. 11) and \u201cAttosecond Pulses\u201d(Chap. 12) with well-documented references.Some changes, addenda, and new references are introduced in the first edition \u2026",
