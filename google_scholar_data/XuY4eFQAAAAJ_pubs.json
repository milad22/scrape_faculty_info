The issue is subtle for two reasons: there is a discontinuity in the mass in the lowest tree-level approximation, and, moreover, the nonlinear four-dimensional theory of a massive graviton is not defined unambiguously. First, we reiterate the old argument that for vanishing graviton mass the lowest tree-level approximation breaks down since the higher order corrections are singular in the graviton mass. However, there can exist nonperturbative solutions which correspond to the summation of the singular terms, and these solutions are continuous in the graviton mass. Furthermore, we study a completely nonlinear and generally covariant five-dimensional model which mimics the properties of the four-dimensional theory of massive gravity. We show that the exact solutions of the model are continuous in the mass, yet the perturbative \u2026",

There is no normalizable zero-mode graviton in this case, nevertheless correct Newton's law can be obtained by exchanging bulk gravitons. This can be interpreted as an exchange of a single metastable 4D graviton. Such theories have remarkable phenomenological signatures since the evolution of the Universe becomes high-dimensional at very large scales. Furthermore, the bulk supersymmetry in the infinite volume limit might be preserved while being completely broken on a brane. This gives rise to a possibility of controlling the value of the bulk cosmological constant.

Spin one-half and three-half states can be localized on a brane with \u201cnegative tension\u201d. Their localization can be achieved on the positive-tension brane as well, if additional interactions are introduced. The necessary ingredient of the scenario with localized gravity is the relation between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension.

            "Massive gravity in 4 dimensions has been shown to be free of the Boulware\u2013Deser (BD) ghost in the ADM language for a specific choice of mass terms. We show here how this is consistent with the St\u00fcckelberg language beyond the decoupling limit, and how the constraint required to remove the BD ghost arises in this framework non-perturbatively, without the use of field redefinitions. We emphasize a subtlety in obtaining this constraint, that has been overlooked in previous literature. In both the ADM and St\u00fcckelberg formalisms the vanishing of the determinant of a Hessian guarantees the absence of the BD ghost.",
