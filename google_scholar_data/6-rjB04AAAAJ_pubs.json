            "The basic goals of Peer Instruction are to encourage and make use of student interaction during lectures, while focusing students' attention on underlying concepts and techniques. The method has been assessed in many studies using standardized, diagnostic tests and shown to be considerably more effective than the conventional lecture approach to teaching. Peer Instruction is now used in a wide range of science and math courses at the college and secondary level. In this hour long workshop, participants will learn about Peer Instruction, serve as the\" class\" in which Peer Instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources.",

            "We report data from ten years of teaching with Peer Instruction (PI) in the calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses for nonmajors; our results indicate increased student mastery of both conceptual reasoning and quantitative problem solving upon implementing PI. We also discuss ways we have improved our implementation of PI since introducing it in 1991. Most notably, we have replaced in-class reading quizzes with pre-class written responses to the reading, introduced a research-based mechanics textbook for portions of the course, and incorporated cooperative learning into the discussion sections as well as the lectures. These improvements are intended to help students learn more from pre-class reading and to increase student engagement in the discussion sections, and are accompanied by further increases in student understanding.",

Minimizing the width of the waveguides is desirable for photonic device applications, but the fabrication of low-loss optical waveguides with subwavelength diameters remains challenging because of strict requirements on surface roughness and diameter uniformity 4, 5, 6, 7. Here we report the fabrication of subwavelength-diameter silica \u2018wires\u2019 for use as low-loss optical waveguides within the visible to near-infrared spectral range. We use a two-step drawing process to fabricate long free-standing silica wires with diameters down to 50 nm that show surface smoothness at the atomic level together with uniformity of diameter. Light can be launched into these wires by optical evanescent coupling. The wires allow single-mode operation, and have an optical \u2026",

Bits are recorded by      use of a 0.65-N.A. objective to focus 100-fs laser pulses inside the material.      The laser pulse produces a submicrometer-diameter structurally altered region      with high contrast in index of refraction. We record binary information by      writing such bits in multiple planes and read it out with a microscope objective      with a short depth of field. We demonstrate data storage and retrieval with       2-\u03bcm in-plane bit spacing and       15-\u03bcm interplane spacing (17 Gbits\/cm^3).      Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy show structural changes      confined to an area 200 nm in diameter.",
