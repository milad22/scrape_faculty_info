It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the\" spin-boson\" problem;(2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem;(3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space \u2026",

The imaginary part of the relaxation time and the normal-state Hall effect both break \u2018\u2018particle-hole symmetry,\u2019\u2019and produce a component of the vortex velocity parallel to the transport current, and consequently a Hall field due to the vortex motion.

            "We consider the scaling properties of the linear ac and nonlinear dc conductivities of a superconductor near the transition temperature T c. We first review a scaling theory of the conductivity near a critical point recently proposed by Fisher, Fisher, and Huse. By combining these scaling assumptions with causality arguments, we show that the phase \u03c6 \u03c3 of the linear ac conductivity takes on a universal value near the critical point, \u03c6 \u03c3= \u03c0 (2-d+z)\/2z, where d is the spatial dimension and z is the dynamic critical exponent. Hence, a measurement of the phase lag between the current and the voltage near the critical point provides a measurement of the exponent z. Then, using relaxational dynamics, we calculate these conductivities for 2< d< 4, using (a) a Gaussian approximation, in which the quartic term in the Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian is neglected, and (b) an O (2n) generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau \u2026",

This transition is argued to have a \u2018\u2018hidden\u2019\u2019particle-hole symmetry, and a new exponent is introduced to characterize the irrelevance of the particle-hole asymmetry. This leads to a natural explanation of the scaling of the Hall and Longitudinal resistivities observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7. At the transition, the nonlinear Hall voltage is predicted to vary with a universal power of the current, and the linear ac Hall conductivity with a universal power of the frequency.",
