This paper presents the design and analysis of a novel thermally tunable composite, namely, a flexible open\u2010cell foam coated in wax that can achieve significant ranges of stiffness, strength, and volume. Experimental results were compared to a proposed model for predicting the bulk compression modulus of the composites. Additionally, preliminary studies indicate that the composites exhibit self\u2010healing properties, in which heating between loading cycles can mend wax that has been plastically deformed, for example, by cracking or delaminating from the foam.",

These environments can be water-like and Newtonian but can frequently contain macromolecules, flexible polymers, soft cells, or hard particles, which impart complex, nonlinear rheological features to the fluid. While significant progress has been made on understanding how active colloids move and interact in Newtonian fluids, little is known on how active colloids behave in complex and non-Newtonian fluids. An emerging literature is starting to show how fluid rheology can dramatically change the gaits and speeds of individual swimmers. Simultaneously, a moving swimmer induces time dependent, three dimensional fluid flows that can modify the medium (fluid) rheological properties. This two-way, non-linear coupling at \u2026",

Here, we experimentally investigate the run-and-tumble dynamics of the bacterium E. coli in polymeric solutions. We find that even small amounts of polymer in solution can drastically change E. coli dynamics: cells tumble less and their velocity increases, leading to an enhancement in cell translational diffusion and a sharp decline in rotational diffusion. We show that suppression of tumbling is due to fluid viscosity while the enhancement in swimming speed is mainly due to fluid elasticity. Visualization of single fluorescently labeled DNA polymers reveals that the flow generated by individual E. coli is sufficiently strong to stretch polymer molecules and induce elastic stresses in the fluid, which in turn can act on the cell in such a way to enhance its transport.

The self-regulating nature of the flow yields phase separation, ubiquitous in this class of systems, and controls the formation of solitary waves.

We show by direct experimental observation of the bi-flagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that fluid elasticity and viscosity strongly influence the beating pattern-the gait-and thereby control the propulsion speed. The beating frequency and the wave speed characterizing the cyclical bending are both enhanced by fluid elasticity. Despite these enhancements, the net swimming speed of the alga is hindered for fluids that are sufficiently elastic. The origin of this complex response lies in the interplay between the elasticity-induced changes in the spatial and temporal aspects of the flagellar cycle and the buildup and subsequent relaxation of elastic stresses during the power and recovery strokes.",

The coefficient of restitution decreases with increasing Weber number and becomes insensitive to the viscosity of the gas at Weber numbers larger than about 1. At smaller Weber numbers, drops in a less viscous gas lose less energy during the collision. Drops are observed to undergo a transition from coalescence to bouncing as the drop velocity (Weber number) is increased. However, the marginal condition for drop bouncing is much more sensitive to gas mean-free path (Knudsen number) and gas viscosity (Ohnesorge number) than to Weber number. The Knudsen and Ohnesorge numbers are defined as Kn= \u03bb\/a and Oh= \u00b5g\/(\u03c1la\u03c3) 1\/2 where \u03bb is the mean-free path and \u00b5g is the gas viscosity.

Surprisingly, we find a regime in which larger particles can diffuse faster than smaller particles: the particle long-time effective diffusivity exhibits a peak in particle size, which is a deviation from classical thermal diffusion.

Our focus will be on small droplets with radii in the range O (5)\u2212 O (100) \u00b5m. Collisions of such small droplets are encountered in many interesting processes as diverse as rain drop formation (see for example, Fuchs 1964; Hidy & Brock 1970; Mason 1971; Brazier-Smith, Jennings & Latham 1972, and references therein), spray combustion and painting, pressurized turbines and aerosol coagulation (Friedlander 1977). For drops in this size range, the dominant factor driving collision is usually drop inertia and the impact energy involved in the collision is small compared with the surface energy associated with the gas\u2013liquid interfaces. The velocities, shape and separation of the approaching interfaces control the hydrodynamic forces acting on the drops and determine the minimum possible distance between the drops.When two drops collide in a gas, they may bounce apart or they may come into contact. A bounce occurs if the pressure in the gas film separating the drops deforms the drop surfaces sufficiently to transform the drops\u2019 kinetic energy into deformation energy before the gas film becomes thin enough for lubrication breakdown to occur. In this paper, we study droplet collisions that result in a bounce. The collisions are assumed to take place in an incompressible, continuum gas and so the drops undergoing collision cannot come into contact; the nature of the continuum lubrication force prevents this from occurring. We also assume that the effects of inter-particle forces such as the London\u2013van der Waals dispersion forces \u2026",
