The state is spectrally located inside the photonic band gaps of each of the photonic crystals comprising this magnetophotonic structure. This state is associated with a sharp transmission peak through the sample and is responsible for the substantial enhancement of the Faraday rotation for the corresponding wavelength. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.",

The nature of surface electromagnetic states localized at the PC boundary is discussed; these states transfer no energy along the boundary (their tangential wave number is zero). An analogy with the well-known Tamm and Shockley surface states in solid state physics is drawn. It is shown that in the case of a PC, both types of states can be regarded as Tamm states. Experimental results on the observation of surface states are presented. A system using an external magnetic field to control a surface state is considered.",
