Above the yield strain, the foam begins to flow. The flow consists of irregular intervals of elastic stretch followed by sudden reductions of the stress, ie, stress drops. We report on the distribution of the stress drops as a function of the applied shear rate. We also comment on our results in the context of various two-dimensional models of foams.",

In samples with conductivities greater than 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 per ohm per meter, STC was found to evolve by means of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation from the uniform conduction state. Because this example of STC resulted from nonlinear interactions between only four modes, it provides a realistic opportunity to understand the observed phenomena in terms of a weakly nonlinear theory in the form of four coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equations derived from the full equations of motion of the system. For smaller conductivities, the pattern immediately above onset consisted of localized pulses of convection that coexisted with the conduction state. The pulses had a unique width in the direction perpendicular to the director (the axis parallel to the average orientation) and had much larger and varying lengths parallel to \u2026",

The details of such shear localization can vary depending on the system being studied. A number of the systems of interest are confined so as to be quasi two-dimensional, and an important issue in these systems is the role of the confining boundaries. For foams, three basic systems have been studied with very different boundary conditions: Hele-Shaw cells (bubbles confined between two solid plates); bubble rafts (a single layer of bubbles freely floating on a surface of water); and confined bubble rafts (bubbles confined between the surface of water below and a glass plate on top).

For higher values of the conductivity, the primary instability is a subcritical bifurcation to a single set of stationary oblique rolls.

            "Surfactants at air\/water interfaces are often subjected to mechanical stresses as the interfaces they occupy are reduced in area. The most well characterized forms of stress relaxation in these systems are first order phase transitions from lower density to higher density phases. Here we study stress relaxation in lipid monolayers that occurs once chemical phase transitions have been exhausted. At these highly compressed states, the monolayer undergoes global mechanical relaxations termed collapse. By studying four different types of monolayers, we determine that collapse modes are most closely linked to in-plane rigidity. We characterize the rigidity of the monolayer by analyzing in-plane morphology on numerous length scales. More rigid monolayers collapse out-of-plane via a hard elastic mode similar to an elastic membrane, while softer monolayers relax in-plane by shearing.",
