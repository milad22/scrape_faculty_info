            "Lapatinib is active at the ATP-binding site of tyrosine kinases that are associated with the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Her-1 or ErbB1) and Her-2. It is conceivable that lapatinib may inhibit the function of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters by binding to their ATP-binding sites. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of lapatinib to reverse tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) due to overexpression of ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) transporters. Our results showed that lapatinib significantly enhanced the sensitivity to ABCB1 or ABCG2 substrates in cells expressing these transporters, although a small synergetic effect was observed in combining lapatinib and conventional chemotherapeutic agents in parental sensitive MCF-7 or S1 cells. Lapatinib alone, however, did not significantly alter the sensitivity of non-ABCB1 or non-ABCG2 substrates \u2026",

            "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal disease characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph+) chromosome and its oncogenic product, BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, that is present in >90% of the patients. Epidemiologic data indicates that almost 5000 new cases are reported every year and 10% of these patients eventually succumb to the disease. The treatment of CML was revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec\u00ae), a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The clinical use of specific BCR-ABL inhibitors has resulted in a significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens. However, the complete eradication of CML in patients receiving imatinib was limited by the emergence of resistance mostly due to mutations in the ABL kinase domain and to a lesser extent \u2026",

            "Nilotinib, a BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was developed to surmount resistance or intolerance to imatinib in patients with Philadelphia positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Recently, it was shown that several human multidrug resistance (MDR) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins could be modulated by specific TKIs. MDR can produce cancer chemotherapy failure, typically due to overexpression of ABC transporters, which are involved in the extrusion of therapeutic drugs. Here, we report for the first time that nilotinib potentiates the cytotoxicity of widely used therapeutic substrates of ABCG2, such as mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and ABCB1 substrates including colchicine, vincristine, and paclitaxel. Nilotinib also significantly enhances the accumulation of paclitaxel in cell lines overexpressing ABCB1.

The ABC transporters are present in a number of tissues, providing protection against xenobiotics and certain endogenous molecules. Unfortunately, their presence produces suboptimal chemotherapeutic outcomes in cancer patient tumor cells. It is well established that they actively efflux antineoplastic agents from cancer cells, producing the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. The inadequate response to chemotherapy and subsequent poor prognosis in cancer patients can be in part the result of the overexpression of ABC transporters. In fact, one of the targeted approaches for overcoming MDR in cancer cells is that directed towards blocking or inhibiting ABC transporters.

            "A panel of clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors were compared and nilotinib was found to most potently sensitize specific anticancer agents by blocking the functions of ABCB1\/P-glycoprotein, ABCG2\/BCRP and ABCC10\/MRP7 transporters involved in multi-drug resistance. Nilotinib appreciably enhanced the antitumor response of (1) paclitaxel in the ABCB1- and novel ABCC10-xenograft models, and (2) doxorubicin in a novel ABCG2-xenograft model. With no apparent toxicity observed in the above models, nilotinib attenuated tumor growth synergistically and increased paclitaxel concentrations in ABCB1-overexpressing tumors. The beneficial actions of nilotinib warrant consideration as viable combinations in the clinic with agents that suffer from MDR-mediated insensitivity.",
