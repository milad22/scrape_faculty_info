            "Many materials systems are currently under consideration as potential replacements for SiO2 as the gate dielectric material for sub-0.1 \u03bcm complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) technology. A systematic consideration of the required properties of gate dielectrics indicates that the key guidelines for selecting an alternative gate dielectric are (a) permittivity, band gap, and band alignment to silicon, (b) thermodynamic stability, (c) film morphology, (d) interface quality, (e) compatibility with the current or expected materials to be used in processing for CMOS devices, (f) process compatibility, and (g) reliability. Many dielectrics appear favorable in some of these areas, but very few materials are promising with respect to all of these guidelines. A review of current work and literature in the area of alternate gate dielectrics is given. Based on reported results and fundamental considerations, the pseudobinary \u2026",

Their widespread use is limited by their low energy storage density and relatively high effective series resistance. Using chemical activation of exfoliated graphite oxide, we synthesized a porous carbon with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of up to 3100 square meters per gram, a high electrical conductivity, and a low oxygen and hydrogen content. This sp2-bonded carbon has a continuous three-dimensional network of highly curved, atom-thick walls that form primarily 0.6- to 5-nanometer-width pores. Two-electrode supercapacitor cells constructed with this carbon yielded high values of gravimetric capacitance and energy density with organic and ionic liquid electrolytes. The processes used to make this carbon are readily scalable to industrial levels.",

The prototypical 2D material molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is reported to have a maximum QY of 0.6%, which indicates a considerable defect density. Here we report on an air-stable, solution-based chemical treatment by an organic superacid, which uniformly enhances the photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime of MoS2 monolayers by more than two orders of magnitude. The treatment eliminates defect-mediated nonradiative recombination, thus resulting in a final QY of more than 95%, with a longest-observed lifetime of 10.8 \u00b1 0.6 nanoseconds.

We find that intrinsic defects in MoS2 dominate the metal\/MoS2 contact resistance and provide a low Schottky barrier independent of metal contact work function. Furthermore, we show that MoS2 can exhibit both n-type and p-type conduction at different points on a same sample. We identify these regions independently by complementary characterization techniques and show how the Fermi level can shift by 1 eV over tens of nanometers in spatial resolution. We find that these variations in doping are defect-chemistry-related and are independent of contact metal. This raises questions on previous reports of metal-induced doping of MoS2 since the same metal in contact with MoS2 can exhibit both n- and p-type behavior.
