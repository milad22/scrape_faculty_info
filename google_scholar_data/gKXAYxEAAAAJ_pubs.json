We provide a simple construction of supersymmetric vacua, including some with orientifold descriptions. These vacua, which have warp factors, typically have fewer moduli than conventional Calabi-Yau compactifications. The mechanism for anomaly cancellation in the orientifold models involves background RR and NS fluxes. We consider in detail an orientifold of K3\u00d7 T 2 with background fluxes. After a combination of T and S-dualities, this type IIB orientifold is mapped to a compactification of the SO (32) heterotic string on a non-K\u00e4hler space with torsion.",

Microscopic considerations from string\/M-theory suggest two major innovations in the framework. First, the dependence of brane properties on the compactification of extra dimensions may generate a very small quantized unit for jumps in the effective cosmological term. Second, internal degrees of freedom for multiply coincident branes may enhance tunneling rates by exponentially large density of states factors. These new features essentially alter the relaxation dynamics. By requiring stability on the scale of the lifetime of the universe, rather than absolute stability, we derive a non-trivial relation between the supersymmetry breaking scale and the value of the cosmological term. It is plausibly, though not certainly, satisfied in Nature.",

In a number of situations, we can reduce the question of existence to quadrature, and the study of a particular limit of the propagator for the system of D-branes. This involves a derivation of an index theorem for a family of non-Fredholm operators. In support of the conjectured relation between compactified eleven-dimensional supergravity and Type IIA string theory, we show that a bound state exists for two coincident zero-branes. This result also provides support for the conjectured description of M-theory  as a matrix model.

We focus primarily, but not exclusively, on compactifications to seven or more dimensions. These vacua can be realized in a number ways: the perturbative constructions we study include toroidal compactifications of the heterotic\/type I strings, asymmetric orbifolds, and orientifolds. In addition, we describe less conventional M and F theory compactifications on smooth spaces. The last class of vacua considered are compactifications on singular spaces with non-trivial discrete fluxes.We find a number of new components in the string moduli space. Contained in some of these components are M theory compactifications with novel kinds of``frozen''singularities. We are naturally led to conjecture the existence of new dualities relating spaces with different singular geometries and fluxes. As our study of these vacua unfolds, we also learn about additional topics including: F theory on spaces without section, automorphisms of del Pezzo surfaces, and novel physics (and puzzles) from equivariant K-theory.

            "The matrix model formulation of M-theory can be generalized by compactification to ten-dimensional type II string theory, formulated in the infinite momentum frame. Both the type IIA and IIB string theories can be formulated in this way. In the M-theory and type IIA cases, the transverse rotational invariance is manifest, but in the IIB case, one of the transverse dimensions materializes in a completely different way from the other seven. The full O(8) rotational symmetry then follows in a surprising way from the electric-magnetic duality of supersymmetric Yang-Mills field theory.",

In the operator approach, we show that the free theory is essentially the unique abelian theory with up to four derivatives in the following sense: any small deformation of the free theory, which preserves the supersymmetries, can be gauged away by a unitary conjugation. We also present a method for deriving constraints on terms appearing in an effective Lagrangian. We apply this method to the effective Lagrangian describing the dynamics of two well-separated clusters of D0-branes. As a result, we prove a non-renormalization theorem for the \u03bd4 interaction.",
