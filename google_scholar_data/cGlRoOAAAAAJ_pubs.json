            "Using a plane-wave expansion method, we have solved Maxwell\u2019s equations for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a periodic lattice of dielectric spheres (dielectric constant \u03b5 a) in a uniform dielectric background (\u03b5 b). Contrary to experiment, we find that fcc dielectric structures do not have a \u2018\u2018photonic band gap\u2019\u2019that extends throughout the Brillouin zone. However, we have determined that dielectric spheres arranged in the diamond structure do possess a full photonic band gap. This gap exists for refractive-index contrasts as low as 2.",

Photonic crystals\u2014the optical analogues of electronic crystal\u2014provide a means for achieving these goals. Combinations of metallic and dielectric materials can be used to obtain the required three-dimensional periodic variations in dielectric constant, but dissipation due to free carrier absorption will limit application of such structures at the technologically useful infrared wavelengths 4.
