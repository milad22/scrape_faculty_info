In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect 1, 2 and topological insulators 3, 4, 5; it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices 6. Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom\u2019s intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba 7 and Dresselhaus 8 strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose\u2013Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers 9. Such coupling has not been realized \u2026",

However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation\u2014a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems 4, 5. The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments 6, 7, 8, 9 on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field.

At the highest energy scales known, the microscopic universe is governed by particles interacting with each other through the exchange of gauge bosons. At the largest length scales, our Universe is ruled by gravity, whose gauge structure suggests the existence of a particle\u2014the graviton\u2014that mediates the gravitational force. At the mesoscopic scale, solid-state systems are subjected to gauge fields of different nature: materials can be immersed in external electromagnetic fields, but they can also feature emerging gauge fields in their low-energy description. In this review, we focus on another kind of gauge field: those engineered in systems of ultracold neutral atoms. In these setups, atoms are suitably coupled to laser fields that generate effective gauge potentials in their description. Neutral atoms' feeling'laser-induced gauge potentials \u2026",

The spin and momentum decomposition of the dressed states reveals the strength of the effective vector potential, and our measurements agree quantitatively with a simple single-particle model.
