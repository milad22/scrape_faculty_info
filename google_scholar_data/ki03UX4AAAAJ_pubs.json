            "A unified shell-model description of nuclear deformation valid throughout the periodic table is presented. Microscopic calculations for the Zr and Mo isotopes are carried out in the frameworks of the shell model and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method, respectively, to study the shape transition in these nuclei. It is shown that deformation is produced by the isoscalar component of the neutron-proton (n\u2212 p) interaction in this region, as in the lighter (2 s, 1 d)-shell region. Deformation sets in when the T= 0 n\u2212 p interaction dominates over the sphericity-favoring pairing interaction between T= 1 pairs of nucleons. When shell effects are important, as for the light and medium-weight regions mentioned above, the simultaneous occupation of neutrons and protons of spin-orbit\" partner\" orbitals plays a crucial role in determining the onset of deformation. However, their effect is probably less important in the rare-earth and \u2026",

The article begins with a brief discussion of Richardson\u2019s early work, which demonstrated the exact solvability of the pure pairing model, and then shows how that work has evolved recently into a much richer class of exactly solvable models. The Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between these quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This analogy is then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit of the pure pairing Hamiltonian. Several applications to problems of relevance to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of confined systems are considered. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed in the context of these exactly solvable models include (i) the crossover from \u2026",

Furthermore, it is fully automated, facilitating its use in systematic investigations of large sets of nuclei throughout the periodic table. As a first application, we have carried out calculations using the Skyrme force SLy4 and volume pairing, with exact particle-number projection following application of the Lipkin-Nogami prescription.

            "Neutron-proton pairing correlations are studied within the context of two solvable models, one based on the algebra SO (5) and the other on the algebra SO (8). In both of these models, particles interact in L= 0 pairs only. Boson-mapping techniques are applied to these models and shown to provide a convenient methodological tool both for solving such problems and for gaining useful insight into general features of pairing. We first focus on the SO (5) model, which involves generalized T= 1 pairing. Neither boson mean-field methods nor fermion-pair approximations are able to describe in detail neutron-proton pairing in this model. The analysis suggests, however, that the boson Hamiltonian obtained from a mapping of the fermion Hamiltonian contains a pairing force between bosons, pointing to the importance of boson-boson (or equivalently four-fermion) correlations with isospin T= 0 and spin S= 0.
