            "Through the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes after host immunodepletion, it is possible to mediate objective cancer regression in human patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the generation of tumor-specific T cells in this mode of immunotherapy is often limiting. Here we report the ability to specifically confer tumor recognition by autologous lymphocytes from peripheral blood by using a retrovirus that encodes a T cell receptor. Adoptive transfer of these transduced cells in 15 patients resulted in durable engraftment at levels exceeding 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes for at least 2 months after the infusion. We observed high sustained levels of circulating, engineered cells at 1 year after infusion in two patients who both demonstrated objective regression of metastatic melanoma lesions. This study suggests the therapeutic potential of genetically engineered cells for the biologic therapy of cancer.",

Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor.

            "Tomotherapy, literally \u201cslice therapy,\u201d is a proposal for the delivery of radiation therapy with intensity\u2010modulated strips of radiation. The proposed method employs a linear accelerator, or another radiation\u2010emitting device, which would be mounted on a ring gantry like a CT scanner. The patient would move through the bore of the gantry simultaneously with gantry rotation. The intensity modulation would be performed by temporally modulated multiple independent leaves that open and close across the slit opening. At any given time, any leaf would be (1) closed, covering a portion of the slit, (2) open, allowing radiation through, or (3) changing between these states. This method would result in the delivery of highly conformal radiation. Overall treatment times should be comparable with contemporary treatment delivery times. The ring gantry would make it convenient to mount a narrow multisegmented megavoltage \u2026",

Purpose: We report the results of using autologous TILs plus high-dose bolus interleukin 2 (IL-2), with or without the concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide, in the treatment of 86 consecutive patients with metastatic melanoma. Methods: From May 1987 through December 1992, 86 patients (38 female and 48 male) with metastatic melanoma were treated (145 courses) with autologous TILs plus high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 (720 000 IU\/kg every 8 hours). TILs plus IL-2 were administered in two cycles separated by approximately 2 weeks. Two treatment cycles constituted one treatment course. Patients received a maximum of 15 doses of IL-2 per cycle given every \u2026",
