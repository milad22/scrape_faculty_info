            "We describe the data reduction algorithms for the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). These algorithms were based on extensive preflight testing and modeling of the Si: As (24 \u03bcm) and Ge: Ga (70 and 160 \u03bcm) arrays in MIPS and have been refined based on initial flight data. The behaviors we describe are typical of state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art infrared focal planes operated in the low backgrounds of space. The Ge arrays are bulk photoconductors and therefore show a variety of artifacts that must be removed to calibrate the data. The Si array, while better behaved than the Ge arrays, does show a handful of artifacts that must also be removed to calibrate the data. The data reduction to remove these effects is divided into three parts. The first part converts the nondestructively read data ramps into slopes while removing artifacts with time constants of the order of the exposure time. The second part calibrates the \u2026",

The etch rate decreases with increasing gas flow rate, increases with increasing power density, and goes through a maximum at a gas composition of 75:25 CCl2F2:O2 under our conditions. After etching at low\u2010power densities (0.56 W cm\u22122) and for high CCl2F2 ratios (19:1 to O2), carbon and chlorine could be detected in the GaAs to a depth of less than 15 \u00c5 by x\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under these conditions there was a Ga deficiency to a depth of \u223c100 \u00c5, which we ascribe to surface roughening and the preferential vaporization of As2O3 over Ga2O3.

Examining the cost\u2013production experience curves of Si, CdTe and CIGS PV suggests that a minimum market size of US $0.2\u20131 billion is required to incubate a new market entrant. Several markets requiring high specific power meet this threshold.
