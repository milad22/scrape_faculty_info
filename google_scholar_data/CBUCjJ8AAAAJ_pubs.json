            "Synchrotron radiation photoemission has been used to study the interaction of H2O with defective and nearly-perfect TiO2(110) surfaces at temperatures between 160 and 300 K. Ti3+ 3d defect sites are implicated in the adsorption process, and by tuning the photon energy to 47 eV we find that a resonant photoernission process gives an enhanced photoermission sensitivity to the 3d defect states. Defects are produced on TiO2(110) by annealing to 1000 K in UHV; subsequent exposure to 104 L O2 produces nearly perfect surfaces, based on the suppressed Ti3d emission. Both nearly perfect and defective surfaces give rise to dissociative adsorption of H2O at 300 K. The saturation coverages are near 0.1 ML, independent of the initial defect concentration; however, the rate of dissociative adsorption (sticking probability) is higher on defective surfaces. The enhanced sensitivity to the Ti3+ defect states has allowed \u2026",

            "The direct reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH is known to occur at several types of electrocatalysts including oxidized Cu electrodes. In this work, we examine the yield behavior of an electrodeposited cuprous oxide thin film and explore relationships between surface chemistry and reaction behavior relative to air-oxidized and anodized Cu electrodes. CH 3 OH yields (43 \u03bcmol cm\u2212 2 h\u2212 1) and Faradaic efficiencies (38%) observed at cuprous oxide electrodes were remarkably higher than air-oxidized or anodized Cu electrodes suggesting Cu (I) species may play a critical role in selectivity to CH 3 OH. Experimental results also show CH 3 OH yields are dynamic and the copper oxides are reduced to metallic Cu in a simultaneous process. Yield behavior is discussed in comparison with photoelectrochemical and hydrogenation reactions where the improved stability of Cu (I) species may allow continuous CH 3 OH generation.",

None of the faces exhibits an appreciable density of surface states in the bulk band gap, in disagreement with recent calculations for the Ti O 2 (001) surface by Kasowski and Tait. The atomic geometry of both perfect and defect surfaces is examined, and the incomplete screening of pairs of surface cations at defect sites is suggested to give rise to occupied band-gap surface states rather than the coordinative unsaturation of surface cations. Hydrogen-exposure experiments indicate that Ti O 2 surfaces may not interact as strongly with hydrogen as has been suggested.",

            "When clean, vacuum-fractured surfaces of BaTiO 3 are analyzed using ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS and XPS), more than one set of barium core levels is observed. Sputtering the surface with ions removes lower-binding-energy intensity within the barium line shapes in UPS spectra while little change is noted in XPS. Sputtering of the surface also causes band bending and the creation of band-gap surface states of Ti 3d character. From a comparison of UPS and XPS Ba 4d line shapes from a vacuum-fractured surface, the lower-binding-energy component is assigned to barium with 12-fold oxygen coordination representative of bulk stoichiometry; the higher-binding-energy intensity originates from undercoordinated barium in the region of the sample surface. Such a negative chemical shift of core levels with increased coordination has been observed in the oxidation of metallic barium as \u2026",

For both surfaces, angle-integrated ESD yields have been measured as a function of annealing temperature ranging from room temperature sputtered surfaces to 1200 K annealed surfaces. These measurements imply that the local geometry of the desorption site must be considered in order to adequately explain the observed ion yield variations. The ESD ion angular distribution (ESDIAD) patterns have been obtained after annealing in the temperature range 300\u20131200 K. These patterns show the presence of short-range structural order, even on highly defective, sputtered surfaces, and they are interpreted in terms of plausible models of surface structure.

Both nearly-perfect surfaces and surfaces containing point defects have been prepared, and the influence of O 2 and H 2 O on both types of surfaces has been investigated. Cation core-level spectra from cleaved surfaces exhibit complex structure. The surface electronic band structure is similar to that of the bulk; at room temperature, V 2 O 3 is metallic with the Fermi level E F lying within the overlapping V (3 d) a 1 g and e g \u03c0 conduction bands. A minimum in the density of states occurs between the V (3 d) and O (2 p) bands at 3 eV below E F. The O (2 p) valence band has a width of 5.5-6 eV. Surface defects produced by Ar+-ion bombardment are associated with O vacancies and a net charge transfer to V (3 d) levels. O 2 interacts strongly with both perfect surfaces and surface defects \u2026",
