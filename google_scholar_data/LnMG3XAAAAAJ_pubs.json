            "We consider all 1\/2 BPS excitations of AdS\u00d7 S configurations in both type-IIB string theory and M-theory. In the dual field theories these excitations are described by free fermions. Configurations which are dual to arbitrary droplets of free fermions in phase space correspond to smooth geometries with no horizons. In fact, the ten dimensional geometry contains a special two dimensional plane which can be identified with the phase space of the free fermion system. The topology of the resulting geometries depends only on the topology of the collection of droplets on this plane. These solutions also give a very explicit realization of the geometric transitions between branes and fluxes. We also describe all 1\/2 BPS excitations of plane wave geometries. The problem of finding the explicit geometries is reduced to solving a Laplace (or Toda) equation with simple boundary conditions. We present a large class of explicit \u2026",

These field theory deformations, sometimes called \u03b2 deformations, can be viewed as arising from a star product. Our method works for any theory that has a gravity dual with a U (1)\u00d7 U (1) global symmetry which is realized geometrically.

            " The D1\u2013D5 system is believed to have an \u201corbifold point\u201d in its moduli space where its low energy theory is a ?=4 supersymmetric sigma model with target space M  N \/S  N , where M is T 4 or K3. We study correlation functions of chiral operators in CFTs arising from such a theory. We construct a basic class of chiral operators from twist fields of the symmetric group and the generators of the superconformal algebra. We find explicitly the 3-point functions for these chiral fields at large N; these expressions are \u201cuniversal\u201d in that they are independent of the choice of M. We observe that the result is a significantly simpler expression than the corresponding expression for the bosonic theory based on the same orbifold target space.",
