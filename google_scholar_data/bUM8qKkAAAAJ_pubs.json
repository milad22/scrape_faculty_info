The magnetite crystals were all single magnetic domains, and the magnetization directions of small superparamagnetic crystals were constrained by magnetic interactions with larger crystals in the chains. Shape anisotropy was found to dominate magnetocrystalline anisotropy in elongated crystals. A coercive field between 300 and 450 oersted was determined for one chain.",

Features in these distributions are correlated with characteristic island morphologies. The mean dome cluster size increased and the onset of island dislocation was delayed as the growth temperature increased. At 600 C, very large hut clusters are formed. This behavior is attributed to strain-assisted alloying of the Ge clusters. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis confirms Si diffusion into the Ge clusters at 600 C. An atomistic elastic model supports the interpretation that alloying is driven by strain energy enhancement near the island perimeters.",

Applications involving electrostatic fields include p-n junctions and dopant profiles, piezoelectric fields and ferroelectrics, and charged defects and boundaries. Applications involving magnetic materials include hard magnets, thin films, and nanostructures, both man-made and naturally occurring.

By using tomographic and holographic methods in a transmission electron microscope, we show that the three-dimensional shapes of such nanocrystals can be defined, that the detailed morphologies of individual crystals from three bacterial strains differ, and that none uniquely match those reported from the Martian meteorite.

            "The mean inner potential of a solid is a fundamental property of the material and depends on both composition and structure. By using cleaved crystal wedges of known angle, combined with dogital recording of off-axis electron holograms and with theoretical calculations of dynamical effects, the mean inner potential of Si (9.26\u00b10.08 V), MgO (13.01\u00b10.08 V), GaAs (14.53\u00b10.17 V) and PbS (17.19\u00b10.12 V) is measured with high accuracy of about 1%. Dynamical contributions to the phase of the transmitted beam are found by Bloch wave calculations to be less than 5% when the crystal wedges are titled away from zone-axis orientations and from major Kikuchi bands. The accuracy of the present method is a factor of 3 better than previously achieved by reflection high-energy electron diffraction and electron interferometry. The major causes of uncertainty were specimen imperfections and errors in phase measurement \u2026",

            "A simple method is described for determination of the quantity t\/\u03bbi from off-axis electron holograms, where t is the local thickness and \u03bbi is the mean-free-path for inelastic scattering of high energy electrons. The method uses the energy-filtered amplitude reconstructed from a hologram and, when applied to samples with well characterized geometry, allows measurement of the inelastic mean-free-path. Measured values of 71 \u00b1 5 nm for MgO and 92 \u00b1 7 nm for Si for 100 keV beam energy compare favorably with calculated and experimental values from electron-energy-loss spectroscopy. Differences between the two techniques for determining t\/\u03bbi and the utility of the holographic method are briefly discussed.",
