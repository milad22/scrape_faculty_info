The flare peak represents the highest \u03b3-ray intensity ever recorded for this object. During the high state, extremely rapid \u03b3-ray variability was seen, including an increase of a factor of 2.6 in~ 8 hr, which strengthens the case for relativistic beaming. Coordinated multifrequency observations were carried out with Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA; or, Astro-D), Roentgen Satellite (ROSAT), and International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and from many ground-based observatories, covering most accessible wavelengths.

These represent an unbiased subsample of the original 132 since they were snapshots selected to fill random holes in the HST schedule. The exposure times ranged from a few hundred to \u223c1000 s, increasing with redshift. Most images were taken in the F702W filter; those already observed in F814W during Cycle 5 were reobserved in F606W to give broader wavelength coverage. The data were analyzed uniformly, and both statistical and systematic errors were estimated (the latter dominate). In   of the BL Lac images, host galaxies are detected, including nearly all for   (58 of 63).

We focus on data reduction and analysis, describing the procedures used to model the host galaxy surface brightness radial profiles. A total of 69 host galaxies were resolved out of 110 objects observed, including almost all sources at  . We classify them morphologically by fitting with either an exponential disk or a de Vaucouleurs profile; when one fit is preferred over the other, in 58 of 69 cases, it is invariably the elliptical morphology. This is a very strong result given the large number of BL Lac objects, the unprecedented spatial resolution, and the homogeneity of the data set. With the present reclassification of the host galaxy of 1418+546 as an elliptical, there remain no undisputed examples of a disk galaxy hosting a BL Lac nucleus. This implies that, at 99 \u2026",

            "We present the results of the multiwavelength campaigns on 3C 273 in 1993-1995. During the observations in late 1993, this quasar showed an increase of its flux for energies\u2265 100 MeV from about 2.1\u00d7 10-7 photons cm-2 s-1 to approximately 5.6\u00d7 10-7 photons cm-2 s-1 during a radio outburst at 14.5, 22, and 37 GHz. However, no one-to-one correlation of the \u03b3-ray radiation with any frequency could be found. The photon spectral index of the high-energy spectrum changed from \u0393 \u03b3=(3.20\u00b10.54) to \u0393 \u03b3=(2.20\u00b10.22) in the sense that the spectrum flattened when the \u03b3-ray flux increased. Fits of the three most prominent models (synchrotron self-Comptonization, external inverse Comptonization, and the proton-initiated cascade model) for the explanation of the high \u03b3-ray emission of active galactic nuclei were performed to the multiwavelength spectrum of 3C 273. All three models are able to represent the basic \u2026",

The ASCA spectra of both sources can be described as a first approximation by a power law with photon index \u0393~ 2. This is flatter than for most X-ray-selected BL Lacs observed with ASCA, in agreement with the predictions of current blazar unification models. While 1749+ 096 exhibits tentative evidence for spectral flattening at low energies, a concave continuum is detected for 2200+ 420: the steep low-energy component is consistent with the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission responsible for the longer wavelengths, while the harder tail at higher energies is the onset of the Compton component. The two BL Lacs were observed with ground-based telescopes from radio to TeV energies contemporaneously with ASCA \u2026",

            " We report the detection at X\u2010rays of the radio\/optical jet of 3C 371 from a short (10 ks) Chandra exposure in 2000 March. We also present a new MERLIN observation at 1.4 GHz together with a reanalysis of the archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 F555W image. Despite the limited signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio of the Chandra data, the X\u2010ray morphology is clearly different from that of the radio\/optical emission, with the brightest X\u2010ray knot at 1 7 from the nucleus and little X\u2010ray emission from the brightest radio\/optical knot at 3 1. We construct the spectral energy distributions for the two emission regions at 1 7 and 3 1. Both show that the X\u2010ray flux is below the extrapolation from the radio\u2010to\u2010optical continuum, suggesting a moderately beamed synchrotron from an electron population with a decreasing high\u2010energy cutoff as a plausible emission mechanism.",
