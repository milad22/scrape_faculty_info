The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to \u2026",

Large-scale functional genomics data often fail to connect to standard experimental approaches of gene characterization in individual laboratories. Furthermore, a lack of universal annotation standards for phenotypic data sets makes it difficult to compare different screening approaches. Here we address this problem in a screen designed to identify all genes required for the first two rounds of cell division in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We used RNA-mediated interference to target 98% of all genes predicted in the C. elegans genome in combination with differential interference contrast time-lapse microscopy.

The simultaneous disruption ofELO2 and ELO3 has also been shown to produce synthetic lethality, indicating that they have related and\/or overlapping functions. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography\/mass spectroscopy analyses reveal that null mutations of ELO2and ELO3 produce defects in the formation of very long chain fatty acids.

            "The unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) requiring ole1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to produce a defective \u0394-9 fatty acid desaturase. This enzyme catalyzes double bond formation between carbons 9 and 10 of palmitoyl and stearoyl coenzyme A. A DNA fragment isolated by complementation of an ole1 strain repairs the ufa requirement in mutant cells. Genetic analysis of the cloned DNA fragment indicates that it is allelic to the OLE1 gene. Disruption of a single copy of the wild type gene in a diploid strain produces both wild type and nonreverting ufa-requiring haploid progeny upon sporulation. Membrane lipids of the disrupted haploid strains contain only ufas supplied in the growth medium. The recovery of activity in both wild type and disrupted segregants was examined after removal of ufas from the growth medium. Following ufa deprivation disruptant cells grew normally for about three generations and \u2026",
