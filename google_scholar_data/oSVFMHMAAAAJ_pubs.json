Over a range of conditions, the main components detected in the initial surface films were lithium alkyl carbonates. Another alkyl carbonate solvent, diethyl carbonate, was found to react with lithium to form lithium ethyl carbonate,. In addition to solvent reduction, XPS measurements gave indication of salt reduction reactions.,, and were reduced by lithium to form halide ions, which were detected on the lithium surface. Two possible mechanisms for the formation of alkyl carbonates are discussed. One is the nucleophilic reaction of propylene carbonate with basic species such as OH\u2212, while the other involves one\u2010electron reduction of propylene carbonate by lithium metal, followed by free radical termination reactions. When high concentrations of water were present, lithium carbonate was formed by further \u2026",

The electrode metals included polycrystalline gold and silver. Various techniques including cyclic voltammetry, FTIR and XPS were used to characterize the main electrochemical reactions that occur in these systems. Several separate film forming processes have been identified, including reduction of solvent, the salt, and traces of oxygen and water. The surface films formed in these processes lead to the apparent stability of these systems at low potentials. Li UPD was also examined and was found to be controlled by the nature of the surface films through which lithium is deposited.",

            "Calculations based on the classical Fresnel equations have been carried out to investigate the effect of various experimental parameters on infrared spectra obtained for molecules adsorbed at the electrode\/solution interface. The effects considered include the nature of window material, the variation in the angle of incidence, the incident beam diameter, the instrument focus, and the presence of an absorbing bulk electrolyte solution. It is shown that, under certain circumstances, the resultant spectra are enhanced with respect to those obtained in the absence of an IR window and bulk adsorbing phase. The significance of the present results with respect to practical experiments is discussed.",

Subtractively normalized interfacial FTIR spectra (SNIFTIRS) indicated only weak adsorption of bisulfate at potentials below 0.4 V (vs.), in contrast to the strong adsorption seen on the (111) surface by the same technique. At potentials above 0.6 V the SNIFTIRS spectra were due entirely to diffuse layer species. At potentials between 0.4 and 0.6 V, changes in the IR bands indicated either a rearrangement (and possibly deprotonation) of adsorbed bisulfate or weak adsorption of sulfate ion.",

The effect of the electrolyte on the C\u2014H stretching and deformation modes together with new information on the CN and C\u2014C stretching modes is analysed in detail. It is shown on the basis of spectra obtained in the deuteriated acetonitrile that the Cl\u2014O symmetrical stretching vibration (\u03bd1) is IR active when the anion is paired to a cation. Analysis of the perchlorate region of the spectrum provided further information on ion pairing in this system.",
