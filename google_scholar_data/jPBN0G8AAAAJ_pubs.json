            "Cerebral hypothermia can improve outcome of experimental perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia. We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to find out if delayed head cooling can improve neurodevelopmental outcome in babies with neonatal encephalopathy.234 term infants with moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy and abnormal amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) were randomly assigned to either head cooling for 72 h, within 6 h of birth, with rectal temperature maintained at 34\u201335\u00b0C (n=116), or conventional care (n=118). Primary outcome was death or severe disability at 18 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. We examined in two predefined subgroup analyses the effect of hypothermia in babies with the most severe aEEG changes before randomisation\u2014ie, severe loss of background amplitude, and seizures\u2014and those with less severe changes \u2026",

In recent years, a population of CD4+ T cells that constitutively express the interleukin-2 receptor-\u03b1 chain, CD25, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the maintenance of self-tolerance in rodent models. This study investigated whether such a regulatory population exists in humans. A population of CD4+CD25+ T cells, taken from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and phenotypically distinct from recently activated CD4+ T cells, was characterized. These cells were hyporesponsive to conventional T-cell stimuli and capable of suppressing the responses of CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells in vitro. Addition of exogenous interleukin-2 abrogated the hyporesponsiveness and suppressive effects of CD4+CD25+ cells. Suppression required cell-to-cell contact but did not appear to be \u2026",

A new method is described in which the effect of a small change (5-10%) in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) on cerebral oxyhemoglobin [HbO2] and deoxyhemoglobin [Hb] concentration is observed by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Previous experiments in which the NIR absorption characteristics of HbO2 and Hb and the pathlength of NIR light through the brain were defined allowed changes in [HbO2] and [Hb] to be quantified from the Beer-Lambert law. It is shown here that CBV can then be derived from the expression CBV = (delta[HbO2] - delta[Hb])\/(2. delta SaO2.H.R.), where H is the large vessel total hemoglobin concentration and R to the cerebral-to-large vessel hematocrit ratio.
