            "We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and \u2026",

This provides a mean-field picture of strongly corrrelated systems, which becomes exact as d\u2192\u221e. We point out a special integrable case of the mean-field equations, and study the general case using a perturbative renormalization group around the atomic limit. Three distinct Fermi-liquid regimes arise, corresponding to the Kondo, mixed-valence, and empty-orbitals regimes of the single-impurity problem. The Kondo resonance and the satellite peaks of the single-impurity model correspond to the quasiparticle and Hubbard-bands features of the Hubbard model, respectively.",

They all share the same basic building blocks, but there is significant variation in their physical properties, such as magnetic ordered moments, effective masses, superconducting gaps and transition temperature (T c). Many theoretical techniques have been applied to individual compounds but no consistent description of the microscopic origin of these variations is available 2. Here we carry out a comparative theoretical study of a large number of iron-based compounds in both their magnetic and paramagnetic states. Taking into account correlation effects and realistic band structures, we describe well the trends in all of the physical properties such as the ordered moments, effective masses and Fermi surfaces across all families of iron compounds, and find them to \u2026",
