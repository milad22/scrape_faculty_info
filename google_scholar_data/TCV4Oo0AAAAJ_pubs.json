            "Litter accumulates on the forest floor in Pinus patula Schlechtd. et Cham. plantations in Mpumalanga, South Africa especially in high altitude sites, as a result of an imbalance between litter production and decomposition. To determine which factor caused this increase we measured litter production in an age series of P. patula growing at low and high altitude sites. Litter production was shown to increase with increasing stand. The average annual litter production figure ranged from 3.64 to 5.89 t ha-1 yr-1 measured over a two-year period, with maximum litterfall occurring from mid-winter to early spring. Litter accumulation, as measured by litter depth, ranged from 39 to 121 mm. No significant relationship existed between litter production and altitude; however, litter accumulation was shown to increase with increasing stand age and increasing altitude. Increased litter production was, therefore, not responsible \u2026",

            "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form widespread symbiotic associations with 80% of known land plants. They play a major role in plant nutrition, growth, water absorption, nutrient cycling and protection from pathogens, and as a result, contribute to ecosystem processes. Salinity stress conditions undoubtedly limit plant productivity and, therefore, the role of AMF as a biological tool for improving plant salt stress tolerance, is gaining economic importance worldwide. However, this approach requires a better understanding of how plants and AMF intimately interact with each other in saline environments and how this interaction leads to physiological changes in plants. This knowledge is important to develop sustainable strategies for successful utilization of AMF to improve plant health under a variety of stress conditions.

An adapted method for baiting soil samples with key citrus pest Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick; Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann; Diptera: Tephritidae) larvae, as well as with the standard bait insect, Galleria mellonella (Linnaeus; Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was implemented. Sixty-two potentially useful entomopathogenic fungal isolates belonging to four genera were collected from 288 soil samples, an occurrence frequency of 21.53%. The most frequently isolated entomopathogenic fungal species was Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (15.63%), followed by Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin (3.82%).

            " Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is an invasive parasite species in populations of honey bees, Apis mellifera L. Aiming toward substitution of chemical control, we here identified a naturally occurring fungal pathogen of adult A. tumida from its endemic range in South Africa [Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin variety anisopliae strain FI-203]. The susceptibility of adult beetles (n = 400) to this fungus and to three other generalist entomopathogenic fungal isolates [Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, and Hirsutella illustris Minter & Brady] was assessed using spore suspension bioassays. The data revealed significantly increased mortality in the B. bassiana (74.00 \u00b1 8.94%) and M. anisopliae variety anisopliae (28.00 \u00b1 16.43%) tests but not in the H. illustris (2.00 \u00b1 4.47%) and M. anisopliae (12.00 \u00b1 8.37%) groups.

Experimental treatments involving nitrate supply and chilling stress have been shown to affect fluorescence induction curves and other measures of photosynthesis. We have investigated the photosynthetic performance of Sorghum bicolor supplied with Long Ashton growth solution containing standard (20 mmol mol-1) or low (5 mmol mol-1) phosphorus. The JIP-test based on the chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve was used as a non-destructive method to measure the relative proportions of energy dissipated by different processes (termed energy fluxes) in the light reactions. The various energy fluxes or derived parameters were compared to find the measures that were most sensitive to the experimental conditions.

Results showed that increasing salt levels caused a significant reduction in survival (%), growth parameters, leaf relative water content (LRWC) (%), and chlorophyll content with an increase in electrolyte leakage (%) and lipid peroxidation of membranes of Jatropha. AM inoculation improved biomass yields as well as other physiological parameters (LRWC (%), chlorophyll, proline, and soluble sugar) of salt-stressed Jatropha over noninoculated plants. Tolerance index of Jatropha was higher with AM fungi than without at all salt levels; however, a decline in its value was recorded with increased salinity levels.
