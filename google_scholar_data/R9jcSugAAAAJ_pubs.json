By changing the rate of the rotation during each revolution, we can fabricate nano-columns with circular, elliptical, triangle, rectangular, and pentagon shapes. Depending on the nucleation sites, we can even fabricate flowerlike nano-columns. This method has potential application to produce 3-D lattice. ",

By rotating the substrate in both polar and azimuthal directions, one can fabricate desired nanostructures, such as nano-rod arrays with different shapes, nano-spring arrays, and even multilayer nanostructures. This method offers a fully three-dimensional control of the nanostructure with additional capability of self-alignment.

            "Electron field emission is a quantum tunneling phenomenon whereby electrons are emitted from a solid surface due to a strong electric field. Graphene and its derivatives are expected to be efficient field emitters due to their unique geometry and electrical properties. So far, electron field emission has only been achieved from the edges of graphene and graphene oxide sheets. We have supported graphene oxide sheets on nickel nanotip arrays to produce a high density of sharp protrusions within the sheets and then applied electric fields perpendicular to the sheets. Highly efficient and stable field emission with low turn-on fields was observed for these graphene oxide sheets, because the protrusions appear to locally enhance the electric field and dramatically increase field emission. Our simple and robust approach provides prospects for the development of practical electron sources and advanced devices based \u2026",

During the oblique-angle deposition, both \u03b2-phase W(100) and \u03b1-phase W(110) islands exist at the initial stages of growth. The \u03b2-phase W(100) islands grow taller due to the lower adatom mobility on these islands. The taller islands survive in the competition and form isolated nanorods in the later stages of growth. This is in contrast to the sputter deposition at normal incidence, where only the thermodynamically stable bcc \u03b1-phase W(110) polycrystalline films were formed when the film grows to a certain thickness.",

The tilt angle of slanted nano-rods is determined by the incident angle of deposition flux and the azimuthal swing rotation angle of a substrate. The controlled substrate rotation affects the uniformity and the shape of the nanostructures. On the patterned substrate, the broadening of the size of individual nano-columns is greatly reduced and the nano-columns are not connected as they grow.
