            "Observations of the high-redshift Universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation. Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z\u223c 50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift \u2026",

However, the most stringent constraints on its duration have come from the integrated optical depth, \u03c4, of Thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background.

One of the major outstanding questions is how this event proceeds on large scales. Motivated by numerical simulations, we develop a model for the growth of H ii regions during the reionization era. We associate ionized regions with large\u2010scale density fluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size distribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of ionized regions. We show how to construct the power spectrum of fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from the H ii regions that should be observable with the next generation of low\u2010frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission from the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions \u2026",

The UDF12 campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance, luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forming galaxies.

Although the physical processes are treated with approximate methods, we compare our results to a state-of-the-art large-scale hydrodynamic simulation, and find good agreement on scales pertinent to the upcoming observations (\u22731 Mpc). The power spectra from 21cmfast agree with those generated from the numerical simulation to within 10s of per cent, down to the Nyquist frequency.

Here we show that the evolution of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts can be measured statistically using fluctuations in 21 cm radiation from neutral hydrogen. By analogy with the mathematical description of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, we develop a formalism to quantify the variations in 21 cm emission as a function of both frequency and angular scale.

The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three\u2010dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three\u2010dimensional 21 cm power spectrum.

            "Detailed theoretical studies of the high\u2010redshift universe, and especially reionization, are generally forced to rely on time\u2010consuming N\u2010body codes and\/or radiative transfer algorithms. We present a method to construct seminumerical \u201csimulations,\u201d which can efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion\u2010set approach with first\u2010order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N\u2010body codes by orders of magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor, because ionized regions reach scales of tens of comoving Mpc. We test our halo\u2010finding and ionization\u2010mapping algorithms separately against N\u2010body simulations \u2026",
