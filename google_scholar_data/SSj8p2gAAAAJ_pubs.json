            "Theoretical analysis of the gain and threshold current of a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) laser is given which takes account of the line broadening caused by fluctuations in quantum dot sizes. The following processes are taken into consideration together with the main process of radiative recombination of carriers in QDs: band-to-band radiative recombination of carriers in the waveguide region, carrier capture into QDs and thermally excited escape from QDs, photoexcitation of carriers from QDs to continuous-spectrum states. For an arbitrary QD size distribution, expressions for the threshold current density as a function of the root mean square of relative QD size fluctuations, total losses in the waveguide region, surface density of QDs and thickness of the waveguide region have been obtained in an explicit form.

Our approach is based on direct injection of carriers into the QDs, resulting in a strong depletion of minority carriers in the regions outside the QDs. Recombination in these regions, which is the dominant source of the temperature dependence, is thereby suppressed, raising the characteristic temperature T\/sub 0\/ above 1500 K. Still further enhancement of T\/sub 0\/ results from the resonant nature of tunneling injection, which reduces the inhomogeneous line broadening by selectively cutting off the nonlasing QDs.",

Together with the spontaneous radiative recombination, the Auger recombination and the lateral diffusive leakage of carriers from the active region are included into the model. A first-principle calculation of the Auger recombination current is performed. It is shown that the lateral diffusive leakage current is controlled by the radiative and Auger currents. When calculating the carrier densities, the electrons in the barrier regions are properly taken into account. Redistribution of electrons over the active region is shown to increase the threshold current considerably.

            "We discuss in detail a new mechanism of nonlinearity of the light-current characteristic (LCC) in heterostructure lasers with reduced-dimensionality active regions, such as quantum wells (QWs), quantum wires (QWRs), and quantum dots (QDs). It arises from: 1) noninstantaneous carrier capture into the quantum-confined active region and 2) nonlinear (in the carrier density) recombination rate outside the active region. Because of 1), the carrier density outside the active region rises with injection current, even above threshold, and because of 2), the useful fraction of current (that ends up as output light) decreases. We derive a universal closed-form expression for the internal differential quantum efficiency \/spl eta\/\/sub int\/ that holds true for QD, QWR, and QW lasers. This expression directly relates the power and threshold characteristics. The key parameter, controlling \/spl eta\/\/sub int\/ and limiting both the output power \u2026",
