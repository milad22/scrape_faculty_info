            "In 2004, the Italian Parliament enacted a law regulating medically assisted reproduction. Although the law recognizes as legal certain assisted reproduction techniques, several other procedures are implicitly or expressly banned: oocyte and sperm donation, using embryos for the scientific research purposes and reproductive cloning. In this article, I outline the new legal framework, pointing out some of the shortcomings of its provisions, such as the failure to define what an \u2018embryo\u2019 is, the contradictions between this law and the law on abortion, the opportunity for Italian couples to circumvent some of the prohibitions by resorting to \u2018reproductive tourism\u2019, and the central role that physicians play in the new legal framework.",

This paper presents the findings of an empirical study investigating basic scientists\u2019 attitudes toward publicly funded basic research at the Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutions. The study finds that scientists at the Harvard Medical School construe publicly funded basic research as inquiries that, whether use oriented or not, must be governed by the cognitive and social norms of the traditional mode of knowledge production (mode 1 paradigm). They recognize that academic science is vulnerable to access by external capital but maintain that it remains distinct from research done in the private sector. Overall, the study demonstrates that important segments of academia have preserved a traditional approach to knowledge production, which is yet to be transformed by the entrepreneurial turn.",

More specifically, banking human tissue raises issues relating to the ownership of the samples that the participants have donated, to the ownership of the data that are derived through processing the donated samples, and to the management arrangements that better balance the interest of genetic research with the protection of participants' rights. Winickoff & Winickoff suggest that the charitable-trust model is a superior legal arrangement for biobanking compared with private biobanking. This paper critically assesses Winickoff & Winickoff's claim by highlighting some areas of implementation where such a model could be problematic.

            "Ownership rights regarding genetic material are controversial. New developments in genetic research and biotechnology have certainly revived the traditional debate on body ownership and its commodification (Charo 2006). While a few drops of blood are themselves of little scientific or economic value, a collection of biological material from a well documented cohort of donors has an aggregate, scientific and economic value that a sample alone does not possess. Indeed, the value is even greater if linked to medical records and other data regarding the donor of the sample sources are linked to the material. Therefore, biobanking gives value to goods that perse amount to little worth, and that produces contested ownership rights. Biobanking involves balancing the sometimes conflicting interests of different stakeholders: donors\/research participants, biobankers, investigators, and the public. Ownership is one of the areas in which the balancing of interests is particularly problematic around at least two sets of stakeholders\u2019 interests that are in tension. The first tension arises between research participants and biobankers. Part of the tension arises because of the inconsistent way legal interests in the human body are characterized when possessed by individuals (in their own body) as opposed to when possessed by a third party outside the body. Typically, individuals participate in biomedical research for altruistic reasons, and any biological material taken from them is treated as a donation. Legally, that entails the donor having no claim to the biological material after it is donated. Once biobanks collect, store, and organize the donated material \u2026",

Although consensus exists on few issues and solutions, our conclusion is that existing policies do not address in sufficient detail, or do not agree on, a number of important issues raised by biobanking activities.
