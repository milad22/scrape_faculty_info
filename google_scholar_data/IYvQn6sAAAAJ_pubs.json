            "Several small-band-gap semiconductors are now known to protect metallic surface states as a consequence of the topology of the bulk electron wave functions. The known \u201ctopological insulators\u201d with this behavior include the important thermoelectric materials Bi 2 Te 3 and Bi 2 Se 3, whose surfaces are observed in photoemission experiments to have an unusual electronic structure with a single Dirac cone. We study in-plane (ie, horizontal) transport in thin films made of these materials. The surface states from top and bottom surfaces hybridize, and conventional diffusive transport predicts that the tunable hybridization-induced band gap leads to increased thermoelectric performance at low temperatures. Beyond simple diffusive transport, the conductivity shows a crossover from the spin-orbit-induced antilocalization at a single surface to ordinary localization.",

            "Superconductivity in so-called unconventional superconductors is nearly always found in the vicinity of another ordered state, such as antiferromagnetism, charge density wave (CDW), or stripe order. This suggests a fundamental connection between superconductivity and fluctuations in some other order parameter. To better understand this connection, we used high-pressure X-ray scattering to directly study the CDW order in the layered dichalcogenide TiSe 2, which was previously shown to exhibit superconductivity when the CDW is suppressed by pressure 1 or intercalation of Cu atoms 2. We succeeded in suppressing the CDW fully to zero temperature, establishing for the first time the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) at P c= 5.1\u00b10.2 GPa, which is more than 1 GPa beyond the end of the superconducting region. Unexpectedly, at P= 3 GPa we observed a reentrant, weakly first order, incommensurate \u2026",

            "Recent experiments have observed bulk superconductivity in doped topological insulators. Here we ask whether vortex Majorana zero modes, previously predicted to occur when s-wave superconductivity is induced on the surface of topological insulators, survive in these doped systems with metallic normal states. Assuming inversion symmetry, we find that they do but only below a critical doping. The critical doping is tied to a topological phase transition of the vortex line, at which it supports gapless excitations along its length. The critical point depends only on the vortex orientation and a suitably defined SU (2) Berry phase of the normal state Fermi surface. By calculating this phase for available band structures we determine that superconducting p-doped Bi 2 Te 3, among others, supports vortex end Majorana modes. Surprisingly, superconductors derived from topologically trivial band structures can support \u2026",

The strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields are oppositely oriented in the two valleys and can be as large as 60\u2013300 T as reported in recent experiments. For strained graphene at neutrality, a spin-or a valley-polarized state is predicted depending on the value of the on-site Coulomb interaction. At fractional filling, the unscreened Coulomb interaction leads to a valley-polarized fractional quantum Hall liquid which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. Motivated by artificial graphene systems, we consider tuning the short-range part of interactions and demonstrate that exotic valley symmetric states, including a valley fractional topological insulator and a spin triplet superconductor, can be stabilized by such interaction engineering.",

Moreover, a sudden low temperature upturn in the amplitude of the oscillations raises the possibility of quantum criticality. Here we discuss recently proposed mechanisms for this effect, contrasting bulk and surface scenarios. We argue that topological surface states permit us to reconcile the various data with bulk transport and spectroscopy measurements, interpreting the low temperature upturn in the quantum oscillation amplitudes as a result of surface Kondo breakdown and the high frequency oscillations as large topologically protected orbits around the X point. We discuss various predictions that can be used to test this theory.",

Verifying such a pairing symmetry requires a special phase-sensitive probe that is also momentum selective. We show that the sign structure of s\u00b1pairing can lead to surface Andreev bound states (ABS) at the sample edge. In the clean limit they only occur when the edge is along the nearest neighbor Fe-Fe bond, but not for a diagonal edge or a surface orthogonal to the c axis. In contrast to d-wave ABS, they are not at zero energy and, in general, do not produce a zero bias tunneling peak. Consequences for tunneling measurements are derived, within a simplified two-band model and also for a more realistic five-band model. In both cases, surface ABS are obtained.",

At T> 0, we show that while correlation functions of certain operators exhibit \u03c9\u2215 T scaling, they do not show analogous scaling in space. In particular, in the scaling limit, all such correlators are purely local in space, although the same correlators at T= 0 decay as a power law. This provides a valuable microscopic example of a certain kind of local quantum criticality. The local form of the correlations arises from the large density of soft modes present near the transition that are excited by temperature.

More generally, the behavior of the universal scaling function that collapses the temperature-and pressure-dependent resistivity is derived, and is shown to bear a strong imprint of the emergent gauge fluctuations.
