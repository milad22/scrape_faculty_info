Methadone has traditionally been the mainstay drug used in the management of opioid-dependent individuals. Buprenorphine has been reported as an alternative to methadone.ObjectivesThe primary objective of this assessment report was to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT) and methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for the management of opioid-dependent individuals from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS).",

We present findings from comprehensive, systematic literature reviews, and new analyses of published and unpublished data, to establish the effect of stillbirth on parents, families, health-care providers, and societies worldwide.

Indirect and intangible costs of stillbirth are extensive and are usually met by families alone. This issue is particularly onerous for those with few resources.

It is one of a range of techniques used in screening and diagnosis, but it differs from most others because of the direct access that it gives parents to images of the fetus. A review of women's views of ultrasound was commissioned as part of a larger study of the clinical and economic aspects of routine antenatal ultrasound use.Methods: Studies of women's views about antenatal screening and diagnosis were searched for on electronic databases. Studies about pregnancy ultrasound were then identified from this material. Further studies were found by contacting researchers, hand searches, and following up references.

It is a heterogeneous condition where 30-40 per cent of all cases of preterm births are the result of elective delivery for a maternal or a fetal complication. The remaining 60-70 per cent of preterm births occur spontaneously, and these are the focus of this report. Preterm birth complicates about 3 per cent of pregnancies before 34 weeks\u2019 gestation and between 7 and 12 per cent before 37 weeks\u2019 gestation. The former particularly has serious effects on mother, child and society, making preterm birth an important issue to public health worldwide. If women can be identified to be at high risk in early pregnancy, they can be targeted for more intensive antenatal surveillance and prophylactic interventions.

Breast cancer screening has led to a large increase in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnoses. This is a widely heterogeneous disease and most DCIS detected through screening is of high cytonuclear grade and therefore likely to be important clinically.

METHODS: Linked studies around a cross-sectional population-based survey of adult men and women invited to collect urine and (for women) vulvovaginal swab specimens at home and mail these to a laboratory for testing for Chlamydia trachomatis. Specimens were used in laboratory evaluations of an amplified enzyme immunoassay (PCE EIA) and two nucleic acid amplification tests [Cobas polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Becton Dickinson strand displacement amplification (SDA)]. Chlamydia-positive cases and two negative controls completed a risk factor questionnaire. Chlamydia-positive cases were invited into a randomised controlled trial of partner notification strategies. Samples of individuals testing negative completed psychological questionnaires before and after screening. In-depth interviews were conducted at all stages of screening. Chlamydia transmission and cost-effectiveness of screening were investigated in a transmission dynamic model. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: General population in the Bristol and Birmingham areas of England. In total, 19,773 women and men aged 16-39 years were randomly selected from 27 general practice lists. RESULTS: Screening invitations reached 73%(14,382\/19,773). Uptake (4731 participants), weighted for sampling, was 39.5%(95% CI 37.7, 40.8%) in women and 29.5%(95% CI 28.0, 31.0%) in men aged 16-39 years.

            "BackgroundCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common group of congenital malformations and one of the leading causes of infant death in the developed world. Early detection of major CHDs\u2013which cause death or require invasive intervention before 1 year of age\u2013may improve outcome. Current routine screening for CHDs relies on a mid-trimester anomaly ultrasound scan in pregnant women, involving imaging of the heart chambers, and a postnatal clinical examination involving assessment of the cardiovascular system. Both of these have a relatively low detection rate and a number of babies are discharged from hospital before a CHD is diagnosed. A proportion of these may die or present in such a poor clinical condition that the outcome, despite treatment, is compromised.",
