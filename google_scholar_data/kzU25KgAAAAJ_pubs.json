            "Different stoichiometric configurations of graphane and graphene fluoride are investigated within density-functional theory. Their structural and electronic properties are compared, and we indicate the similarities and differences among the various configurations. Large differences between graphane and graphene fluoride are found that are caused by the presence of charges on the fluorine atoms. A configuration that is more stable than the boat configuration is predicted for graphene fluoride. We also perform GW calculations for the electronic band gap of both graphene derivatives. These band gaps and also the calculated Young\u2019s moduli are at variance with available experimental data. This might indicate that the experimental samples contain a large number of defects or are only partially covered with H or F.",

On the opposite end of transistor applications is power electronics for which transistors capable of switching very high voltages are necessary. Miniaturization of energy-efficient power switches can enable the integration with various electronic systems and lead to substantial boosts in energy efficiency. Nanotechnology is yet to have an impact in this arena. In this work, it is demonstrated that nanomembranes of the wide-bandgap semiconductor gallium oxide can be used as channels of transistors capable of switching high voltages, and at the same time can be integrated on any platform. The findings mark a step towards using lessons learnt in nanomaterials and nanotechnology to address a challenge that yet remains \u2026",

We find that cation vacancies have high formation energies in SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 even in the most favorable conditions. Their formation energies are significantly lower in \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3. Cation vacancies, which are compensating acceptors, strongly interact with H impurities resulting in complexes with low formation energies and large binding energies, stable up to temperatures over 730 C. Our results indicate that hydrogen has beneficial effects on the conductivity of transparent conducting oxides: it increases the carrier concentration by acting as a donor in the form of isolated interstitials, and by passivating compensating acceptors such as cation vacancies; in addition, it potentially enhances carrier mobility by reducing the \u2026",

Using first-principles calculations we trace the evolution of the band structure as a function of the number of layers, starting from a monolayer, which has a direct gap, to the bulk material, which has an indirect gap. We find that, with respect to the vacuum level, the valence-band maximum (VBM) increases rapidly with the number of layers, while the conduction-band minimum (CBM) remains almost constant. For two or more layers the VBM always occurs at \u0393 and the CBM occurs at K. These findings are analyzed in terms of the orbital composition of the valence-and conduction-band edges at the various high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone.",

We found that the B and P dopants will migrate to the edge of the wire and that the formation energy for codoping is smaller than that for the single doped cases. In ultrathin wires it is possible to have a larger number of dangling bonds than dopant atoms per unit length; the effect of these defects on the formation and segregation energy is substantial.

The dielectric function shows an anomalous dependence on the layer number. It decreases with the layer number increasing when the films are less than 5\u20137 layers thick but turns to increase with the layer number for thicker films. We show that this is because the excitonic effect is very strong in the thin MoS 2 films and its contribution to the dielectric function may dominate over the contribution of the band structure. We also extract the value of layer-dependent exciton binding energy and Bohr radius in the films by fitting the experimental results with an intuitive model.
