            "A large number of studies have attempted to identify factors that are                         correlated with exporting success. However, much controversy exists about                         the key determinants of export performance and their relative importance. A                         major reason for this lack of consensus is the absence of a unified measure                         for capturing export performance. In this study, an attempt is made to                         develop a generalized export performance measure, the EXPERF scale, that can                         be applied to multiple countries. Results from a survey of top executives of                         U.S. and Japanese exporters support a three-dimensional scale for measuring                         export performance. The three dimensions of the export performance (EXPERF)                         scale are financial export performance, strategic export performance, and                         satisfaction with export venture \u2026",

Their affluence, high education, and work ethic position them as a \u201cmodel minority.\u201d However complimentary that term may seem, it nonetheless represents a stereotype whose prevalence must be documented to examine the intersection of minority status and gender in mass media portrayals. The authors report a content analysis of more than 1300 prime time television advertisements conducted to assess the frequency and nature of Asian-American representation. They found that Asian male and female models are overrepresented in terms of proportion of the population (3.6%), appearing in 8.4% of the commercials. However, Asian models are more likely than members of other minority groups to appear in background roles, and Asian women are rarely depicted in major roles. Further, the findings indicate that portrayals of Asian-Americans put so much emphasis on \u2026",

This paper also surveys four earlier reviews of the international advertising literature and assesses whether issues posed in the reviews have been adequately addressed. A new agenda for international advertising researchers is offered, consisting of eight research questions and some admonitions relating to data collection and collaboration among researchers.

            "Selecting a mode for entering or expanding in a foreign market is a crucial strategic decision for an international firm. This article identifies and compares the most influential factors that affect the international modes of entry and expansion decisions of US and Japanese firms. Using mail surveys, this is one of the first studies on this subject to collect data from top executives in both Japan and the USA. Findings reveal that the Japanese are particularly sensitive to external risk and other target market factors. For Americans, company factors, such as international experience, appear to be most important when selecting modes of entry. Joint ventures may be more appropriate for internationally\u2010experienced firms, than for inexperienced companies.",
