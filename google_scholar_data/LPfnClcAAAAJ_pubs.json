            "To rationally design a productive heterologous biosynthesis system, it is essential to consider the suitability of foreign reactions for the specific endogenous metabolic infrastructure of a host. We developed a novel web server, called MRE, which, for a given pair of starting and desired compounds in a given chassis organism, ranks biosynthesis routes from the perspective of the integration of new reactions into the endogenous metabolic system. For each promising heterologous biosynthesis pathway, MRE suggests actual enzymes for foreign metabolic reactions and generates information on competing endogenous reactions for the consumption of metabolites. These unique, chassis-centered features distinguish MRE from existing pathway design tools and allow synthetic biologists to evaluate the design of their biosynthesis systems from a different angle.

Despite the advances in recent decades on sequence alignment, threading and alignment-free methods, protein homology detection remains a challenging open problem. Recently, network methods that try to find transitive paths in the protein structure space demonstrate the importance of incorporating network information of the structure space. Yet, current methods merge the sequence space and the structure space into a single space, and thus introduce inconsistency in combining different sources of information.

            " Motivation: Life science researchers often require an exhaustive list of protein coding genes similar to a given query gene. To find such genes, homology search tools, such as BLAST or PatternHunter, return a set of high-scoring pairs (HSPs). These HSPs then need to be correlated with existing sequence annotations, or assembled manually into putative gene structures. This process is error-prone and labor-intensive, especially in genomes without reliable gene annotation. Results: We have developed a homology search solution that automates this process, and instead of HSPs returns complete gene structures. We achieve better sensitivity and specificity by adapting a hidden Markov model for gene finding to reflect features of the query gene. Compared to traditional homology search, our novel approach identifies splice sites much more reliably and can even locate exons that were lost in \u2026",

In particular, comprehensive molecular simulation studies revealed that although sharing similar overall structures, the two Agos have vastly different conformational landscapes and guide-strand loading mechanisms because of the distinct rigidity of their L1-PAZ hinge.

A variety of structure alignment algorithms and programs has been designed and implemented for this purpose. A major drawback with existing structure alignment programs is that they require a large amount of computational time, rendering them infeasible for pairwise alignments on large collections of structures. To overcome this drawback, a fragment alphabet learned from known structures has been introduced. The method, however, considers local similarity only, and therefore occasionally assigns high scores to structures that are similar only in local fragments. Method: We propose a novel approach that eliminates false positives, through the comparison of both local and remote similarity, with little compromise in speed.

Thus, fully automatic methods to cluster proteins in the protein structure space have been designed and developed.
