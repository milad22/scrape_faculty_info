            "Recent work on the subject of isolated quantum thermalization has suggested that an individual energy eigenstate of a non-integrable quantum system may encode a significant amount of information about that system's Hamiltonian. We provide a theoretical argument, along with supporting numerics, that this information includes the critical behaviour of a system with a second-order, finite-temperature phase transition.",
