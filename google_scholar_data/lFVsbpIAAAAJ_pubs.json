            "AlGaN\/GaN high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were fabricated on SiC substrates with epitaxial layers grown by multiple suppliers and methods. Devices with gate lengths varying from 0.50 to 0.09 mum were fabricated on each sample. We demonstrate the impact of varying the gate lengths and show that the unity current gain frequency response (f T ) is limited by short-channel effects for all samples measured. We present an empirically based physical model that can predict the expected extrinsic f T  for many combinations of gate length and commonly used barrier layer thickness (t bar ) on silicon nitride passivated T-gated AlGaN\/GaN HEMTs. The result is that even typical high-aspect-ratio (gate length to barrier thickness) devices show device performance limitations due to short-channel effects. We present the design tradeoffs and show the parameter space required to achieve optimal frequency \u2026",

Utilizing the change in phonon linewidth by employing a proper reference condition gives true temperature results. Making use of frequency shifts in both the  E 2 (high) and  A 1 (LO) phonon modes offers accurate and time-efficient means to determine the state of temperature and thermal stress in operating AlGaN\/GaN HEMTs presuming that linear relations between phonon frequencies and temperature\/stress are well determined.

Stress was measured by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and micro-photoluminescence (PL). Raman measurements probed the volume average of the stress through the GaN layer whereas the stress near the GaN surface (AlGaN\/GaN heterointerface) was acquired via PL. By combining Raman, PL, and x-ray diffraction, a self-consistent method was developed to accurately determine the variation in magnitude of stress throughout the thickness of the GaN layer. Based on this framework, it is observed in AlGaN\/GaN HEMTs that a depth variation in the GaN residual stress occurs near the gate and ohmic electrodes.

The trap is detected by constant drain current deep level transient spectroscopy (CID-DLTS) and the CID-DLTS thermal emission time constant precisely matches the measured drain lag. Both drain lag and CID-DLTS measurements show this state to already exist in pre-stressed devices, which coupled with its strong increase in concentration as a function of stress in the absence of significant increases in concentrations of other detected traps, imply its role in causing degradation, in particular knee walkout.
