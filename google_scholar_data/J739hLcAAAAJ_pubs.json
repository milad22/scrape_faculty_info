            "We demonstrate that photogenerated excitons in semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be efficiently dissociated by forming a planar heterojunction between CNTs wrapped in semiconducting polymers and the electon acceptor, C60. Illumination of the CNTs at their near-infrared optical band gap results in the generation of a short-circuit photocurrent with peak external and internal quantum efficiencies of 2.3% and 44%, respectively. Using soft CNT-hybrid materials systems combining semiconducting small molecules and polymers, we have fabricated broad-band photodetectors with a specific detectivity >1010 cm Hz1\/2 W1\u2212 from \u03bb = 400 to 1450 nm and a response time of \u03c4 = 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 ns.",

As an example, we anneal diphenyl-functionalized squaraine (DPSQ)\/C60 heterojunctions before or after the deposition of C60. Solvent vapor annealing of DPSQ before C60 deposition results in molecular order at the heterointerface. Organic photovoltaics based on this process have reduced open circuit voltages and power conversion efficiencies relative to as-cast devices. In contrast, annealing following C60 deposition locks in interface disorder found in unannealed junctions while improving order in the thin-film bulk. This results in an increase in short circuit current by >30% while maintaining the open circuit voltage of the as-cast heterojunction device \u2026",

Optimized cells consist of a DBP:C70 mixed layer at a volume ratio of 1:8 and a 9-nm thick C70 cap layer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the visible of the PM-HJ cell is up to 10% larger than the mixed-HJ cell that lacks a C70 acceptor cap layer. The improvement in EQE is attributed to reduced exciton quenching at the MoO3 anode buffer layer surface. This leads to an internal quantum efficiency >90% between the wavelengths of \u03bb\u2009=\u2009450\u2009nm and 550\u2009nm, suggesting efficient exciton dissociation and carrier extraction in the PM-HJ cell.
