            "Photonic technology, using light instead of electrons as the information carrier, is increasingly replacing electronics in communication and information management systems. Microscopic light manipulation, for this purpose, is achievable through photonic bandgap materials 1, 2, a special class of photonic crystals in which three-dimensional, periodic dielectric constant variations controllably prohibit electromagnetic propagation throughout a specified frequency band. This can result in the localization of photons 3, 4, 5, 6, thus providing a mechanism for controlling and inhibiting spontaneous light emission that can be exploited for photonic device fabrication. In fact, carefully engineered line defects could act as waveguides connecting photonic devices in all-optical microchips 7, and infiltration of the photonic material with suitable liquid crystals might produce photonic bandgap structures (and hence light-flow patterns \u2026",

However, until recently, it was not clear which of the various possible phases (cubic, hexagonal, mixed, or random) was the stable one. We have performed a microscopy characterization of solid crystals made of monodisperse SiO2 nanometric spheres. It was found that, for a wide range of particle diameters, the cubic phase is the only one present. This largely serves to confirm recent theoretical calculations by L. V. Woodcock which conclude that the cubic phase is the most stable one. This opens new prospects in the application of colloidal crystals to photonic band gap engineering. ",
