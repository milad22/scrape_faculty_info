            "The physics of non-equilibrium many-body systems is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of theoretical physics. Traditionally used in the study of laser physics and superconducting kinetics, these techniques have more recently found applications in the study of dynamics of cold atomic gases, mesoscopic and nano-mechanical systems. The book gives a self-contained presentation of the modern functional approach to non-equilibrium field-theoretical methods. They are applied to examples ranging from biophysics to the kinetics of superfluids and superconductors. Its step-by-step treatment gives particular emphasis to the pedagogical aspects, making it ideal as a reference for advanced graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics.",

This formalism is an alternative to the previously used replica technique. In addition, it naturally allows for the treatment of nonequilibrium effects. Employing the gauge invariance of the theory and carefully choosing the saddle point in the Q-matrix manifold, we separate purely phase effects of the fluctuating potential from the ones that change quasiparticle dynamics. As a result, the cancellation of super-divergent diagrams (double logarithms in d= 2) is automatically built into the formalism. As a by-product we derive a nonperturbative expression for the single-particle density of states. The remaining low-energy \u03c3 model describes the quantum fluctuations of the electron distribution function. Its saddle-point equation appears to be the quantum kinetic equation with the appropriate collision integral \u2026",

In addition we calculate weak-localization corrections to the drag coefficient and the Hall drag coefficient in a perpendicular magnetic field. As an example of the intralayer interaction effects we consider a situation where one (or both) layers are close to (but above) the superconducting transition temperature. Fluctuation corrections, analogous to the Aslamazov-Larkin corrections, to the drag coefficient are calculated.

            "We evaluate the finite temperature partition sum and correlation functions of the Sachdev\u2013Ye\u2013Kitaev (SYK) model. Starting from a recently proposed mapping of the SYK model onto Liouville quantum mechanics, we obtain our results by exact integration over conformal Goldstone modes reparameterizing physical time. Perhaps, the least expected result of our analysis is that at time scales proportional to the number of particles the out of time order correlation function crosses over from a regime of exponential decay to a universal t\u2212 6 power-law behavior.",
