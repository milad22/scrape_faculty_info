The method involves a fast, reliable, and effective algorithm that exploits the spatial distribution characteristics of human skin color. A universal skin-color map is derived and used on the chrominance component of the input image to detect pixels with skin-color appearance. Then, based on the spatial distribution of the detected skin-color pixels and their corresponding luminance values, the algorithm employs a set of novel regularization processes to reinforce regions of skin-color pixels that are more likely to belong to the facial regions and eliminate those that are not.

            "This work presents a study of three important issues of the color pixel classification approach to skin segmentation: color representation, color quantization, and classification algorithm. Our analysis of several representative color spaces using the Bayesian classifier with the histogram technique shows that skin segmentation based on color pixel classification is largely unaffected by the choice of the color space. However, segmentation performance degrades when only chrominance channels are used in classification. Furthermore, we find that color quantization can be as low as 64 bins per channel, although higher histogram sizes give better segmentation performance. The Bayesian classifier with the histogram technique and the multilayer perceptron classifier are found to perform better compared to other tested classifiers, including three piecewise linear classifiers, three unimodal Gaussian classifiers, and a \u2026",

Skin colors are modeled by a set of three Gaussian clusters, each of which is characterized by a centroid and a covariance matrix. The centroids and covariance matrices are estimated from large set of training samples after a k-means clustering process. Pixels in a color input image can be classified into skin or non-skin based on the Mahalanobis distances to the three clusters. Efficient post-processing techniques namely noise removal, shape criteria, elliptic curve fitting and face\/non-face classification are proposed in order to further refine skin segmentation results for the purpose of face detection.",
