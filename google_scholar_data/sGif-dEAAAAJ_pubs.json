            "Determining whether Earth-like planets are common or rare looms as a touchstone in the question of life in the universe. We searched for Earth-size planets that cross in front of their host stars by examining the brightness measurements of 42,000 stars from National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Kepler mission. We found 603 planets, including 10 that are Earth size () and receive comparable levels of stellar energy to that of Earth (). We account for Kepler\u2019s imperfect detectability of such planets by injecting synthetic planet\u2013caused dimmings into the Kepler brightness measurements and recording the fraction detected. We find that 11 \u00b1 4% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet receiving between one and four times the stellar intensity as Earth. We also find that the occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with increasing orbital period (P), within equal intervals of logP up to \u223c200 d. Extrapolating \u2026",

            "We present 197 planet candidates discovered using data from the first year of the NASA K2 mission (Campaigns 0\u20134), along with the results of an intensive program of photometric analyses, stellar spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation. We distill these candidates into sets of 104 validated planets (57 in multi-planet systems),  false positives, and 63 remaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with median values of R P= , P=  days, =  K, and Kp=  mag. Stellar spectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of these systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets known to orbit moderately bright stars (1\u20134 R\u2295, Kp= 9\u201313 mag). Of particular interest are  planets smaller than 2 R\u2295,  orbiting stars brighter than Kp= 11.5 mag, 5 receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet systems \u2026",
