Radar images with a resolution of 75\u202fm per pixel reveal a roughly spheroidal shape more than 6\u202fkm in diameter at the equator with several discernible surface features hundreds of meters in extent. These include a possible crater more than 1\u202fkm across located below 30\u2218 latitude and a roughly 600-m radar-dark region near one of the poles. Overall, the radar images of Phaethon are reminiscent of those of (101955) Bennu, target of the OSIRIS-REx mission. As such, the shape of Phaethon is suspected to have an equatorial ridge similar to the top-shaped models of several other radar-observed near-Earth asteroids as well as the optical images of (162173) Ryugu returned by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft.

            "In this work, the problem of optimization of interplanetary trajectories with minimum fuel consumption, but with a time limit is studied. It was used a methodology known as the Patched Conics, where the trajectory is divided into three parts: (1) departure phase, inside of the sphere of influence of the departure planet; (2) heliocentric phase, during the journey between the planets; and (3) arrival phase, inside of the sphere of influence of the arrival planet. Furthermore, the possibility of gravitational assisted maneuvers (swing-by) was considered to reduce fuel consumption. In this case the full trajectory would be divided into more parts, depending on the number of maneuvers. Therefore, the goal of this work is to find a combination of conical trajectories, using gravitational assisted maneuvers, which perform the transfer close to the departure planet to the vicinity of the arrival planet, spending minimal fuel with minimal \u2026",

            "The orbital dynamics around irregular shaped bodies is an actual topic in astrodynamics, because celestial bodies are not perfect spheres.  When it comes to small celestial bodies, like asteroids and comets, it is even more import to consider the nonspherical shape. The gravitational field around them may generate trajectories that are different from Keplerian orbits. Modeling an irregular body can be a hard task, especially because it is difficult to know the exact shape when observing it from the Earth, due to their small sizes and long distances. Some asteroids have been observed, but it is still a small amount compared to all existing asteroids in the Solar System. An approximation of their shape can be made as a sum of several known geometric shapes. Some three-dimensional figures have closed equations for the potential and, in this work, the formulation of a cube is considered. The results give the mappings showing the orbits that are less perturbed and then have a good potential to be used by spacecrafts that need to minimize station-keeping maneuvers. Points in the orbit that minimizes the perturbations are found and they can be used for constellations of nanosatellites.",

            "(2,250 Maximum Characters): In the solar system there are many small bodies called asteroids. The large majority of these bodies are located in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. The Near-Earth Objects, or NEOs, are objects with perihelion below 1.3 AU, which include comets and asteroids. The NEOs are considered to have orbits passing close to the Earth\u2019s orbit and, in the case of asteroids, are called Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Among the NEAs there are bodies considered potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), whose minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth is 0.05 AU and that have absolute magnitude (H) of 22, which would mean an asteroid of at least 110-240 meters, depending on its albedo. One of the major characteristic of the asteroids is the irregular shape, causing the dynamics of orbits around these bodies to be different from a spherical shaped \u2026",

            "This work is a study of the dynamics around bodies with non-spherical shapes. The gravitational field of a body with non-uniform mass distribution is not central, resulting on orbits around this body that behave different from a keplerian orbit, generating a perturbation on the gravitational field. Irregular objects can be modelled by combining several geometric figures like parallelepipeds. This model can be applied to asteroids, which are objects with non-spherical shapes. The disturbing force generated by these bodies can then be obtained as the sum of the force on each cube. The present paper makes a first study in this problem by showing the evolution of the keplerian elements of orbits around a cube. It also considers a closed loop control system for the trajectory, required to compensate the perturbations due to the irregular shape of the body with the use of a low thrust engine. The main goal is to show that it is \u2026",
