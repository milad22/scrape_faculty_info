The metals considered for the present analysis are silver, gold, copper, and aluminum. The performance of the sensor with different bimetallic combinations is evaluated and compared numerically. The performance is analyzed in terms of three parameters: sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and operating range. On the basis of the comparison and some logical criteria, the best possible bimetallic combination along with requisite thickness distribution is predicted. The bimetallic combination is capable of simultaneously providing the larger values of sensitivity, SNR, and operating range, which is not possible with any single metallic layer.",

The sensitivity is evaluated for the p-polarized light launched in the fiber using ray approximation. Four-layers configuration is used to excite the surface plasmon wave. The first layer or the medium considered is the core of the fiber. Second and third layers are metallic (silver and gold). The fourth layer or medium is absorbing medium. The effect of the ratio of the thickness of the metallic layers (silver:gold) on the sensitivity of the sensor has been investigated. The sensitivity increases as the silver to gold thickness ratio increases. The gold should be used only to protect silver layer.

The performance evaluation was carried out in terms of three performance parameters: sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio and resolution.

We theoretically analyze the performance of proposed sensor under different conditions related to its constituents, i.e., optical fiber, metallic layer, sensing region, and launched light. The effect of the related parameters such as numerical aperture, fiber length, core diameter, FWHM of the Gaussian input on sensor is analyzed along with its physical explanation. The numerical results presented in this paper leads to a significant optimization of the important design parameters to achieve a high temperature detection accuracy and sensitivity of a fiber optic remote sensor.",
