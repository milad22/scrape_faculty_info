            "The past few decades of research and development in solid-state semicon ductor physics and electronics have witnessed a rapid growth in the drive to exploit quantum mechanics in the design and function of semiconductor devices. This has been fueled for instance by the remarkable advances in our ability to fabricate nanostructures such as quantum wells, quantum wires and quantum dots. Despite this contemporary focus on semiconductor\" quantum devices,\" a principal quantum mechanical aspect of the electron-its spin has it accounts for an added quan largely been ignored (except in as much as tum mechanical degeneracy). In recent years, however, a new paradigm of electronics based on the spin degree of freedom of the electron has begun to emerge. This field of semiconductor\" spintronics\"(spin transport electron ics or spin-based electronics) places electron spin rather than charge at the very center of interest. The underlying basis for this new electronics is the intimate connection between the charge and spin degrees of freedom of the electron via the Pauli principle. A crucial implication of this relationship is that spin effects can often be accessed through the orbital properties of the electron in the solid state. Examples for this are optical measurements of the spin state based on the Faraday effect and spin-dependent transport measure ments such as giant magneto-resistance (GMR). In this manner, information can be encoded in not only the electron's charge but also in its spin state, ie",

            "Magnetic devices are a leading contender for the implementation of memory and logic technologies that are non-volatile, that can scale to high density and high speed, and that do not wear out. However, widespread application of magnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient mechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current and power 1. There has been considerable recent progress in this effort; in particular, it has been discovered that spin\u2013orbit interactions in heavy-metal\/ferromagnet bilayers can produce strong current-driven torques on the magnetic layer 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, via the spin Hall effect 12, 13 in the heavy metal or the Rashba\u2013Edelstein effect 14, 15 in the ferromagnet. In the search for materials to provide even more efficient spin\u2013orbit-induced torques, some proposals 16, 17, 18, 19 have suggested topological insulators 20, 21 \u2026",

Among the most carefully studied of these materials is (Ga, Mn) As, in which meticulous optimization of growth techniques has led to reproducible materials properties and ferromagnetic transition temperatures well above 150 K. We review progress in the understanding of this particular material and efforts to address ferromagnetic semiconductors as a class. We then discuss proposals for how these materials might find applications in spintronics. Finally, we propose criteria that can be used to judge the potential utility of newly discovered ferromagnetic semiconductors, and we suggest guidelines that may be helpful in shaping the search for the ideal material.",

            "Frustration, defined as a competition between interactions such that not all of them can be satisfied, is important in systems ranging from neural networks to structural glasses. Geometrical frustration, which arises from the topology of a well-ordered structure rather than from disorder, has recently become a topic of considerable interest 1. In particular, geometrical frustration among spins in magnetic materials can lead to exotic low-temperature states 2, including \u2018spin ice\u2019, in which the local moments mimic the frustration of hydrogen ion positions in frozen water 3, 4, 5, 6. Here we report an artificial geometrically frustrated magnet based on an array of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands. The islands are arranged such that the dipole interactions create a two-dimensional analogue to spin ice. Images of the magnetic moments of individual elements in this correlated system allow us to study \u2026",

The introduction of n-type dopants increases the electronic spin lifetimes several orders of magnitude relative to insulating counterparts, a trend that is also observed in doped bulk semiconductors. Because the electronic spin polarization in these systems survives for nanoseconds, far longer than the electron-hole recombination lifetime, this technique reveals thousands of spin precession cycles of 15 gigahertz per tesla within an electron gas. Remarkably, these spin beats are only weakly temperature dependent and persist to room temperature.",

            "This article reviews static and dynamic interfacial effects in magnetism, focusing on interfacially driven magnetic effects and phenomena associated with spin-orbit coupling and intrinsic symmetry breaking at interfaces. It provides a historical background and literature survey, but focuses on recent progress, identifying the most exciting new scientific results and pointing to promising future research directions. It starts with an introduction and overview of how basic magnetic properties are affected by interfaces, then turns to a discussion of charge and spin transport through and near interfaces and how these can be used to control the properties of the magnetic layer. Important concepts include spin accumulation, spin currents, spin-transfer torque, and spin pumping. An overview is provided to the current state of knowledge and existing review literature on interfacial effects such as exchange bias, exchange-spring \u2026",

            "Ultrafast optical pulses are used to initiate and measure free-induction decays of coherent conduction electron spins and of embedded magnetic Mn 2+ ions in a series of magnetic-semiconductor quantum wells. These time-resolved Faraday rotation experiments in transverse applied magnetic fields complement previous studies of spin dynamics in longitudinal fields by unambiguously distinguishing between the spin relaxation of electrons and holes, and by identifying a mechanism by which angular momentum is transferred from spin-polarized carriers to the sublattice of local moments. In transverse fields (Voigt geometry), the precession of the photoexcited spins about the field axis can be measured as an oscillatory induced Faraday rotation signal. We observe the THz free-induction decay of spin-polarized electrons in modest (< 4 T) magnetic fields and separately identify the more rapid spin relaxation of the \u2026",
