We find that the Raman response of the gapless QSL of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model exhibits signatures of spin fractionalization into Majorana fermions, which give rise to a broad signal reflecting their density of states, and Z 2 gauge fluxes, which also contribute a sharp feature. We discuss the current experimental situation and explore more generally the effect of breaking the integrability on response functions of Kitaev spin liquids.",

We show that the minimal model describing the magnetism in A 2 IrO 3 includes both isotropic and anisotropic Kitaev-type spin-exchange interactions between nearest and next-nearest neighbor Ir ions, and that the magnitude of the Kitaev interaction between next-nearest neighbor Ir magnetic moments is comparable with nearest neighbor interactions. We also find that, while the Heisenberg and the Kitaev interactions between nearest neighbors are correspondingly antiferro-and ferromagnetic, they both change sign for the next-nearest neighbors.

Two types of magnetic materials, namely ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are considered and the effect of the magnetic subsystem on the properties of the host metal are discussed. Various types of elementary excitations, such as magnetic polaritons, magnetostatic waves, and magnons, are examined within the conventional quasiparticle framework. The dispersion of the quasiparticles as a function of the relation between the characteristic frequencies of electrical and magnetic nature is described over a wide range of frequencies. Particular attention is given to the statistical thermodynamics and kinetics of the magnetic materials.

The model undergoes two phase transitions as a function of temperature. At low temperature, thermal fluctuations induce magnetic long-range order by the order-by-disorder mechanism. This magnetically ordered state with a spontaneously broken Z 6 symmetry persists up to a certain critical temperature. We find that there is an intermediate phase between the low-temperature, ordered phase and the high-temperature, disordered phase. Finite-sized scaling analysis suggests that the intermediate phase is a critical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase with continuously variable exponents.

An axial trigonal distortion of the cubic states is also taken into account.

For large values of J K, we obtain a ferromagnetically ordered solution and a Kondo regime with a Kondo temperature, T K, larger than the Curie temperature, T C. This finding suggests a scenario for a coexistence of Kondo effect and ferromagnetic order. In some uranium compounds, such as UTe or U Cu 0.9 Sb 2, this kind of coexistence has been experimentally observed: they order ferromagnetically with a Curie temperature of order T C\u223c 100 K and exhibit a Kondo behavior for T> T C.
