Calculations have been made for these transitions using a double expansion in Z\u2212 1 and \u03b1 2 Z 2. These calculations include the nonrelativistic energy, one-electron Dirac energy, plus relativistic corrections and the Breit interaction calculated in first-order perturbation theory in both high-Z and low-Z approximations. After considering the one-electron Lamb-shift corrections to high order, comparison with our measurements and with other experiments for Z= 4\u2212 26 reveals a discrepancy which is approximately 0.015 Z 3 cm\u2212 1. We show that this can arise from two-electron quantum electrodynamic corrections to the one-electron Lamb shift and we derive an ab initio estimate of this correction in good agreement with the observations.",

The apparatus is driven by a simple oscillating mechanism powered by a 200 pulse per revolution stepper motor running at constant angular velocity. A computer interface generates the uniform pulse train needed to run the stepper motor and, with each pulse, reads a rotary encoder attached to the pendulum axle. Ten million readings from overnight runs of 50\u200a000 drive cycles were smoothed and differentiated to obtain the pendulum angle \u03b8 and the angular velocity \u03c9 at each pulse of the drive. A plot of the 50\u200a000 (\u03b8,\u03c9) phase points corresponding to one phase of the drive system produces a single Poincar\u00e9 section. Thus, 200 Poincar\u00e9 sections are experimentally available, one at each step of the drive. Viewed separately, any one of them \u2026",

Intensity measurements of the radiation emitted at 90 to the beam direction as a function of distance downstream from the target in electric fields both parallel and antiparallel to the beam axis allow extraction of the coherence between the s and p states by Eck\u2019s method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 31, 270 (1973)]. Because the jet target allows the collisions to occur in the applied field, we have eliminated the problems associated with field inhomogeneities when gas target cells are used. A strong-intensity peak emitted by excited helium in the target allows a determination of the starting point of the evolution in the field as well as a determination of the effects of experimental averaging. We present the s-p coherence parameters as a function of the projectile energy and \u2026",
