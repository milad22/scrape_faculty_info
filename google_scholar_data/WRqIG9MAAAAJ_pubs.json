An original analysis, based on in-depth physico-chemical characterization, device electrical measurements, empirical model and first principle calculations, is shown. We argue that optimized ~10% Sb doping in the GeS 2  electrolyte allows to achieve SET speed of 30ns at 2.2V (i.e. 0.66pJ SET programming power), while assuring 10 years data retention at 125\u00b0C, >10 5  cycling and high robustness to Sn-Pb soldering profile. Finally, the improved thermal stability of the filament in the GeS 2 -Sb matrix is clearly elucidated by means of molecular dynamics calculations.",

Doping the resistive layer of oxide\/Cu based CBRAM with <; dopant species and concentrations is proposed in order to improve the memory performances. By means of experimental characterizations, numerical model and atomistic calculations, we demonstrate that increasing the doping content ease the filament formation by facilitating the Cu injection in the resistive layer. The proper choice of the doping element and concentration allows to significantly reduce the forming voltage (up to a forming free behavior), or alternatively to increase the memory window of 3 decades, with no forming voltage increase and retention degradation (stable behavior at 200\u00b0C, 260\u00b0C soldering sustained).",

From the model and experimental results obtained on decananometric devices, we propose an understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the CBRAM operations.

Results are explained in terms of a thermally and field driven ion hopping model for reversible resistance switching. The combined analysis reveals that at high temperature the set voltage and the set resistance decrease. Furthermore, the study suggests that applying the same reset condition, for GeS 2 thicknesses lower than 50 nm, the conductive filament is almost dissolved, while for thicker layers a portion of the filament still remains.",
