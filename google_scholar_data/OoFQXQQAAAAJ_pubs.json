            "Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people in the United States. It is a complex disease whose etiology bridges biomechanics and biochemistry. Evidence is growing for the role of systemic factors (such as genetics, dietary intake, estrogen use, and bone density) and of local biomechanical factors (such as muscle weakness, obesity, and joint laxity). These risk factors are particularly important in weight-bearing joints, and modifying them may present opportunities for prevention of osteoarthritis-related pain and disability. Major advances in management to reduce pain and disability are yielding a panoply of available treatments ranging from nutriceuticals to chondrocyte transplantation, new oral anti-inflammatory medications, and health education.

            "Due to its avascular nature, articular cartilage exhibits a very limited capacity to regenerate and to repair. Although much of the tissue-engineered cartilage in existence has been successful in mimicking the morphological and biochemical appearance of hyaline cartilage, it is generally mechanically inferior to the natural tissue. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the application of dynamic deformational loading at physiological strain levels enhances chondrocyte matrix elaboration in cell-seeded agarose scaffolds to produce a more functional engineered tissue construct than in free swelling controls. A custom-designed bioreactor was used to load cell-seeded agarose disks dynamically in unconfined compression with a peak-to-peak compressive strain amplitude of 10 percent, at a frequency of 1 Hz,  (1 hour on, 1 hour off)\/day, 5 days\/week for 4 weeks. Results demonstrated that dynamically loaded disks yielded a sixfold \u2026",

This lack of a tailored software environment has hampered research progress, as well as dissemination of models and results. To address these issues, we developed the FEBio software suite (http:\/\/mrl. sci. utah. edu\/software\/febio), a nonlinear implicit finite element (FE) framework, designed specifically for analysis in computational solid biomechanics. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical basis of FEBio and its main features. FEBio offers modeling scenarios, constitutive models, and boundary conditions, which are relevant to numerous applications in biomechanics.

The imaging voxel size was 0.47\u00d70.47\u00d71.0 mm. Both a manual and a semi-automated segmentation method were employed to extract topographic measurements from MRI. Following MRI, each of the six cadaveric knees was dissected and its articular surfaces quantified using stereophotogrammetry.
