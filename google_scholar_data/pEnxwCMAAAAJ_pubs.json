            "In a closed economic system, money is conserved. Thus, by analogy with energy, the equilibrium probability distribution of money must follow the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs law characterized by an effective temperature equal to the average amount of money per economic agent. We demonstrate how the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution emerges in computer simulations of economic models. Then we consider a thermal machine, in which the difference of temperatures allows one to extract a monetary profit. We also discuss the role of debt, and models with broken time-reversal symmetry for which the Boltzmann-Gibbs law does not hold. The instantaneous distribution of money among the agents of a system should not be confused with the distribution of wealth. The latter also includes material wealth, which is not conserved, and thus may have a different (e.g. power-law) distribution.",

By analogy with the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in physics, it is shown that the probability distribution of money is exponential for certain classes of models with interacting economic agents. Alternative scenarios are also reviewed. Data analysis of the empirical distributions of wealth and income reveals a two-class distribution. The majority of the population belongs to the lower class, characterized by the exponential (\u201cthermal\u201d) distribution, whereas a small fraction of the population in the upper class is characterized by the power-law (\u201csuperthermal\u201d) distribution. The lower part is very stable, stationary in time, whereas the upper part is highly dynamical and out of equilibrium.",

The formula is in excellent agreement with the Dow\u2010Jones index for time lags from 1 to 250 trading days. For large returns, the distribution is exponential in log\u2010returns with a time\u2010dependent exponent, whereas for small returns it is Gaussian. For time lags longer than the relaxation time of variance, the probability distribution can be expressed in a scaling form using a Bessel function.

In the tunneling limit, the Josephson current is proportional to the first power (not square) of the electron tunneling amplitude. Thus, the Josephson current between unconventional superconductors is carried by single electrons, rather than by Cooper pairs.

The topological term in action leads to specific quantised Hall effect for spin current in 3 He-A. In the planar phase of the 3 He film the non-singular 4 pi spin disclination has the fractional fermion charge 1\/2 n which corresponds to the fractional electric charge 1\/2 en for the disclination in the planar state superconductor. The spin disclination in the 3 He-A 1 film has both the fractional spin 1\/4 h (cross) n and fractional charge 1\/4 n.",

            "We study instabilities occurring in the electron system whose Fermi surface has flat regions on its opposite sides. Such a Fermi surface resembles Fermi surfaces of some high-T c superconductors. In the framework of the parquet approximation, we classify possible instabilities and derive renormalization-group equations that determine the evolution of corresponding susceptibilities with decreasing temperature. Numerical solutions of the parquet equations are found to be in qualitative agreement with a ladder approximation. For the repulsive Hubbard interaction, the antiferromagnetic (spin-density-wave) instability dominates, but when the Fermi surface is not perfectly flat, the d-wave superconducting instability takes over.",
