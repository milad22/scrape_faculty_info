            "Evaporation and condensation at a liquid\/vapor interface are ubiquitous interphase mass and energy transfer phenomena that are still not well understood. We have carried out large scale molecular dynamics simulations of Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids composed of monomers, dimers, or trimers to investigate these processes with molecular detail. For LJ monomers in contact with a vacuum, the evaporation rate is found to be very high with significant evaporative cooling and an accompanying density gradient in the liquid domain near the liquid\/vapor interface. Increasing the chain length to just dimers significantly reduces the evaporation rate. We confirm that mechanical equilibrium plays a key role in determining the evaporation rate and the density and temperature profiles across the liquid\/vapor interface. The velocity distributions of evaporated molecules and the evaporation and condensation coefficients are \u2026",

            "Contact area plays a central role in continuum theories of friction and adhesion, and there is growing interest in calculating it with atomic resolution. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study definitions of contact area based on instantaneous and time-averaged forces or separations between atoms. Flat and spherical surfaces with different atomic geometries, adhesion, and temperatures are examined. In continuum theory, the fraction of two flat surfaces that is in contact rises sharply from zero to unity when a load is applied. This simple behavior is surprisingly difficult to reproduce with atomic scale definitions of contact. At typical temperatures, nonadhesive surfaces are held apart by a small fraction of atoms with large thermal fluctuations until the normal pressure is comparable to the ideal hardness. The contact area associated with atoms interacting at any instant rises linearly with load. Time \u2026",

Previous studies of bare surfaces showed that the atomic scale deviations from a sphere that are present on any tip constructed from discrete atoms lead to significant deviations from continuum theory and dramatic variability in friction forces. Introducing an adsorbed monolayer leads to larger deviations from continuum theory but decreases the variations between tips with different atomic structure. Although the film is fluid, it remains in the contact and behaves qualitatively like a thin elastic coating except for certain tips at high loads.

            "Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer film during solvent evaporation. As the solvent evaporates, a dense polymer-rich skin layer forms at the liquid\/vapor interface, which is either NP rich or poor depending on the strength of the NP\/polymer interaction. When the NPs are strongly wet by the polymer, the NPs accumulate at the interface and form layers. However, when the NPs are only partially wet by the polymer, most NPs are uniformly distributed in the bulk of the polymer film, with the dense skin layer serving as a barrier to prevent the NPs from moving to the interface. Our results point to a possible route to employ less favorable NP\/polymer interactions and fast solvent evaporation to uniformly disperse NPs in a polymer film, contrary to the common belief that strong NP\/polymer attractions are needed to make NPs well dispersed in polymer \u2026",

            "While evaporating solvent is a widely used technique to assemble nano-sized objects into desired superstructures, there has been limited work on how the assembled structures are affected by the physical aspects of the process. We present large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the evaporation-induced assembly of nanoparticles suspended in a liquid that evaporates in a controlled fashion. The quality of the nanoparticle crystal formed just below the liquid\/vapor interface is found to be better at relatively slower evaporation rates, as less defects and grain boundaries appear. This trend is understood as the result of the competition between the accumulation and diffusion times of nanoparticles at the liquid\/vapor interface. When the former is smaller, nanoparticles are deposited so fast at the interface that they do not have sufficient time to arrange through diffusion, which leads to the prevalence of defects and \u2026",
