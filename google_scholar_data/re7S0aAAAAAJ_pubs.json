            "The major uncertainties involved in the Chandrasekhar mass models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are related to the companion star of their accreting white dwarf progenitor (which determines the accretion rate and consequently the carbon ignition density) and the flame speed after the carbon ignition. We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in relatively slow deflagrations with a variety of deflagration speeds and ignition densities to put new constraints on the above key quantities. The abundance of the Fe group, in particular of neutron\u2010rich species like 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, 54,58Fe, and 58Ni, is highly sensitive to the electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields obtained from such a slow central deflagration, and from a fast deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. To avoid excessively large ratios of 54Cr\/56Fe and \u2026",

In this process, antineutrino absorptions in the proton-rich environment produce neutrons that are immediately captured by neutron-deficient nuclei. This allows for the nucleosynthesis of nuclei with mass numbers A> 64, making this process a possible candidate to explain the origin of the solar abundances of Mo 92, 94 and Ru 96, 98.

            "We have performed ab initio neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations in three and two spatial dimensions (3D and 2D) of core-collapse supernovae from the same 15 M\u2609 progenitor through 440 ms after core bounce. Both 3D and 2D models achieve explosions; however, the onset of explosion (shock revival) is delayed by~ 100 ms in 3D relative to the 2D counterpart and the growth of the diagnostic explosion energy is slower. This is consistent with previously reported 3D simulations utilizing iron-core progenitors with dense mantles. In the~ 100 ms before the onset of explosion, diagnostics of neutrino heating and turbulent kinetic energy favor earlier explosion in 2D. During the delay, the angular scale of convective plumes reaching the shock surface grows and explosion in 3D is ultimately lead by a single, large-angle plume, giving the expanding shock a directional orientation not dissimilar from those \u2026",
