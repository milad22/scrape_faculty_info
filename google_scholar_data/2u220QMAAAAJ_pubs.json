            "A fully interacting effective chiral Lagrangian obeying the anomalous axial-baryon-current conservation law is constructed. This Lagrangian is a generalization of one implied by the 1 N approximation. In a certain sense, the old \u03c3 model is recovered. Our Lagrangian displays the dependence of amplitudes on the quantum-chromodynamic vacuum angle \u03b8, gives soft \u03b7\u2032 theorems, and hints at a possible complementarity between the instanton and 1 N approaches. We can rewrite our model in terms of a gauge-invariant gluon field.",

Such asymptotic planarity is compared to the field-theoretical concept of asymptotic freedom. The characteristics low-t cylinder \u201cquenching interval\u201d is found to be the inverse of the mean value over a two-reggeon loop, of 1 2 \u03c0 2 (\u03b1\u2032) 2 (t 1\u2212 t 2) 2\/(\u2212 t), where t 1 and t 2 are the squared masses of the loop reggeons and \u03b1\u2032 is the trajectory slope. For leading trajectories the low-t cylinder quenching interval is predicted by this formula to be roughly 0.5 GeV 2-consistent with the observed pomeron intercept and slope, with the p-\u03c9 and fA 2 mass differences and with the (\u03c6, \u03c9) deviation from ideal mixing.
