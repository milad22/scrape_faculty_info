            "Protein-protein interactions are often mediated by flexible loops that experience conformational dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. NMR relaxation studies can map these dynamics. However, defining the network of inter-converting conformers that underlie the relaxation data remains generally challenging. Here, we combine NMR relaxation experiments with simulation to visualize networks of inter-converting conformers. We demonstrate our approach with the apo Pin1-WW domain, for which NMR has revealed conformational dynamics of a flexible loop in the millisecond range. We sample and cluster the free energy landscape using Markov State Models (MSM) with major and minor exchange states with high correlation with the NMR relaxation data and low NOE violations. These MSM are hierarchical ensembles of slowly interconverting, metastable macrostates and rapidly interconverting microstates. We found a low population state that consists primarily of holo-like conformations and is a \u201chub\u201d visited by most pathways between macrostates. These results suggest that conformational equilibria between holo-like and alternative conformers pre-exist in the intrinsic dynamics of apo Pin1-WW. Analysis using MutInf, a mutual information method for quantifying correlated motions, reveals that WW dynamics not only play a role in substrate recognition, but also may help couple the substrate binding site on the WW domain to the one on the catalytic domain. Our work represents an important step towards building networks of inter-converting conformational states and is generally applicable.",

Nos\u00e9, Mol. Phys., 52 (1984), p. 255]. To achieve the ergodicity required for canonical sampling, a number of techniques have been proposed based on incorporating additional thermostatting variables, such as Nos\u00e9--Hoover chains and more recent fully Hamiltonian generalizations. For Nos\u00e9 dynamics, it is often stated that the system is driven to equilibrium through a resonant interaction between the self-oscillation frequency of the thermostat variable and a natural frequency of the underlying system. In this article, we clarify this perspective, using harmonic models, and exhibit practical deficiencies of the standard Nos\u00e9 chain approach.

Our basis set uses the eigenvectors of a mass reweighted Hessian matrix calculated with a biomolecular force field. This particular choice has the advantage of an ordering according to the eigenvalues, which have a physical meaning of being the square of the mode frequency. Low frequency eigenvalues correspond to more collective motions, whereas the highest frequency eigenvalues are the limiting factor for the stability of the integrator. In NML, the higher frequency modes are overdamped and relaxed near their energy minimum while respecting the subspace of low frequency dynamical modes.
