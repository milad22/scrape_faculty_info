Recommended values and uncertainties are provided for key cross sections, and a recommended spectrum is given for B 8 solar neutrinos. Opportunities for further increasing the precision of key rates are also discussed, including new facilities, new experimental techniques, and improvements in theory.

Because of the cosmic ray suppression provided by the Gran Sasso underground laboratory, it has been possible to measure \u03c3 (E) throughout the energy range in which this reaction occurs in the Sun, ie, down to 16.5 keV center of mass energy. The data clearly show the cross section increase due to the electron screening effect but they do not exhibit any evidence for a narrow resonance suggested to explain the 8 B and 7 Be solar neutrino flux reduction.",

The cross sesction ratio,R(E)=\u03c3(d,n)\/\u03c3(d, p), approaches unity (within 2%) at low energies; thus there is no experimental evidence for the Oppenheimer-Phillips effect at subcoulomb energies.

For the first time the lowest projectile energies utilized for the cross section measurement correspond to energies below the center of the solar Gamow peak (E 0= 22 keV). The data provide no evidence for the existence of a hypothetical resonance in the energy range investigated. Although no extrapolation is needed anymore (except for energies at the low-energy tail of the Gamow peak), the data must be corrected for the effects of electron screening, clearly observed the first time for the 3 He (3 He, 2 p) 4 He reaction. The effects are, however, larger than expected and not understood, leading presently to the largest uncertainty on the quoted S b (0) value for bare nuclides (= 5.40 MeV b).",

            "A compact high-current 50 kV ion accelerator facility including a windowless gas target system, a beam calorimeter, and detector telescopes in close geometry has been built and tested. The data acquisition and analysis involved a multiparameter system and a Monte Carlo program. The LUNA facility, presently installed at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory, is a pilot project focused initially on cross section measurements of the 3He(3He, 2p)4He reaction within the thermal energy region of the sun. To achieve this goal, the experimental sensitivity has been improved by more than four orders of magnitude over that of previous work.",

The decay of N a 22 leads to the emission of a characteristic 1.275 MeV gamma-ray line. This report provides the first direct measurement of the rate of this reaction using a radioactive N a 21 beam, and discusses its astrophysical implications.
