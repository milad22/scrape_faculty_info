            "A regime of the plasma wave-field accelerator (PWFA) is proposed, in which a high-intensity electron beam is used to excite extremely nonlinear, transverse motion-dominated plasma oscillations. Through computational analysis of the plasma electron motion and the associated wake fields, it is shown that if the beam is dense enough to eject nearly all of the plasma electrons from the beam channel, then the short-range wake fields are of excellent quality for acceleration and focusing of electron beams. These results clear up many conceptual difficulties with the practical realization of a PWFA.",

            "In this paper we provide an analytical description for the transverse dynamics of relativistic, space-charge-dominated beams undergoing strong acceleration, such as those typically produced by rf photoinjectors. These beams are chiefly characterized by a fast transition, due to strong acceleration, from the nonrelativistic to the relativistic regime in which the initially strong collective plasma effects are greatly diminished. However, plasma oscillations in the transverse plane are still effective in significantly perturbing the evolution of the transverse phase space distribution, introducing distortions and longitudinal-transverse correlations that cause an increase in the rms transverse emittance of the beam as a whole. The beam envelope evolution is dominated by such effects and not by the thermal emittance, and so the beam flow can be considered quasilaminar. The model adopted is based on the rms envelope equation \u2026",

            "The use of infrared lasers to power optical-scale lithographically fabricated particle accelerators is a developing area of research that has garnered increasing interest in recent years. The physics and technology of this approach is reviewed, which is referred to as dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). In the DLA scheme operating at typical laser pulse lengths of 0.1 to 1 ps, the laser damage fluences for robust dielectric materials correspond to peak surface electric fields in the GV\/m regime. The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons) for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required pulse energies \u2026",
