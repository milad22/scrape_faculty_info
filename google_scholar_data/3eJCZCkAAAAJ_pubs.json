Developed originally in the field of econometrics, it has since found application in a broader arena, particularly in neuroscience. More recently transfer entropy, an information-theoretic measure of time-directed information transfer between jointly dependent processes, has gained traction in a similarly wide field. While it has been recognized that the two concepts must be related, the exact relationship has until now not been formally described. Here we show that for Gaussian variables, Granger causality and transfer entropy are entirely equivalent, thus bridging autoregressive and information-theoretic approaches to data-driven causal inference.",

This article describes a fundamentally different approach to identifying causal connectivity in neuroscience: a focus on the predictability of ongoing activity in one part from that in another. This approach was made possible by a new method that comes from the pioneering work of Wiener (1956) and Granger (1969). The Wiener\u2013Granger method, unlike stimulation and ablation, does not require direct intervention in the nervous system. Rather, it relies on the estimation of causal statistical influences between simultaneously recorded neural time series data, either in the absence of identifiable behavioral events or in the context of task performance.

The model associates presence with successful \u2018explaining away\u2019 by top-down predictions of informative interoceptive signals evoked by autonomic control signals and, indirectly, by visceral responses to afferent sensory signals. The model connects presence to agency by allowing that predicted interoceptive signals will depend on whether afferent sensory signals are determined, by a parallel predictive-coding mechanism, to be self-generated or externally caused. Anatomically, we identify the anterior insular cortex as the likely locus of key neural comparator mechanisms. Our model integrates a broad range of previously disparate evidence, makes predictions for conjoint manipulations of agency and presence, offers a new view of emotion as interoceptive inference, and represents a step towards a mechanistic account of a fundamental phenomenological property of consciousness.",

Granger causality (G-causality) analysis provides a powerful method for achieving this, by identifying directed functional (\u201ccausal\u201d) interactions from time-series data. G-causality implements a statistical, predictive notion of causality whereby causes precede, and help predict, their effects. It is defined in both the time and frequency domains, and it allows for the conditioning out of common causal influences. In this paper we explain the theoretical basis and computational implementation of G-causality analysis in neuroimaging and, more broadly, in neurophysiology, noting both its exciting potential and the assumptions that govern its application and interpretation.Concepts of brain \u2026",
