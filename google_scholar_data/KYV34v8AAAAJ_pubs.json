Within this framework, we present the Feynman rules for noncommutative QCD and compute explicitly the most dangerous Lorentz-violating operator generated through radiative corrections. We find that interesting effects appear at the one-loop level, in contrast to conventional noncommutative U(N) gauge theories, leading to a stringent bound. Our results are consistent with others appearing recently in the literature that suggest collider limits are not competitive with low-energy tests of Lorentz violation for bounding the scale of spacetime noncommutativity.",

Although Yukawa matrices are hierarchical in the models we consider, the mixing between second-and third-generation neutrinos is naturally large. We first present a quantitative analysis of a minimal model proposed in earlier work, consisting of a global fit to fermion masses and mixing angles, including the most important renormalization group effects. We then propose two new variant models: The first reproduces all important features of the SU (5)\u00d7 U (2) unified theory with neither SU (5) nor U (2).

Fits are performed using subsets of the complete set of nine operators, including corrections up to O(1\/Nc) where leading order is Nc1.

            "We study hadronic two-body decays of the orbitally excited, SU (6) 70-plet baryons in order to test the hypothesis that the successes of the nonrelativistic quark model have a natural explanation in the large-N c limit of QCD. By working in a Hartree approximation, we isolate a specific set of operators that contribute to the observed s-and d-wave decays in leading order in 1\/N c. We fit our results to the current experimental decay data, and make predictions for a number of allowed but unobserved modes. Our tentative conclusion is that there is more to the nonrelativistic quark model of baryons than large N c.",

Higgs portal couplings between the dark and standard model sectors provide an origin for the Higgs mass squared parameter and, hence, the electroweak scale. We find that choices for model parameters exist in which the dark gauge multiplet is viable as dark matter.",
