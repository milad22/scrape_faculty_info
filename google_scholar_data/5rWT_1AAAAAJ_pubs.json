These combined measurements allow to estimate the characteristic transport parameters of both Pt and Ta layers juxtaposed to yttrium iron garnet (YIG): the spin mixing conductance G\u2191\u2193 at the YIG| normal metal interface, the spin Hall angle \u0398 SH, and the spin diffusion length \u03bb sd in the normal metal. The inverse spin Hall voltages generated in Pt and Ta by the pure spin current pumped from YIG excited at resonance confirm the opposite signs of spin Hall angles in these two materials. Moreover, from the dependence of the inverse spin Hall voltage on the Ta thickness, we extract the spin diffusion length in Ta, found to be \u03bb sd Ta= 1.8\u00b10.7 nm. Both the YIG| Pt and YIG| Ta systems display a similar variation of resistance upon magnetic field orientation, which can be explained in the recently \u2026",

We demonstrate Inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) detection of propagating spin waves using Pt. The amplitude and the lineshape of the ISHE voltage correlate well to the increase of the Gilbert damping when decreasing thickness of YIG.

The demonstration rests upon the measurement of the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth as a function of I dc using a magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM). It is shown that the magnetic losses of spin-wave modes existing in the magnetic insulator can be reduced or enhanced by at least a factor of 5 depending on the polarity and intensity of an in-plane dc current I dc flowing through the adjacent normal metal with strong spin-orbit interaction. Complete compensation of the damping of the fundamental mode by spin-orbit torque is reached for a current density of\u223c 3\u00d7 10 11 A\u00b7 m\u2212 2, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

These can be transmitted into adjacent conducting layers through an interface exchange interaction with conduction electrons. It is in principle also possible to inject angular momentum into insulators but the relevant physical mechanisms are not yet identified. In order to test some ideas concerning pure spin transport through insulating oxides, the present paper reports on the behaviour of two materials with very different properties: NiO is an antiferromagnet whereas SiO 2 is a non-magnetic light element insulator. While a sizeable flow of angular momentum is found to be able to propagate through nickel oxide, a SiO 2 layer as thin as 2 nm completely blocks this transfer. This underlines some essential features required to conduct a spin current, including the presence of either magnetic order \u2026",

The experiment is performed on a YIG| Pt bilayer. The choice of yttrium iron garnet (YIG), a magnetic insulator, ensures that no charge current flows between the two layers and only the pure spin current produced by the magnetization dynamics is transferred into the adjacent strong spin-orbit Pt layer via spin pumping. To avoid measuring the parasitic eddy currents induced at the frequency of the microwave source, a resonance at half the frequency is induced using parametric excitation in the parallel geometry. Triggering this nonlinear effect allows us to directly detect on a spectrum analyzer the microwave component of the inverse spin Hall effect voltage.

Using a magnetic resonance force microscope, we measure precisely the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of each individual YIG and YIG|Pt nanodisks. We find that the linewidth in the nanostructure is sensibly smaller than the one measured in the extended film. Analysis of the frequency dependence of the spectral linewidth indicates that the improvement is principally due to the suppression of the inhomogeneous part of the broadening due to geometrical confinement, suggesting that only the homogeneous broadening contributes to the linewidth of the nanostructure.

The mean switching time depends inversely on pulse amplitude for all junctions studied. However, the switching dynamics is found to be strongly dependent on junction size and pulse amplitude. In 50-nm-diameter junctions the switching onset is stochastic but the switching once started, is fast; after being initiated it takes less than 2 ns to switch. In larger diameter junctions the time needed for complete switching is strongly dependent on the pulse amplitude, reaching times less than 2 ns at large pulse amplitudes.
