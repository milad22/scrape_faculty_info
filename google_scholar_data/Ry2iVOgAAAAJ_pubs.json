            "This paper demonstrates the potential application of Mo-doped SrFeO3\u2212\u03b4 perovskites as new cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). SrFe1\u2212xMoxO3\u2212\u03b4 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.25) perovskite materials have been synthesized by a microwave-assisted combustion method. By doping with Mo, the electrical conductivity of the doped SrFeO3\u2212\u03b4 in air is reduced with increasing amounts of Mo. At 800 \u00b0C, the conductivity drops from about 62 to 22 S cm\u22121 when the doping level is increased to 25%. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) results, a decrease in the concentration of charge carrier Fe4+ ions may account for the decrease in electrical conductivity. In contrast, the resistance to sintering and tolerance to reduction of SrFeO3\u2212\u03b4 are improved by Mo-doping. Additionally, the thermal expansion coefficient at 800 \u00b0C \u2026",

            "Cost and reliability of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system resulting from high operating temperature severely hinders its wide-spread commercialization. In this study, high performance low temperature SOFCs with hierarchically porous nano cathode network (Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3\u2013Gd0.1Ce0.9O2\u2212\u03b4, SSC\u2013GDC) have been fabricated by vacuum-free infiltration and subsequent freeze-drying combustion. The straight open GDC cathode skeleton and NiO\u2013GDC anode substrate prepared by freeze-drying tape-casting facilitate mass transport while the nano cathode catalyst promotes the electrochemical reactions. The cell with straight open electrodes and hierarchically porous cathode network demonstrates a maximum power density of 0.65 W cm\u22122 at 500 \u00b0C and impressive stability for more than 500 h at 400 \u00b0C using H2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.

            "Abatement of CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled power plants is currently the sole near-term solution to stabilize CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Separation and capture of CO2 from process streams of these power plants is the first step toward this effort. In this paper, we report a high flux membrane consisting of highly and efficiently interconnected three-dimensional ionic channels prepared from a combined \u201cco-precipitation\u201d and \u201csacrificial-template\u201d synthesis. The membranes exhibit remarkable CO2 permeation characteristic, achieving a CO2 flux density two orders of magnitude higher than other similar systems reported in the literature. The experimental results also have an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Overall, the demonstrated dual-phase membranes show a great promise for selective pre-combustion CO2 separation.",
