            "The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,062 new measurements from 721 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including those on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group \"http:\/\/pdg.lbl.gov\".",

The main goal of the working group was to present the state-of-the-art of Higgs physics at the LHC, integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. The first part compiles the most up-to-date predictions of Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios, parton distribution functions, and off-shell Higgs boson production and interference effects. The second part discusses the recent progress in Higgs effective field theory predictions, followed by the third part on pseudo-observables, simplified template cross section and fiducial cross section measurements, which give the baseline framework for Higgs boson property measurements. The fourth part deals with the beyond the Standard Model predictions of various benchmark scenarios of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, extended scalar sector, Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and exotic Higgs boson decays. This report follows three previous working-group reports: Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002), Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002), and Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 3. Higgs properties (CERN-2013-004). The current report serves as the baseline reference for Higgs physics in LHC Run 2 and beyond.",

After a discussion of the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and some popular ways to probe the new physics implied by recent data, it summarizes what can be learned about neutrino interactions as well as the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model from the various proposed neutrino experiments. The intriguing possibility that neutrino mass physics may be at the heart of our understanding of a long standing puzzle of cosmology, ie the origin of matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry is also discussed.",

We find that the one-loop contributions are comparable to the tree level corrections in some regions of parameter space. The fermion loop contribution dominates in the low cutoff scale f region. On the other hand, the scalar loop contribution dominates in the high cutoff scale f region and it grows with the cutoff scale f. This in turn implies an upper bound on the cutoff scale. A low cutoff scale is allowed for a non-zero triplet vacuum expectation value. Constraints on various other parameters in the model are also discussed. The role of triplet scalars in constructing a consistent renormalization scheme is emphasized.",

            "We propose a model based on SU (5)\u00d7 T (d) which successfully gives rise to near tri-bimaximal leptonic mixing as well as realistic CKM matrix elements for the quarks. The Georgi\u2013Jarlskog relations for three generations are also obtained. Due to the T (d) transformation property of the matter fields, the b-quark mass can be generated only when the T (d) symmetry is broken, giving a dynamical origin for the hierarchy between m b and m t. There are only nine operators allowed in the Yukawa sector up to at least mass dimension seven due to an additional Z 12\u00d7 Z 12\u2032 symmetry, which also forbids, up to some high orders, operators that lead to proton decay. The resulting model has a total of nine parameters in the charged fermion and neutrino sectors, and hence is very predictive. In addition to the prediction for \u03b8 13\u2243 \u03b8 c\/3 2, the model gives rise to a sum rule, tan 2 \u03b8\u2299\u2243 tan 2 \u03b8\u2299, TBM\u2212 1 2 \u03b8 c cos \u03b2, which is a \u2026",

The ISS was carried out by the international community between NuFact05,(the 7th International Workshop on Neutrino Factories and Super-beams, Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Rome, 21\u201326 June 2005) and NuFact06 (Ivine, CA, 24\u201330 August 2006). The physics case for an extensive experimental programme to understand the properties of the neutrino is presented and the role of high-precision measurements of neutrino oscillations within this programme is discussed in detail. The performance of second-generation super-beam experiments, beta-beam facilities and the Neutrino Factory are evaluated and a quantitative comparison of the discovery potential of the three classes of facility is presented.

            "In this paper we describe a search for supersymmetry (SUSY) in final states with a single electron or muon, multiple jets, including some identified as originating from b quarks (b jets), and missing transverse energy. The search is based on the full set of data recorded with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of ffiffiffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV during 2011, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4: 98 \u0118 0: 11 fb \u01041. The search for new-physics phenomena in events with third-generation quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is motivated by various extensions [1\u20135] of the standard model (SM). Among these, supersymmetric models are regarded as attractive, because they can resolve the hierarchy problem and may permit the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions [6\u201310]. Supersymmetry predicts that for each particle in the SM there exists a partner particle, often referred to as a sparticle, with identical gauge quantum numbers but with a spin that differs by 1= 2. Assuming R parity conservation [11], sparticles are produced in pairs, and their decay chains terminate with the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In some scenarios the LSP is the lightest neutralino",
