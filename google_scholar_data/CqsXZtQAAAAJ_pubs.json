            "The equation of state of a system of fermions in a uniform magnetic field is obtained in terms of the thermodynamic quantities of the theory by using functional methods. It is shown that the breaking of the O (3) rotational symmetry by the magnetic field results in a pressure anisotropy, which leads to the distinction between longitudinal-and transverse-to-the-field pressures. A criterion to find the threshold field at which the asymmetric regime becomes significant is discussed. This threshold magnetic field is shown to be the same as the one required for the pure field contribution to the energy and pressures to be of the same order as the matter contribution. A graphical representation of the field-dependent anisotropic equation of state of the fermion system is given. Estimates of the upper limit for the inner magnetic field in self-bound stars, as well as in gravitationally bound stars with inhomogeneous distributions of mass \u2026",

To reliably predict astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity, a better understanding of the role of the star\u2019s magnetic field in the color-superconducting phase that is realized in the core is required. This paper is an initial step in that direction. The field scales at which the different magnetic phases of a color superconductor with three quark flavors can be realized are investigated.

Momentum images have also been taken with two-color (800 nm+ 400 nm) pulses on Xe targets. A strong dependence of the spectra on the relative phase of the two colors is observed in the rescattering region.
