Employing techniques similar to those we previously published, we observe a signal consistent with t t decay to WWb b, but inconsistent with the background prediction by 4.8 \u03c3. Additional evidence for the top quark is provided by a peak in the reconstructed mass distribution. We measure the top quark mass to be 176\u00b18 (stat)\u00b110 (syst) GeV\/c 2, and the t t production cross section to be 6.8\u2212 2.4+ 3.6 pb.",

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065.

In the (e, \u03bc)+ \u03bd+ jets channel we search for b quarks from t decays via secondary vertex identification and via semileptonic decays of the b and cascade c quarks. In the dilepton final states we find two events with a background of 0. 56\u2212 0.13+ 0.25 events. In the e, \u03bc+ \u03bd+ jets channel with a b identified via a secondary vertex, we find six events with a background of 2.3\u00b10.3. With a b identified via a semileptonic decay, we find seven events with a background of 3.1\u00b10.3. The secondary vertex and semileptonic-decay samples have three events in common.

The J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8 (2 S) mesons are reconstructed using their \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay modes. We have measured the inclusive production cross section for both mesons as a function of their transverse momentum in the central region,| \u03b7|< 0.6. We also measure the fraction of these events originating from b hadrons. We thus extract individual cross sections for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8 (2 S) mesons from b-quark decays and prompt production. We find a large excess (approximately a factor of 50) of direct \u03c8 (2 S) production compared with predictions from the color singlet model.",

The objectives of the Observatory are to probe the origin and characteristics of cosmic rays above 1017 eV and to study the interactions of these, the most energetic particles observed in nature. The Auger design features an array of 1660 water Cherenkov particle detector stations spread over 3000 km2 overlooked by 24 air fluorescence telescopes. In addition, three high elevation fluorescence telescopes overlook a 23.5 km2, 61-detector infilled array with 750 m spacing. The Observatory has been in successful operation since completion in 2008 and has recorded data from an exposure exceeding 40,000 km2 sr yr. This paper describes the design and performance of the detectors, related subsystems and infrastructure that make up the Observatory.",

Almost 4000 events above 10 18 eV observed by the fluorescence detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory in coincidence with at least one surface detector station are selected for the analysis. The average shower maximum was found to evolve with energy at a rate of (106\u2212 21+ 35) g\/cm 2\/decade below 10 18.24\u00b10.05 eV, and (24\u00b13) g\/cm 2\/decade above this energy.

Based on fluorescence observations in coincidence with at least one surface detector we derive a spectrum for energies above 10 18 eV. We also update the previously published energy spectrum obtained with the surface detector array. The two spectra are combined addressing the systematic uncertainties and, in particular, the influence of the energy resolution on the spectral shape. The spectrum can be described by a broken power law E\u2212 \u03b3 with index \u03b3= 3.3 below the ankle which is measured at log 10 (E ankle\/eV)= 18.6. Above the ankle the spectrum is described by a power law with index 2.6 followed by a flux suppression, above about log 10 (E\/eV)= 19.5, detected with high statistical significance.",
