If two particles collide and scatter, the process that results in the detection of the first particle in one direction and the second particle in another direction interferes quantum mechanically with the physically indistinguishable process where the roles of the particles are reversed. For bosons such as photons, a constructive interference between probability amplitudes can enhance the probability, relative to classical expectations, that both are detected in the same direction\u2014this is known as \u2018bunching\u2019. But for fermions such as electrons, a destructive interference should suppress this probability (\u2018anti-bunching\u2019); this interference is the origin of the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two electrons can never occupy the same state.

We report here on a new application for these devices. We operated an ultraclean, room-temperature bubble chamber containing 1.5 kilograms of superheated CF3I, a target maximally sensitive to spin-dependent and -independent weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) couplings. An extreme intrinsic insensitivity to the backgrounds that commonly limit direct searches for dark matter was measured in this device under operating conditions leading to the detection of low-energy nuclear recoils like those expected from WIMPs. Improved limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton scattering cross section were extracted during our experiments, excluding this type of coupling as a possible explanation for a recent claim of particle \u2026",

The long storage time and spatial localization of trapped molecular ions provides an opportunity for multi-step cooling strategies, but also requires careful consideration of rare molecular transitions. We briefly summarize the requirements that a diatomic molecule must meet for laser cooling, and we identify a few potential molecular ion candidates. We then carry out a detailed computational study of the candidates BH+ and AlH+, including improved ab initio calculations of the electronic state potential energy surfaces and transition rates for rare dissociation events. On the basis of an analysis of the population dynamics, we determine which transitions must be addressed for laser cooling, and compare experimental schemes using continuous-wave and pulsed lasers.",

            "We study the prospects for detecting weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in a number of phenomenological scenarios, with a detector composed of a target simultaneously sensitive to both spin-dependent and spin-independent couplings, as is the case of COUPP (Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics). First, we show that sensitivity to both couplings optimizes chances of initial WIMP detection. Second, we demonstrate that, in case of detection, a comparison of the signal on two complementary targets, such as in COUPP CF 3 I and C 4 F 10 bubble chambers, allows a significantly more precise determination of the dark matter axial and scalar couplings. This strategy would provide crucial information on the nature of the WIMPs and possibly allow discrimination between neutralino and Kaluza-Klein dark matter.",
