We used fluorescence microscopy of live fission yeast cells to observe that membrane-bound nodes containing myosin were broadly distributed around the cell equator and assembled into a contractile ring through stochastic motions, after a meshwork of dynamic actin filaments appeared. Analysis of node motions and numerical simulations supported a mechanism whereby transient connections are established when myosins in one node capture and exert force on actin filaments growing from other nodes.",

We modeled how the elongation rate depends on the concentrations of profilin and actin for four different formins. We assume that (1) FH2 domains are in rapid equilibrium among conformations that block or allow actin addition and that (2) profilin-actin is transferred rapidly to the barbed end from multiple profilin binding sites in formin FH1 domains. In agreement with previous experiments discussed below, we find an optimal profilin concentration with a maximal elongation rate that can exceed the rate of actin alone. High profilin concentrations suppress elongation, largely because free profilin displaces profilin-actin from FH1. The model supports a common polymerization mechanism for the four formin FH1FH2 constructs with differences attributed to varying parameter values. The mechanism does not \u2026",

From the dependence of the elongation rate on the actin concentration and direct observations of depolymerizing filaments, we measured the polymerization rate constants of ADP-actin and ADP-Pi-actin. Saturating phosphate reduces the critical concentration for polymerization of Mg-ADP-actin from 1.8 to 0.06 \u03bcM almost entirely by reducing the dissociation rate constants at both ends. Saturating phosphate increases the barbed end association rate constant of Mg-ADP-actin 15%, but this value is still threefold less than that of ATP-actin. Thus, ATP hydrolysis without phosphate dissociation must change the conformation of polymerized actin. Analysis of depolymerization experiments in the presence of phosphate suggests that phosphate dissociation near the terminal subunits is much \u2026",

We developed an interactive software tool for segmentation, tracking, and visualization of individual fibers. Open active contours are parametric curves that deform to minimize the sum of an external energy derived from the image and an internal bending and stretching energy. The external energy generates (i) forces that attract the contour toward the central bright line of a filament in the image, and (ii) forces that stretch the active contour toward the ends of bright ridges. Images of simulated semiflexible polymers with known bending and torsional rigidity are analyzed to validate the method.

Here, we model these kinetics, accounting for all relevant steps revealed by experiment: polymerization, depolymerization, random ATP hydrolysis, and release of phosphate (Pi). We relate filament growth rates to the dynamics of ATP\u2013actin and ADP\u2013Pi\u2013actin caps that develop at filament ends. At the critical concentration of the barbed end, ccrit, we find a short ATP cap and a long fluctuation-stabilized ADP\u2013Pi cap. We show that growth rates and the critical concentration at the barbed end are intimately related to cap structure and dynamics.

Concentrations of a fluorescent marker for active Cdc42, Cdc42 protein, Cdc42-activator Scd1, and scaffold protein Scd2 exhibited anticorrelated fluctuations and oscillations with a 5-minute average period at polarized cell tips. These dynamics indicate competition for active Cdc42 or its regulators and the presence of positive and delayed negative feedbacks. Cdc42 oscillations and spatial distribution were sensitive to the amounts of Cdc42-activator Gef1 and to the activity of Cdc42-dependent kinase Pak1, a negative regulator. Feedbacks regulating Cdc42 oscillations and spatial self-organization appear to provide a flexible mechanism for fission yeast cells to explore polarization states and to control their morphology.",
