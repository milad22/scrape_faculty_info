            "We demonstrate a new, versatile class of nanoscale chemical sensors based on single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) as the chemical recognition site and single-walled carbon nanotube field effect transistors (swCN-FETs) as the electronic read-out component. swCN-FETs with a nanoscale coating of ss-DNA respond to gas odors that do not cause a detectable conductivity change in bare devices. Responses of ss-DNA\/swCN-FETs differ in sign and magnitude for different gases and can be tuned by choosing the base sequence of the ss-DNA. ss-DNA\/swCN-FET sensors detect a variety of odors, with rapid response and recovery times on the scale of seconds. The sensor surface is self-regenerating:\u2009 samples maintain a constant response with no need for sensor refreshing through at least 50 gas exposure cycles. This remarkable set of attributes makes sensors based on ss-DNA decorated nanotubes very promising \u2026",

Fiber diameters near 5 nm are obtained for optimized process parameters. Scanning conductance microscopy (SCM) shows that fibers with diameter below 15 nm are electrically insulating; the small diameter may allow complete dedoping in air or be smaller than phase-separated grains of PAn and PEO. Electrical contacts to nanofibers are made by shadow mask evaporation with no chemical or thermal damage to the fibers. Single fiber I\u2013V characteristics show that thin fibers conduct more poorly than thick ones, in agreement with SCM data. I\u2013Vs of asymmetric fibers are rectifying, consistent with formation of Schottky barriers at the nanofiber-metal contacts.",

Hydrogels are frequently employed for extracellular matrix functionalization and to provide appropriate mechanical cues. It is challenging, however, to achieve structural integrity and retain bioactive molecules in hydrogels for complex tissue formation that may take months to develop. This work aims to investigate mechanical and biochemical characteristics of silk hydrogels for soft tissue engineering, specifically for the nervous system. The stiffness of 1 to 8% silk hydrogels, measured by atomic force microscopy, is 4 to 33 kPa. The structural integrity of silk gels is maintained throughout embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion (cDRG) explant culture over 4 days whereas fibrin and collagen gels decrease in mass over time.

Millions of human platelets were produced and showed to be functional based on multiple activation tests.

Here, we combine atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy with fluorescence microscopy to produce systematic, high-resolution elasticity maps for three different types of live neuronal cells: cortical (embryonic rat), embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion, and P-19 (mouse embryonic carcinoma stem cells) neurons. We measure how the stiffness of neurons changes both during neurite outgrowth and upon disruption of microtubules of the cell. We find reversible local stiffening of the cell during growth, and show that the increase in local elastic modulus is primarily due to the formation of microtubules. We also report that cortical and P-19 neurons have similar elasticity maps \u2026",

Over the last few years there has been significant progress in our understanding of the role played by the substrate stiffness in neuronal growth, of the cell-substrate adhesion forces, of the generation of traction forces during axonal elongation, and of the relationships between the neuron soma elastic properties and its health. The particular capabilities of the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), such as high spatial resolution, high degree of control over the magnitude and orientation of the applied forces, minimal sample damage, and the ability to image and interact with cells in physiologically relevant conditions make this technique particularly suitable for measuring mechanical properties of living neuronal cells.
