            "Orbital reconstructions and covalent bonding must be considered as important factors in the rational design of oxide heterostructures with engineered physical properties. We have investigated the interface between high-temperature superconducting (Y,Ca)Ba2Cu3O7 and metallic La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 by resonant x-ray spectroscopy. A charge of about \u20130.2 electron is transferred from Mn to Cu ions across the interface and induces a major reconstruction of the orbital occupation and orbital symmetry in the interfacial CuO2 layers. In particular, the Cu d3z2\u2013r2 orbital, which is fully occupied and electronically inactive in the bulk, is partially occupied at the interface. Supported by exact-diagonalization calculations, these data indicate the formation of a strong chemical bond between Cu and Mn atoms across the interface. Orbital reconstructions and associated covalent bonding are thus important factors in determining \u2026",

Oxide interfaces are of interest because in many transition-metal compounds the electrons are strongly correlated: the motion of one carrier depends crucially on the motion of all the others. Strongly correlated electron systems support interesting and potentially useful effects, including magnetism with high Curie temperatures, superconductivity with high transition temperatures, metal\u2013insulator transitions and multiferroicity. So far, however, research into the correlated electron physics of transitionmetal oxides, as well as their integration into potential applications, has been hindered by materials difficulties.

In bulk form, transition metal oxides exhibit a remarkable range of magnetic, superconducting, and multiferroic phases that are of great scientific interest and are potentially capable of providing innovative energy, security, electronics, and medical technology platforms. In superlattices new states may emerge at the interfaces where dissimilar materials meet.

Following a brief description of the present paradigms of electronic behavior, we focus on the physics of rare-earth nickelates as an archetype of complexity emerging within the charge transfer regime. The intriguing prospect of realizing the physics of high-Tc cuprates through heterostructuring resulted in a massive endeavor to epitaxially stabilize these materials in ultrathin form. A plethora of new phenomena unfolded in such artificial structures due to the effect of epitaxial strain, quantum confinement, and interfacial charge transfer.
