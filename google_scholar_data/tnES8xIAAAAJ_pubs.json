            "Physical systems usually exhibit quantum behavior, such as superpositions and entanglement, only when they are sufficiently decoupled from a lossy environment. Paradoxically, a specially engineered interaction with the environment can become a resource for the generation and protection of quantum states. This notion can be generalized to the confinement of a system into a manifold of quantum states, consisting of all coherent superpositions of multiple stable steady states. We have confined the state of a superconducting resonator to the quantum manifold spanned by two coherent states of opposite phases and have observed a Schr\u00f6dinger cat state spontaneously squeeze out of vacuum before decaying into a classical mixture. This experiment points toward robustly encoding quantum information in multidimensional steady-state manifolds.",

The distinct combination of spin, valley, and orbital degeneracies in bilayer graphene is predicted to produce an unusual and tunable sequence of FQH states. Here, we present local electronic compressibility measurements of the FQH effect in the lowest Landau level of bilayer graphene. We observe incompressible FQH states at filling factors \u03bd = 2p + 2\/3, with hints of additional states appearing at \u03bd = 2p + 3\/5, where p = \u20132, \u20131, 0, and 1.

The oxidation of the Co nanoparticles used in this study is carefully controlled, yielding highly crystalline and oriented interfaces. The dimensions of the core and shell are determined from magnetization and small angle x-ray scattering measurements. The exchange bias field in Co\/CoO core-shell nanoparticles depends nonmonotonically on the CoO shell thickness, reaching a maximum value of\u2248 7 kOe at 30 K when the core and shell dimensions are similar. We propose that lattice strain induces a net moment at the core-shell interface, and it is the variation of this moment with strain, which is responsible for the vanishing of H EB at both large and small Co shell thicknesses.",

Starting with an amorphous Ni powder, we demonstrate that oxidation at 900 C produces faceted NiO nanocrystals with sizes ranging from 20 to 60 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements indicate near-perfect atomic order, truncated by (200) surfaces. Magnetization measurements reveal that the N\u00e9el temperature of these NiO nanoparticles is 480 K, substantially reduced by finite-size effects from the bulk value of 523 K. The magnetization of these faceted NiO nanoparticles does not saturate in fields as large as 14 T while a loop offset is observed which increases from 1000 Oe at 300 K to its maximum value of 3500 Oe at 50 K.

This conditional state, when it reaches the cavity-following, phase-sensitive amplifier, matches its measured observable, namely, the in phase quadrature. In a setup where several qubits are coupled to the same readout resonator, we show it is possible to measure the state of a target qubit with minimal dephasing of the other qubits. Our results suggest novel directions for faster readout of superconducting qubits and implementations of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes.",

The LEGO\u00ae-like nature of superconducting circuits makes them particularly suited for building and coupling artificial atoms. Here, we introduce an artificial molecule, composed of two strongly coupled fluxonium atoms, which possesses a tunable magnetic moment. Using an applied external flux, one can tune the molecule between two regimes: one in which the ground-excited state manifold has a magnetic dipole moment and one in which the ground-excited state manifold has only a magnetic quadrupole moment. By varying the applied external flux, we find the coherence of the molecule to be limited by local flux noise. The ability to engineer and control artificial molecules paves the way for building more complex circuits for quantum simulation and protected qubits.",
