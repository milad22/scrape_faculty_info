Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 10 9 M\u2609 to z\u2248 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z\u2248 8.

In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra \u2026",

Recent determinations of the pulsar distribution have made the discrepancy even more apparent. The problem is shown to be plausibly solved by a variation in the WCO-to-N(H2) scaling factor. If this factor increases by a factor of 5\u201310 from the inner to the outer Galaxy, as expected from the Galactic metallicity gradient, we show that the source distribution required to match the radial gradient of \u03b3-rays\u2000can be reconciled with the distribution of supernova remnants as traced by current studies of pulsars. The resulting model fits the EGRET \u03b3-ray\u2000profiles extremely well in longitude, and reproduces the mid-latitude inner Galaxy intensities better than previous models.",

Here we investigate the impact of the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterizing the cosmological redshift drift. We consider the Ly\u03b1 forest in the redshift range 2 < z < 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high-redshift QSOs as the most suitable targets for a redshift drift experiment.

We combine the effort from 10 different teams, who computed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts. Each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, and parameter grid. The combination of results using the same underlying stellar isochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and other choices. Thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test the effect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar mass estimate. The choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have the largest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largest distributions around \u2026",

            "A survey of CO emission in 29 far-IR selected elliptical galaxies resulted in 16 detections, of which 3 remain tentative. The molecular gas masses range from 2x10^ 6^ M sun _ to 1x10^ 9^ M sun _, and appear to be unrelated to the underlying stellar population. This suggests an external origin of the gas. Most of the elliptical galaxies with a molecular gas component have a gas-to-dust mass ratio of~ 700, where dust masses are derived from the IRAS fluxes, but some appear to have a ratio as low as 50. A small apparent gas-to-dust mass ratio is also found for some late-type galaxies, and is correlated with a low dust temperature. We suggest that a large part of the far-infrared emission from these galaxies (both early-and late-types) comes from dust associated with the atomic gas component rather than star forming regions associated with the molecular gas, and that they contain a cold dust component.
