            "Temperature dependent optical conductivities and dc resistivity of c-axis oriented superconducting (T c= 39.6 K) MgB 2 films (\u223c 450 nm) have been measured. The normal state ab-plane optical conductivities can be described by the Drude model with a temperature independent Drude plasma frequency of \u03c9 p, D= 13 600\u00b1100 cm\u2212 1 or 1.68\u00b10.01 eV. The normal state resistivity is fitted by the Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen formula with an electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb tr= 0.13\u00b10.02. The optical conductivity spectra below T c of these films suggest that MgB 2 is a multigap superconductor.",

            "The transport and complex optical properties of the electron-doped iron-arsenic superconductor BaFe 1.85 Co 0.15 As 2 with T c= 25 K have been examined in the Fe-As planes above and below T c. A Bloch-Gr\u00fcneisen analysis of the resistivity yields a weak electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb p h\u2243 0.2. The low-frequency optical response in the normal state appears to be dominated by the electron pocket and may be described by a weakly interacting Fermi liquid with a Drude plasma frequency of \u03c9 p, D\u2243 7840 cm\u2212 1 (\u2243 0.972 eV) and scattering rate 1\/\u03c4 D\u2243 126 cm\u2212 1 (\u2243 15 meV) just above T c. The frequency-dependent scattering rate 1\/\u03c4 (\u03c9) has kinks at\u2243 12 and 55 meV that appear to be related to bosonic excitations. Below T c the majority of the superconducting plasma frequency originates from the electron pocket and is estimated to be \u03c9 p, S\u2243 5200 cm\u2212 1 (\u03bb 0\u2243 3000 \u00c5) for T\u2aa1 T c, indicating that less than \u2026",

A prominent in-plane infrared-active mode is observed at 253 cm\u2212 1 (31.4 meV) at 295 K. The frequency of this vibration shifts discontinuously at T N; for T< T N the frequency of this mode displays almost no temperature dependence, yet it nearly doubles in intensity. This anomalous behavior appears to be a consequence of orbital ordering in the Fe-As layers.",

This procedure is based on inverse theory and will be shown to be superior to previous techniques. Numerical implementation of the algorithm is presented in detail and then used to accurately determine the doping and temperature dependence of the spectral function in several families of high-T c superconductors. Principal limitations of extracting \u03b1 2 F (\u03c9) from experimental data will be pointed out. We directly compare the IR and angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy \u03b1 2 F (\u03c9) and discuss the resonance structure in the spectra in terms of existing theoretical models.",
