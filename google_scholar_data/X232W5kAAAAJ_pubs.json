            "We study the idea of a composite Higgs in the framework of a five-dimensional AdS theory. We present the minimal model of the Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson in which electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically via top loop effects, all flavour problems are solved, and contributions to electroweak precision observables are below experimental bounds. Since the 5D theory is weakly coupled, we are able to fully determine the Higgs potential and other physical quantities. The lightest resonances are expected to have a mass around 2 TeV and should be discovered at the LHC. The top sector is mostly composite and deviations from Standard Model couplings are expected.",

In this scenario, the production via q q annihilation and decays to the conventional photon and lepton channels are highly suppressed. However, we show that graviton production via gluon fusion followed by decay to longitudinal Z\/W can be significant; vector boson fusion is found to be a subdominant production mode.

In this paper, using a spurion analysis, we systematically study the flavor structure of models that belong to the above class. In particular we find that the profiles of the zero modes, which are similar in all these models, essentially control the underlying flavor structure. This implies that our results are robust and model independent in this class of models. We discuss in detail the origin of the signals in B physics. We also briefly study other new physics signatures that arise in rare K decays (K\u2192 \u03c0 \u03bd \u03bd), in rare top decays [t\u2192 c \u03b3 (Z, gluon)], and the possibility of C P asymmetries in D 0 decays to C P eigenstates such as K S \u03c0 0 and others.

A combination of baryon number and S U (3) color ensures its stability. Its relic density can easily be of the right value for masses in the 10 GeV\u2013few TeV range. An exciting aspect of these models is that the entire parameter space will be tested at near future dark matter direct detection experiments. Other exotic GUT partners of the top quark are also light and can be produced at high energy colliders with distinctive signatures.",

            "A complete analysis of the electroweak precision observables is performed within a recently proposed minimal composite Higgs model, realized as a 5-dimensional warped compactification. In particular, we compute Z\u2192 b b\u00af and the one-loop correction to the \u03c1 parameter. We find that oblique data can be easily reproduced without a significant amount of tuning in the parameters of the model, while Z\u2192 b b\u00af imposes a stronger constraint. As a consequence of the latter, some of the new fermionic resonances must have mass around 4 TeV, which corresponds to an electroweak fine tuning of a few percent. Other resonances, such as Z\u2032, can be lighter in sizeable portions of the parameter space. We discuss in detail the origin of the Z\u2192 b b\u00af constraint and we suggest several possible avenues beyond the minimal model for weakening it.",
