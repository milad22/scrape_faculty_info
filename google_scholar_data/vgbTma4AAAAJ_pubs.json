            "Extensive research on two-dimensional (2D) materials has triggered the renaissance of an old topic, that is, the intercalation and exfoliation of layer materials. Such top-down exfoliation produced 2D materials and their dispersions have several advantages including low cost, scalable production capability, solution processability, and versatile functionalities stemming from the large number of species of layer materials, and show promising potential in many applications. In recent years, many new methods have been developed for exfoliating layer materials to 2D materials for different application purposes. In this review the different exfoliation approaches are first systematically analyzed from the viewpoint of methodology, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are compared. Second, the assembly of exfoliated 2D materials into macrostructures by solution-based techniques is summarized. Third \u2026",

            "The development of abundant and cheap electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has attracted increasing attention over recent years. However, to achieve low-cost HER electrocatalysis, especially in alkaline media, is still a big challenge due to the sluggish water dissociation kinetics as well as the poor long-term stability of catalysts. In this paper we report the design and synthesis of a two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 confined Co(OH)2 nanoparticle electrocatalyst, which accelerates water dissociation and exhibits good durability in alkaline solutions, leading to significant improvement in HER performance. A two-step method was used to synthesize the electrocatalyst, starting with the lithium intercalation of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets followed by Co2+ exchange in alkaline media to form MoS2 intercalated with Co(OH)2 nanoparticles (denoted Co-Ex-MoS2), which was fully characterized by \u2026",

Here we address these challenges by exploring the roles of morphology and surface chemistry, and develop inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Three model electrocatalysts are flat platinum foil, molybdenum disulfide microspheres, and molybdenum disulfide microspheres modified by molybdenum carbide nanoparticles. The last catalyst is highly active for hydrogen evolution independent of pH, with low overpotentials of 227 mV in acidic medium and 220 mV in alkaline medium at a high current density of 1000 mA cm\u2212 2, because of enhanced transfer of mass (reactants and hydrogen bubbles) and fast reaction kinetics due to surface oxygen \u2026",

Consequently, our nanosample exhibits over 125% enhancement in DCHT coefficient.

Both the different anodizing processes and different polymeric coatings of aluminum alloy were investigated. The effects of different anodizing conditions, such as electrolyte concentration, anodization time and current on the superhydrophobic surface were discussed. The results showed that a good superhydrophobic surface was facilely fabricated by polypropylene (PP) coating after anodizing. The optimum conditions for anodizing were determined by orthogonal experiments. When the concentration of oxalic acid was 10 g\/L, the concentration of NaCl was 1.25 g\/L, anodization time was 40 min, and anodization current was 0.4 A, the best superhydrophobic surface on aluminum alloy with the contact angle (CA) of 162\u00b0 and the sliding angle of 2\u00b0 was obtained.
