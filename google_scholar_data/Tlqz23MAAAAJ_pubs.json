            "We present the results for CAPRI Round 30, the first joint CASP\u2010CAPRI experiment, which brought together experts from the protein structure prediction and protein\u2013protein docking communities. The Round comprised 25 targets from amongst those submitted for the CASP11 prediction experiment of 2014. The targets included mostly homodimers, a few homotetramers, and two heterodimers, and comprised protein chains that could readily be modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank. On average 24 CAPRI groups and 7 CASP groups submitted docking predictions for each target, and 12 CAPRI groups per target participated in the CAPRI scoring experiment. In total more than 9500 models were assessed against the 3D structures of the corresponding target complexes. Results show that the prediction of homodimer assemblies by homology modeling techniques and docking calculations is quite \u2026",

In the absence of precise information, nanovesicles built of amphiphilic \u201clipid-like\u201d peptides are generally assumed to resemble liposomes that are organized from bilayers of peptides with a tail-to-tail ordering.

These modifications either entail amino-acid substitution of S4 subsite residues Tyr99 and\/or Phe174 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), or extension of the 99-loop that borders the S4 subsite. The latter modifications led to the engineering of a factor Xa variant that is able to support coagulation in human plasma spiked with (supra-) physiological concentrations of direct factor Xa inhibitors.
