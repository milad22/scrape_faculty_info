Moreover, the binding affinity, kinetics, excitation\/emission wavelength, and localization to a specific organelle can easily be optimized by using well-established design strategies. 1\u2212 6 Thus, a diverse array of probes can be designed to target various biomolecules and organelles. 7, 8 Most of these have been developed by employing common fluorophores, such as fluorescein, coumarin, BODIPY, and rhodamine. 9 These are useful for one-photon microscopy (OPM), which utilizes one photon (OP) of UV\u2212 visible light (350\u2212 550 nm). To date, thousands of OP probes have been developed, of which about 2000 have been commercialized. However, the use of OPM is limited to \u2026",

            "  Optical imaging with fluorescence microscopy is a vital tool in the study of living systems. The most common method for cell imaging, one-photon microscopy (OPM), uses a single photon of higher energy to excite the fluorophore. However, two-photon microscopy (TPM), which uses two photons of lower energy as the excitation source, is growing in popularity among biologists because of several distinct advantages. Using TPM, researchers can image intact tissue for a long period of time with minimum interference from tissue preparation artifacts, self-absorption, autofluorescence, photobleaching, and photodamage. However, to make TPM a more versatile tool in biology, researchers need a wider variety of two-photon probes for specific applications.In this Account, we describe a series of two-photon probes that we developed that can visualize the distribution of intracellular metal ions, acidic vesicles, and lipid \u2026",

The higher level of expression of inhibitory NK receptors and the lower level of expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors observed in the CD56\u2013 NK fraction compared with that of CD56+ NK cells was associated with extremely poor in vitro cytotoxic function of this subset. In addition, the secretion of certain cytokines known to be important in initiating antiviral immune responses was markedly reduced in the CD56\u2013, as compared with the CD56+ NK cell subset.

            "Fully printed transistors are a key component of ubiquitous flexible electronics. In this work, the advantages of an inverse gravure printing technique and the solution processing of semiconductor-enriched single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are combined to fabricate fully printed thin-film transistors on mechanically flexible substrates. The fully printed transistors are configured in a top-gate device geometry and utilize silver metal electrodes and an inorganic\/organic high-\u03ba (\u223c17) gate dielectric. The devices exhibit excellent performance for a fully printed process, with mobility and on\/off current ratio of up to \u223c9 cm2\/(V s) and 105, respectively. Extreme bendability is observed, without measurable change in the electrical performance down to a small radius of curvature of 1 mm. Given the high performance of the transistors, our high-throughput printing process serves as an enabling nanomanufacturing scheme \u2026",
