            "Spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene can be greatly enhanced by proximity coupling it to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WSe2. We find that the strength of the acquired SOC in graphene depends on the stacking order of the heterostructures when using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer, i.e., SiO2\/graphene\/WSe2\/h-BN exhibiting stronger SOC than SiO2\/WSe2\/graphene\/h-BN. We utilize photoluminescence (PL) as an indicator to characterize the interaction between graphene and monolayer WSe2 grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observe much stronger PL quenching in the SiO2\/graphene\/WSe2\/h-BN stack than in the SiO2\/WSe2\/graphene\/h-BN stack and, correspondingly, a much larger weak antilocalization (WAL) effect or stronger induced SOC in the former than in the latter. We attribute these two effects to the interlayer distance between graphene and WSe2 \u2026",

            "Spin orbit assisted Mott insulators such as sodium iridate (Na 2 IrO 3) have been an important subject of study in recent years. In these materials, the interplay of electronic correlations, spin-orbit coupling, crystal field effects, and a honeycomb arrangement of ions bring exciting ground states, predicted in the frame of the Kitaev model. The insulating character of Na 2 IrO 3 has hampered its integration to an electronic device, desirable for applications, such as the manipulation of quasiparticles interesting for topological quantum computing. Here we show through electronic transport measurements supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, that electronic transport in Na 2 IrO 3 is ruled by variable range hopping and it is strongly dependent on the magnetic ordering transition known for bulk Na 2 IrO 3, as well as on external electric fields. Electronic transport measurements allow \u2026",
