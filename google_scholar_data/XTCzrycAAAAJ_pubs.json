The results indicate a strong nonlinearity (bowing) in the compositional dependence of these quantities. Such behavior is not predicted by electronic structure calculations within the virtual crystal approximation. The bowing parameters for Ge 1\u2212 y Sn y alloys show an intriguing correlation with the corresponding bowing parameters in the Ge 1\u2212 x Si x system, suggesting a scaling behavior for the electronic properties that is the analog of the scaling behavior found earlier for the vibrational properties. A direct consequence of this scaling behavior is a significant reduction (relative to prior theoretical estimates within the virtual crystal approximation) of the concentration y c for a crossover from an indirect-to a direct-gap system.",

In this letter, we discuss the synthesis of pseudomorphic Si1\u2212yCy and Si1\u2212x\u2212yGexCy alloy layers on a silicon (100) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy using solid sources and the controlled strain compensation that results from the introduction of the ternary system. The introduction of C into substitutional sites in the crystal lattice is kinetically stabilized by low\u2010temperature growth conditions (400\u2013550\u2009\u00b0C) against thermodynamically favored silicon\u2010carbide phases. The lattice constant in Ge is about 4% larger than in Si, whereas in diamond it is 52% smaller. Consequently, the compressive strain caused by 10.8% Ge in a pseudomorphic Si1\u2212xGex alloy can be compensated by adding about 1% carbon into substitutional lattice sites of the film assuming Vegard\u2019s law of linear change of the lattice constant in the alloy as a function of the \u2026",

Perfectly epitaxial diamond-cubic Ge1\u2212xSnx alloys are grown directly on Si(100) and exhibit high thermal stability, superior crystallinity, and crystallographic and optical properties, such as adjustable band gaps and lattice constants. These properties are completely characterized by Rutherford backscattering, low-energy secondary ion mass spectrometry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction (rocking curves), as well as infrared and Raman spectroscopies and spectroscopic ellipsometry.

By performing a line-shape analysis of the observed structures, the interband critical-point (CP) parameters (strength, threshold energy, broadening, and excitonic phase angle) and their temperature dependence have been determined. Special emphasis is put on the E 0\u2032, E 0\u2032+ \u0394 0\u2032, and E 2 CP's. We determine the spin-orbit splitting of \u0393 15 c to be \u0394 0\u2032= 160\u00b110 meV. The observed decrease in energy of the CP's (after correction for the effect of thermal expansion) and the corresponding increase in broadening with increasing temperature agree reasonable well with results of a calculation that takes into account the Debye-Waller and self-energy terms of the deformation-potential-type electron-phonon interaction.

The intervalley deformation potentials (IDPs) that we obtain at high\u2010symmetry points are in good agreement with previous calculations. We find that the IDPs show a strong dependence on the wave vector of the intervalley phonon, therefore a numerical integration over the Brillouin zone (e.g., with the tetrahedron method) is necessary to obtain realistic scattering rates that can be compared with those obtained from experiments. We calculate the lifetimes of electrons at the L and X valleys as a function of temperature (L: 2.2\u00b10.5 ps; X: 130\u00b120 fs at room temperature) and discuss our results in comparison with recent ultrafast laser experiments and Monte Carlo simulations.

            "We calculate the isotope and temperature shifts of the indirect and direct band gaps in natural silicon (M= 28.09 u), in natural diamond C 12 and its isotope C 13, in natural germanium (M= 72.59 u), and the isotope Ge 70, and in the isotope mixture Ge 75.7, due to the deformation-potential-type electron-phonon interaction (within the pseudopotential-bond-charge-model framework). We compare these results to existing experimental information and to data obtained by us with spectroscopic ellipsometry. We find that there are small, but noticeable shifts of the band gaps between different isotopes (about 13 meV for diamond, 1 meV for germanium). The isotopic influence on the broadenings of the E 1 transition in Ge is also observed.",

In the bulk crystals, we analyze the interband transitions in the spectra to determine the critical-point parameters. To interpret these transitions, we performed band structure calculations based on ab initio pseudopotentials within the local-density approximation. The dielectric function was also calculated within this framework and compared with our ellipsometry data. In the FTIR ellipsometry data, we notice a strong lattice absorption peak due to oxygen-related vibrations. Two longitudinal optic (LO) phonons were also identified. In SrTiO3 films on Si, the refractive index below the band gap decreases with decreasing thickness because of the increasing influence \u2026",

At a wavelength 351 nm, the optical penetration depth is extremely shallow (\u22485 nm). By varying the excitation from 351 to 514 nm, the optical penetration depth spans from 5 to 300 nm. Two sets of samples were examined. Thin layers grown using molecular beam epitaxy were coherently strained to match the lattice constant of the silicon substrate. Thick layers grown using organo\u2013metallic chemical vapor deposition were strain relaxed. For the thin, strained layers, visible excitation produces a spectrum, which is a superposition of the substrate and the epilayer phonon bands. Reducing the wavelength (and, consequently, penetration depth) allows us to isolate the epilayer spectrum. Phonon energies obtained using all excitation wavelengths agree.
