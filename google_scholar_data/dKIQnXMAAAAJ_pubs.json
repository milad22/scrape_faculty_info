            "We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5\u03c3 level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \u039bCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted \u201cbase \u039bCDM\u201d in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in \u2026",

BICEP2 and Keck Array have observed the same approximately 400 deg 2 patch of sky centered on RA 0 h, Dec.\u2212 57.5. The combined maps reach a depth of 57 nK deg in Stokes Q and U in a band centered at 150 GHz. Planck has observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353 GHz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 \u03bc K deg in Q and U at 143 GHz). We detect 150\u00d7 353 cross-correlation in B modes at high significance. We fit the single-and cross-frequency power spectra at frequencies\u2265 150 GHz to a lensed-\u039b CDM model that includes dust and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r), using a prior on the frequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous Planck analysis of other regions of the sky.

The data consist of 790 deg 2 of sky observed at 150 GHz during 2008 and 2009. Here we present the power spectrum over the multipole range 650< \u2113< 3000, where it is dominated by primary CMB anisotropy. We combine this power spectrum with the power spectra from the seven-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data release to constrain cosmological models. We find that the SPT and WMAP data are consistent with each other and, when combined, are well fit by a spatially flat, \u039bCDM cosmological model. The SPT+WMAP constraint on the spectral index of scalar fluctuations is n s= 0.9663\u00b10.0112.

One method involves a direct evaluation of the likelihood function, and the other is an estimator that is a minimum-variance weighted quadratic function of the data. Applied iteratively, the quadratic estimator is not distinct from likelihood analysis, but is rather a rapid means of finding the power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood function. Our results bear this out: direct evaluation and quadratic estimation converge to the same C l s. The quadratic estimator can also be used to determine directly cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. While the two methods both require O (N 3) operations, the quadratic is much faster, and both are applicable to datasets with arbitrary chopping \u2026",

The results are fully consistent with those reported using the data from the two previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the spectral index of scalar perturbations to be ns\u2004=\u20040.9649\u2005\u00b1\u20050.0042 at 68% CL.
