We show that a very natural coordinate system is suggested by the connection between the worldsheet renormalization group and spacetime physics. In this system only one field, the tachyon, condenses while all other fields have vanishing expectation values. These coordinates are also well-suited to the study of D-branes as solitons. We use them to show that the tension of the D25-brane is cancelled by tachyon condensation and compute exactly the profiles and tensions of lower dimensional D-branes.",

The full string theory in such vacua is``dual''to a theory without gravity in fewer dimensions. The dual theory is generically not a local quantum field theory. Excitations of the string vacuum, which can be studied in the weak coupling region using worldsheet methods, give rise to observables in the dual theory. An interesting example is string theory in the near-horizon background of parallel NS5-branes, the CHS model, which is dual to the decoupled NS5-brane theory (``little string theory''). This duality can be used to study some of the observables in this theory and some of their correlation functions. Another interesting example is the``old''matrix model, which gives a holographic description of two dimensional string theory.",

We find that in confining backgrounds there are generally two such surfaces. One consists of two disconnected components localized at the endpoints of the line segment. The other contains a tube connecting the two components. The disconnected surface dominates the entropy for l above a certain critical value l crit while the connected one dominates below that value.

            "We consider two-dimensional supergravity coupled to  matter. This system can also be interpreted as noncritical type 0 string theory in a two-dimensional target space. After reviewing and extending the traditional descriptions of this class of theories, we provide a matrix model description. The 0B theory is similar to the realization of two-dimensional bosonic string theory via matrix quantum mechanics in an inverted harmonic oscillator potential; the difference is that we expand around a non-perturbatively stable vacuum, where the matrix eigenvalues are equally distributed on both sides of the potential. The 0A theory is described by a quiver matrix model.",
