            "We briefly review our implementation of the real-space Green's function (RSGF) approach for calculations of X-ray spectra, focusing on recently developed parameter free models for dominant many-body effects. Although the RSGF approach has been widely used both for near edge (XANES) and extended (EXAFS) ranges, previous implementations relied on semi-phenomenological methods, e.g., the plasmon-pole model for the self-energy, the final-state rule for screened core hole effects, and the correlated Debye model for vibrational damping. Here we describe how these approximations can be replaced by efficient ab initio models including a many-pole model of the self-energy, inelastic losses and multiple-electron excitations; a linear response approach for the core hole; and a Lanczos approach for Debye\u2013Waller effects. We also discuss the implementation of these models and software improvements within \u2026",

            "There has been dramatic progress in recent years both in the calculation and interpretation of various x-ray spectroscopies. However, current theoretical calculations often use a number of simplified models to account for many-body effects, in lieu of first principles calculations. In an effort to overcome these limitations we describe in this article a number of recent advances in theory and in theoretical codes which offer the prospect of parameter free calculations that include the dominant many-body effects. These advances are based on ab initio calculations of the dielectric and vibrational response of a system. Calculations of the dielectric function over a broad spectrum yield system dependent self-energies and mean-free paths, as well as intrinsic losses due to multi-electron excitations. Calculations of the dynamical matrix yield vibrational damping in terms of multiple-scattering Debye\u2013Waller factors. Our ab initio \u2026",
