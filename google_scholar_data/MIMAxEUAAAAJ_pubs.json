Standard quantum chemistry software is used to calculate the self-consistent field using density functional theory (DFT). Such close coupling to standard quantum chemistry software not only makes the procedure simple to implement but also makes the relation between the I\u2013V characteristics and the chemistry of the molecule more obvious.

The NDR peaks show a clear polarity reversal, appearing for positive bias on a p-doped and negative for an n-doped substrate, a feature that is in agreement with recent experiments by Guisinger et al.

In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell\u2019s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design.

Couplings among the subbands are generated for two reasons: due to spatial variations of the confinement potential along the transport direction and due to nonalignment of the device coordinate system with the principal axes of the constant energy conduction-band ellipsoids. The problem simplifies considerably if the electrostatic potential is separable along the transport and confinement directions, and further if the potential variations along the transport direction are slow enough to prevent dipolar coupling (Zener tunneling) between subbands.

The microscopic structure of the Si\/SiO2 interface roughness is directly treated by using a 3D finite element technique. The results show that (1) SRS reduces the electron density of states in the channel, which increases the SNWT threshold voltage, and (2) the SRS in SNWTs becomes less effective when fewer propagating modes are occupied, which implies that SRS is less important in small-diameter SNWTs with few modes conducting than in planar metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors with many transverse modes occupied.",
