            "We show that entanglement entropy of free fermions scales faster than area law, as opposed to the scaling L d\u2212 1 for the harmonic lattice, for example. We also suggest and provide evidence in support of an explicit formula for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in any dimension d, S\u223c c (\u2202 \u0393,\u2202 \u03a9) L d\u2212 1 log\ufeff L as the size of a subsystem L\u2192\u221e, where\u2202 \u0393 is the Fermi surface and\u2202 \u03a9 is the boundary of the region in real space. The expression for the constant c (\u2202 \u0393,\u2202 \u03a9) is based on a conjecture due to Widom. We prove that a similar expression holds for the particle number fluctuations and use it to prove a two sided estimate on the entropy S.",

It is shown that considerations based on the naive pairwise summation of van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces may not only give an incorrect estimate of the magnitude of the total Casimir force but even the wrong sign of the force when materials with high dielectric and magnetic responses are involved. Indeed repulsive Casimir forces may be found in a large range of parameters, and we suggest that the effect may be realized in known materials. The phenomenon of repulsive Casimir forces may be of importance both for experimental study and for nanomachinery applications.",

A universal relation is found between the generated entanglement entropy and the fluctuations of electric current, which is valid for any protocol of driving the QPC. This relation offers a basis for direct electric measurement of entanglement entropy. In particular, by utilizing space-time duality of 1D systems, we relate electric noise generated by opening and closing the QPC periodically in time with the seminal S= 1 3 log\ufeff L prediction of conformal field theory.",

We show that by using quantized pulses of simple form one can suppress the particle-hole pairs which are created by a generic excitation. The resulting many-body states are characterized by one or several particles excited above the Fermi surface accompanied by no disturbance below it. These excitations carry charge which is integer for noninteracting electron gas and fractional for Luttinger liquid. The operator algebra describing these excitations is derived, and a method of their detection which relies on noise measurement is proposed.",
