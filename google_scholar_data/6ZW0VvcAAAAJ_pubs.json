            "It has been known for more than 60 years, and suspected for over 100, that alveolar hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction by means of mechanisms local to the lung. For the last 20 years, it has been clear that the essential sensor, transduction, and effector mechanisms responsible for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) reside in the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell. The main focus of this review is the cellular and molecular work performed to clarify these intrinsic mechanisms and to determine how they are facilitated and inhibited by the extrinsic influences of other cells. Because the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms is likely to shape expression of HPV in vivo, we relate results obtained in cells to HPV in more intact preparations, such as intact and isolated lungs and isolated pulmonary vessels. Finally, we evaluate evidence regarding the contribution of HPV to the physiological and \u2026",

Most medical schools provide extensive computer networks for their students, and these are increasingly becoming a central component of the learning and teaching environment. Such advances bring new opportunities and challenges to medical education, and are having an impact on the way that we teach and on the way that students learn, and on the very design and delivery of the curriculum. The plethora of information available on the web is overwhelming, and both students and staff need to be taught how to manage it effectively.

Studies in animal models of chronic hypoxia have demonstrated the development of a persistent depolarization of pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In seeking to explain this effect, we compared under normoxic conditions the K+ currents in SMCs isolated from small PA of chronically hypoxic and normoxic rats. Chronic hypoxia was associated with a marked (40\u201350%) reduction in amplitude of a K+ current, which had the pharmacological and kinetic characteristics of a delayed rectifier. The resting potential of the isolated PA cells from chronically hypoxic animals was significantly more positive (-43.5 +\/- 2 mV) than that of cells from normoxic animals (-54.3 +\/- 2 mV), and this depolarization could be approximately mimicked in the cells from normoxic \u2026",

In mammals it allows optimal matching of the O2 requirements of the cells to ventilation and O2 delivery, underpins vital changes to the circulation during the transition from fetal to independent, air-breathing life, and provides a means by which dysfunction can be limited or prevented in disease. Certain tissues such as the carotid body, pulmonary circulation, neuroepithelial bodies and fetal adrenomedullary chromaffin cells are specialised for O2 sensing, though most others show for example alterations in transcription of specific genes during hypoxia. A number of mechanisms are known to respond to variations in PO2 over the physiological range, and have been proposed to fulfil the function as O2 sensors; these include modulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and a number of O2 \u2026",

HPV depends strongly on the degree of preconstriction, and we therefore examined the effect of Ca2+ channel blockade on tension and intracellular [Ca2+]([Ca2+] i) during HPV in rat intrapulmonary arteries (IPAs), whilst maintaining preconstriction constant. We also investigated the role of intracellular Ca2+ stores. 2 HPV demonstrated a transient constriction (phase I) superimposed on a sustained constriction (phase II). Nifedipine (1 \u03bcm) partially inhibited phase I, but did not affect phase II. In arteries exposed to 80 mm K+ and nifedipine or diltiazem the rises in tension and [Ca2+] i were blunted during phase I, but were unaffected during phase II. 3 At low concentrations (< 3 \u03bcm), La3+ almost abolished the phase I constriction and rise in [Ca2+] i, but had no \u2026",

Here we have used iontophoresis to deliver ATP to the forearm skin of volunteers who rated the magnitude of the evoked pain on a visual analogue scale. ATP consistently produced a modest burning pain, which began within 20 s of starting iontophoresis and was maintained for several minutes. Persistent iontophoresis of ATP led to desensitization within 12 min but recovery from this was almost complete 1 h later. Different doses of ATP were delivered using different iontophoretic driving currents. Iontophoresis of ATP produced a higher pain rating than saline, indicating that the pain was specifically caused by ATP. The average pain rating for ATP, but not saline, increased with increasing current. Using an 0.8 mA current \u2026",
