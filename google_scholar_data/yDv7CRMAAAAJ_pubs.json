            "We present evidence for a strong interaction between the conduction band and a narrow resonant band formed by nitrogen states in Ga 1\u2212 x In x N y As 1\u2212 y alloys. The interaction leads to a splitting of the conduction band into two subbands and a reduction of the fundamental band gap. An anticrossing of the extended states of the conduction band of the Ga 1\u2212 x In x As matrix and the localized nitrogen resonant states is used to model the interaction. Optical transitions associated with the energy minima of the two subbands and the characteristic anticrossing behavior of the transitions under applied hydrostatic pressure have been unambiguously observed using photomodulation spectroscopy. The experimental results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the model.",

            "As photovoltaic penetration of the power grid increases, accurate predictions of return on investment require accurate prediction of decreased power output over time. Degradation rates must be known in order to predict power delivery. This article reviews degradation rates of flat\u2010plate terrestrial modules and systems reported in published literature from field testing throughout the last 40\u2009years. Nearly 2000 degradation rates, measured on individual modules or entire systems, have been assembled from the literature, showing a median value of 0\u00b75%\/year. The review consists of three parts: a brief historical outline, an analytical summary of degradation rates, and a detailed bibliography partitioned by technology.

            "Absorbed sunlight in a solar cell produces electrons and holes. However, at the open-circuit condition, the carriers have no place to go. They build up in density, and ideally, they emit external luminescence that exactly balances the incoming sunlight. Any additional nonradiative recombination impairs the carrier density buildup, limiting the open-circuit voltage. At open circuit, efficient external luminescence is an indicator of low internal optical losses. Thus, efficient external luminescence is, counterintuitively, a necessity for approaching the Shockley\u2013Queisser (SQ) efficiency limit. A great solar cell also needs to be a great light-emitting diode. Owing to the narrow escape cone for light, efficient external emission requires repeated attempts and demands an internal luminescence efficiency 90%.",

Resistance to high-energy radiation damage is an essential feature of such cells as they power most satellites, including those used for communications, defense, and scientific research. Recently we have shown that the energy gap of In1\u2212xGaxN alloys potentially can be continuously varied from 0.7 to 3.4 eV, providing a full-solar-spectrum material system for multijunction solar cells. We find that the optical and electronic properties of these alloys exhibit a much higher resistance to high-energy (2 MeV) proton irradiation than the standard currently used photovoltaic materials such as GaAs and GaInP, and therefore offer great potential for radiation-hard high-efficiency solar cells for space applications.

            "We report on multijunction GaInP\/GaAs photovoltaic cells with efficiencies of 29.5% at 1\u2010sun concentration and air mass (AM) 1.5 global and 25.7% 1\u2010sun, AM0. These values represent the highest efficiencies achieved by any solar cell under these illumination conditions. Three key areas in this technology are identified and discussed; the grid design, front surface passivation of the top cell, and bottom surface passivation of both cells. Aspects of cell design related to its operation under concentration are also discussed.",
