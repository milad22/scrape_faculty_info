            "We report on a new analysis of neutrino oscillations in MINOS using the complete set of accelerator and atmospheric data. The analysis combines the \u03bd \u03bc disappearance and \u03bd e appearance data using the three-flavor formalism. We measure| \u0394 m 32 2|=[2.28\u20132.46]\u00d7 1 0\u2212 3 eV 2 (68% CL) and sin 2 \u03b8 23= 0.35\u20130.65 (90% CL) in the normal hierarchy, and| \u0394 m 32 2|=[2.32\u20132.53]\u00d7 1 0\u2212 3 eV 2 (68% CL) and sin 2 \u03b8 23= 0.34\u20130.67 (90% CL) in the inverted hierarchy. The data also constrain \u03b4 C P, the \u03b8 23 octant degeneracy and the mass hierarchy; we disfavor 36%(11%) of this three-parameter space at 68%(90%) CL",
