            "Following the invention of electron optics during the 1930s, lens aberrations have limited the achievable spatial resolution to about 50 times the wavelength of the imaging electrons 1. This situation is similar to that faced by Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth century, whose work to improve the quality of glass lenses led directly to his discovery of the ubiquitous \u201canimalcules\u201d in canal water, the first hints of the cellular basis of life. The electron optical aberration problem was well understood from the start, but more than 60 years elapsed before a practical correction scheme for electron microscopy was demonstrated 2, and even then the remaining chromatic aberrations still limited the resolution. We report here the implementation of a computer-controlled aberration correction system in a scanning transmission electron microscope 3, which is less sensitive to chromatic aberration. Using this approach, we achieve an \u2026",

A very sharp transition occurs about 7.6 eV above the Fermi energy in the p x, y results, agreeing closely with the nondispersive \u03c3* band. An additional feature near 8.5 eV above the Fermi energy may be due to the \u0393 2\u2212 branch of the free-electron-like interlayer states. With a modest excitonic distortion, the p z results agree closely with the expected \u03c0* band.",

            "Vibrational spectroscopies using infrared radiation 1, 2, Raman scattering 3, neutrons 4, low-energy electrons 5 and inelastic electron tunnelling 6 are powerful techniques that can analyse bonding arrangements, identify chemical compounds and probe many other important properties of materials. The spatial resolution of these spectroscopies is typically one micrometre or more, although it can reach a few tens of nanometres or even a few \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms when enhanced by the presence of a sharp metallic tip 6, 7. If vibrational spectroscopy could be combined with the spatial resolution and flexibility of the transmission electron microscope, it would open up the study of vibrational modes in many different types of nanostructures. Unfortunately, the energy resolution of electron energy loss spectroscopy performed in the electron microscope has until now been too poor to allow such a combination. Recent developments \u2026",

            "The excellent catalytic activity of metallic MoS 2 edges for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has led to substantial efforts towards increasing the edge concentration. The 2H basal plane is less active for the HER because it is less conducting and therefore possesses less efficient charge transfer kinetics. Here we show that the activity of the 2H basal planes of monolayer MoS 2 nanosheets can be made comparable to state-of-the-art catalytic properties of metallic edges and the 1T phase by improving the electrical coupling between the substrate and the catalyst so that electron injection from the electrode and transport to the catalyst active site is facilitated. Phase-engineered low-resistance contacts on monolayer 2H-phase MoS 2 basal plane lead to higher efficiency of charge injection in the nanosheets so that its intrinsic activity towards the HER can be measured. We demonstrate that onset potentials and \u2026",
