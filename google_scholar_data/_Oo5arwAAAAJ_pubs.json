            "The Double Chooz experiment presents an indication of reactor electron antineutrino disappearance consistent with neutrino oscillations. An observed-to-predicted ratio of events of 0.944\u00b10.016 (stat)\u00b10.040 (syst) was obtained in 101 days of running at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France, with two 4.25 GW th reactors. The results were obtained from a single 10 m 3 fiducial volume detector located 1050 m from the two reactor cores. The reactor antineutrino flux prediction used the Bugey4 flux measurement after correction for differences in core composition. The deficit can be interpreted as an indication of a nonzero value of the still unmeasured neutrino mixing parameter sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13. Analyzing both the rate of the prompt positrons and their energy spectrum, we find sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.086\u00b10.041 (stat)\u00b10.030 (syst), or, at 90% CL, 0.017< sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13< 0.16.",

This result features minimal model dependence and provides the most complete information on this process to date. With the assumption of CCQE scattering, the absolute cross section as a function of neutrino energy (\u03c3 [E \u03bd]) and the single differential cross section (d \u03c3 d Q 2) are extracted to facilitate comparison with previous measurements. These quantities may be used to characterize an effective axial-vector form factor of the nucleon and to improve the modeling of low-energy neutrino interactions on nuclear targets.

Several novel techniques have been developed to achieve significant reductions of the backgrounds and systematic uncertainties with respect to previous publications, whereas the efficiency of the signal has increased.

If interpreted in a two-neutrino oscillation model, \u03bd \u03bc\u2192 \u03bd e, the best oscillation fit to the excess has a probability of 21.1%, while the background-only fit has a \u03c7 2 probability of 6\u00d7 10\u2212 7 relative to the best fit.

We use a relativistic Fermi gas model for oxygen and assume the form factor is approximately a dipole with one parameter, the axial-vector mass M A, and fit to the shape of the distribution of the square of the momentum transfer from the nucleon to the nucleus. Our best fit result for M A= 1.20\u00b10.12 GeV. Furthermore, this analysis includes updated vector form factors from recent electron scattering experiments and a discussion of the effects of the nucleon momentum on the shape of the fitted distributions.",
