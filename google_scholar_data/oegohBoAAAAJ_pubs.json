It is found that if the large separation between branes arises from a small bulk scalar mass then the modulus (i.e. radion) is likely to be lighter than the lowest Kaluza-Klein excitations of bulk fields, and consequently may be the first direct signature of the model. Four-dimensional general covariance completely determines the couplings of the modulus to Standard Model fields. The strength of these couplings is determined by a single parameter which is set by the TeV rather than the Planck scale.",

The formalism is relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted by binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a clean separation of the three relevant scales: r s, the size of the compact objects, r, the orbital radius, and r\/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation (where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT, radiation is systematically included in the v expansion without the need to separate integrals into near zones and radiation zones. Using the EFT, we show that the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences which arise at v 6 in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations requires the presence of two nonminimal worldline \u2026",

There are two 3-branes, and the mass scale for fields that propagate on one of the 3-branes is exponentially suppressed relative to the fundamental scale of the theory, which is taken to be the Planck mass M Pl. In this Brief Report we show that bulk fields with a five dimensional mass term of order M Pl have, after integrating over the extra dimension, modes with four-dimensional masses that are exponentially suppressed as well. This opens the possibility that in this scenario the standard model matter fields may correspond to degrees of freedom that are not confined to a 3-brane.",

The Higgs interpretation of such a discovery is not the only possibility. For example, electroweak symmetry breaking could be triggered by a spontaneously broken, nearly conformal sector. The spectrum of states at the electroweak scale would then contain a narrow scalar resonance, the pseudo-Goldstone boson of conformal symmetry breaking, with Higgs-boson-like properties. If the conformal sector is strongly coupled, this pseudodilaton may be the only new state accessible at high energy colliders. We discuss the prospects for distinguishing this mode from a minimal Higgs boson at the LHC and ILC. The main discriminants between the two scenarios are (i) cubic self-interactions and (ii) a potential enhancement of couplings to massless SM gauge bosons.",

            "In this letter we show that, in five-dimensional anti-deSitter space (AdS) truncated by boundary branes, effective field theory techniques are reliable at high energy (much higher than the scale suggested by the Kaluza-Klein mass gap), provided one computes suitable observables. We argue that in the model of Randall and Sundrum for generating the weak scale from the AdS warp factor, the high energy behavior of gauge fields can be calculated in a {\\em cutoff independent manner}, provided one restricts Green's functions to external points on the Planck brane. Using the AdS\/CFT correspondence, we calculate the one-loop correction to the Planck brane gauge propagator due to charged bulk fields. These effects give rise to non-universal logarithmic energy dependence for a range of scales above the Kaluza-Klein gap.",
