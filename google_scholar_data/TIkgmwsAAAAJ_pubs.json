            "Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements on single crystals of the molecular magnets Fe 8 and Mn 12 reveal complex nonlinearities in the linewidths as functions of energy eigenstate, frequency, and temperature. Using a density-matrix equation with distributions of the uniaxial anisotropy parameter D, the Land\u00e9 g factor, and dipolar interactions, we obtain linewidths in good agreement with experiments. Our study shows that the distribution in D is common to the examined molecular magnets Fe 8 and Mn 12 regardless of the qualities of the samples. This could provide the basis for a proposed tunneling mechanism due to lattice defects. The distribution in g is also quite significant for Mn 12.",

Since the first experimental studies of TIs, angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) showed that the electronic structure of the topological surface states significantly changes as a function of time after cleavage. The origin and underlying mechanism of this ageing effect are still under debate, despite its importance. Here we investigate the evolution of the surface Dirac cone for Bi 2 Se 3 films upon asymmetric potassium (K) adsorption, using density-functional theory and a tight-binding model. We find that the K adatoms induce short-ranged downward band bending within 2\u20133 nm from the surface, due to charge transfer from the adatoms to the TI.
