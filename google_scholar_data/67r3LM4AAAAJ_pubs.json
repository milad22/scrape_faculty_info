This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers. All of these components come together under the ATLAS simulation infrastructure. In this paper, that infrastructure is discussed, including that supporting the detector description, interfacing the event generation, and combining the GEANT4 simulation of the response of the individual detectors.

The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these methods are monitored as a function of time and of \u03bc, the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and \u03bc-dependence between the methods is less than 2% for 0<\u03bc<2.5. Absolute luminosity calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic uncertainty of \u00b111%, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents.

            "A measurement of the production cross-section for top quark pairs () in pp collisions at  is presented using data recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Events are selected in two different topologies: single lepton (electron e or muon \u03bc) with large missing transverse energy and at least four jets, and dilepton (ee, \u03bc\u03bc or e\u03bc) with large missing transverse energy and at least two jets. In a data sample of 2.9 pb\u22121, 37 candidate events are observed in the single-lepton topology and 9 events in the dilepton topology. The corresponding expected backgrounds from non- Standard Model processes are estimated using data-driven methods and determined to be 12.2\u00b13.9 events and 2.5\u00b10.6 events, respectively. The kinematic properties of the selected events are consistent with SM  production. The inclusive top quark pair production cross-section is measured to be \u2026",
