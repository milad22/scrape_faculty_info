The main diagnostic is gas puff imaging, in which the visible D\u03b1 emission from a localized D2 gas puff is viewed along a local magnetic field line. The observed D\u03b1 fluctuations have a typical radial and poloidal scale of \u22481 cm, and often have strong local maxima (\u201cblobs\u201d) in the scrape-off layer. The motion of this 2D structure motion has also been measured using an ultrafast framing camera with 12 frames taken at 250\u200a000 frames\/s.

During the last decades, increasing availability of satellite and ground-based measurements has made it possible to study these phenomena in more detail. Numerous publications have documented the existence of persistent asymmetries in processes, properties and topology of plasma structures in various regions of geospace. In this paper, we present a review of our present knowledge of some of the most pronounced dawn\u2013dusk asymmetries. We focus on four key aspects: (1) the role of external influences such as the solar wind and its interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere; (2) properties of the magnetosphere itself; (3) the role of the ionosphere and (4) feedback and coupling between regions. We have also identified potential inconsistencies and gaps in our understanding of dawn\u2013dusk asymmetries in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.",

            "Neutral atoms play important roles in non-fully-ionized plasmas. In helicon sources, neutral pumping and neutral damping of waves are poorly understood. Measurement of the spatial distribution of neutral atoms is possible with spectroscopic diagnostics such as laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and passive emission spectroscopy. However, these measurements typically apply to an excited neutral atom state, rather than the entire neutral population. With a collisional-radiative (CR) model employing Langmuir probe measured electron parameters in argon helicon source plasmas, we have reproduced LIF and emission spectroscopy measured radial profiles for three excited neutral states. The CR model indicates a neutral depletion on axis of at least 60%. Simple calculations based on measured edge neutral pressures and peak plasma densities significantly underestimate the degree of ionization in the core of the \u2026",
