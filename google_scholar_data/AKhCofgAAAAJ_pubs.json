Multi-atom clusters have been found to exhibit physical properties beyond those available from the standard elements in the periodic table; classification of the properties of such clusters effectively enables expansion of the periodic table to a third dimension. Using clusters as superatomic building blocks for hierarchically assembled materials allows these properties to be incorporated into designer materials with tailored properties. Cluster-assembled materials are currently being explored and methods developed to control their design and function. Here, we discuss examples of building block syntheses, assembly strategies, and property control achieved to date.",

            "Electronic structure calculations on the nature of electronic states and the magnetic coupling in Mn-acetate [Mn 12 O 12 (R COO) 16 (H 2 O) 4] molecules have been been carried out within the generalized gradient approximation to the density functional formalism. Our studies on this 100-atom molecule illustrate the role of the nonmagnetic carboxyl host in stabilizing the ferrimagnetic Mn 12 O 12 core and provide estimates of the local magnetic moment at the various sites. We provide a first density-functional-based prediction of the second-order magnetic anisotropy energy of this system. Results are in excellent agreement with experiment. To perform these calculations we introduce a simplified exact method for spin-orbit coupling and magnetic anisotropy energies in multicenter systems. This method is free of shape approximations and has other advantages as well. First, it is valid for periodic boundary conditions \u2026",

            "Recent innovations in experimental techniques such as molecular and cluster beam epitaxy, supersonic jet expansion, matrix isolation and chemical synthesis are increasingly enabling researchers to produce materials by design and with atomic dimension. These materials constrained by sire, shape, and symmetry range from clusters containing as few as two atoms to nanoscale materials consisting of thousands of atoms. They possess unique structuraI, electronic, magnetic and optical properties that depend strongly on their size and geometry. The availability of these materials raises many fundamental questions as weIl as technological possibilities. From the academic viewpoint, the most pertinent question concerns the evolution of the atomic and electronic structure of the system as it grows from micro clusters to crystals. At what stage, for example, does the cluster look as if it is a fragment of the corresponding crystal. How do electrons forming bonds in micro-clusters transform to bands in solids? How do the size dependent properties change from discrete quantum conditions, as in clusters, to boundary constrained bulk conditions, as in nanoscale materials, to bulk conditions insensitive to boundaries? How do the criteria of classification have to be changed as one goes from one size domain to another? Potential for high technological applications also seem to be endless. Clusters of otherwise non-magnetic materials exhibit magnetic behavior when constrained by size, shape, and dimension. NanoscaIe metal particles exhibit non-linear opticaI properties and increased mechanical strength. SimiIarly, materials made from nanoscale ceramic \u2026",
