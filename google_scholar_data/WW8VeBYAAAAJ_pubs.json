The results of the calculations reproduce isospin diffusion data from two different observables and the ratios of neutron and proton spectra. By comparing these data to calculations performed over a range of symmetry energies at saturation density and different representations of the density dependence of the symmetry energy, constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy at subnormal density are obtained. The results from the present work are compared to constraints put forward in other recent analyses.",

Free nucleon transverse emission ratios are compared to those of A= 3 mirror nuclei. Comparisons are made to Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport calculations and conclusions concerning the density dependence of the asymmetry term of the nuclear equation of state at subnuclear densities are made. Comparison to BUU model predictions indicate a density dependence of the asymmetry energy that is closer to a form in which the asymmetry energy increases as the square root of the density for the density region studied. A coalescent-invariant analysis is introduced as a means of reducing suggested difficulties with cluster emission in total nucleon emission.",

The calculated neutron\u2013proton spectral double ratios for these two systems are sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy, consistent with previous work. Cluster emission increases the double ratios in the low energy region relative to values calculated in a coalescence-invariant approach. To circumvent uncertainties in cluster production and secondary decays, it is important to have more accurate measurements of the neutron\u2013proton ratios at higher energies in the center of mass system, where the influence of such effects is reduced.",

            "Spectroscopic factors have been extracted for proton-rich Ar 34 and neutron-rich Ar 46 using the (p, d) neutron transfer reaction. The experimental results show little reduction of the ground state neutron spectroscopic factor of the proton-rich nucleus Ar 34 compared to that of Ar 46. The results suggest that correlations, which generally reduce such spectroscopic factors, do not depend strongly on the neutron-proton asymmetry of the nucleus in this isotopic region as was reported in knockout reactions. The present results are consistent with results from systematic studies of transfer reactions but inconsistent with the trends observed in knockout reaction measurements.",
