            "Leading experts explore the exotic properties and exciting applications of electromagnetic metamaterials Metamaterials: Physics and Engineering Explorations gives readers a clearly written, richly illustrated introduction to the most recent research developments in the area of electromagnetic metamaterials. It explores the fundamental physics, the designs, and the engineering aspects, and points to a myriad of exciting potential applications. The editors, acknowledged leaders in the field of metamaterials, have invited a group of leading researchers to present both their own findings and the full array of state-of-the-art applications for antennas, waveguides, devices, and components. Following a brief overview of the history of artificial materials, the publication divides its coverage into two major classes of metamaterials. The first half of the publication examines effective media with single (SNG) and double negative (DNG) properties; the second half examines electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures. The book further divides each of these classes into their three-dimensional (3D volumetric) and two-dimensional (2D planar or surface) realizations. Examples of each type of metamaterial are presented, and their known and anticipated properties are reviewed. Collectively, Metamaterials: Physics and Engineering Explorations presents a review of recent research advances associated with a highly diverse set of electromagnetic metamaterials. Its multifaceted approach offers readers a combination of theoretical, numerical, and experimental perspectives for a better understanding of their behaviors and their potentialapplications in components \u2026",

We report a theoretical study showing that by designing and manipulating spatially inhomogeneous, nonuniform conductivity patterns across a flake of graphene, one can have this material as a one-atom-thick platform for infrared metamaterials and transformation optical devices. Varying the graphene chemical potential by using static electric field yields a way to tune the graphene conductivity in the terahertz and infrared frequencies. Such degree of freedom provides the prospect of having different \u201cpatches\u201d with different conductivities on a single flake of graphene. Numerous photonic functions and metamaterial concepts can be expected to follow from such a platform.",

            "We report an improved synthesis of colloidal gold nanorods (NRs) by using aromatic additives that reduce the concentration of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant to \u223c0.05 M as opposed to 0.1 M in well-established protocols. The method optimizes the synthesis for each of the 11 additives studied, allowing a rich array of monodisperse gold NRs with longitudinal surface plasmon resonance tunable from 627 to 1246 nm to be generated. The gold NRs form large-area ordered assemblies upon slow evaporation of NR solution, exhibiting liquid crystalline ordering and several distinct local packing motifs that are dependent upon the NR\u2019s aspect ratio. Tailored synthesis of gold NRs with simultaneous improvements in monodispersity and dimensional tunability through rational introduction of additives will not only help to better understand the mechanism of seed-mediated growth of gold NRs but also \u2026",
