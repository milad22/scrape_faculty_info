            "Applying Dickey\u2010Fuller time series techniques in tandem with intuitive plot\u2010displays, we examine recent trends in girls' violence and the gender gap as reported in four major sources of longitudinal data on youth violence. These sources are arrest statistics of the Uniform Crime Reports, victimization data of the National Crime Victimization Survey (where the victim identifies sex of offender) and self\u2010reported violent behavior of Monitoring the Future and National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. We find that the rise in girls' violence over the past one to two decades as counted in police arrest data from the Uniform Crime Reports is not borne out in unofficial longitudinal sources. Several net\u2010widening policy shifts have apparently escalated girls' arrest\u2010proneness: first, stretching definitions of violence to include more minor incidents that girls in relative terms are more likely to commit; second, increased policing of violence \u2026",

Understanding overtraining syndrome (OTS) is helpful in the evaluation, management, and education of athletes.Evidence Acquisition: Relevant articles in English were searched with OVID (1948-2011) and PubMed using the following keywords: overtraining syndrome, overtraining, overreaching, unexplained underperformance, staleness, pathophysiology, management, treatment, evaluation. Bibliographies were reviewed for additional resources.Results: OTS appears to be a maladapted response to excessive exercise without adequate rest, resulting in perturbations of multiple body systems (neurologic, endocrinologic, immunologic) coupled with mood changes. Many hypotheses of OTS pathogenesis are reviewed, and a clinical approach to athletes with possible OTS (including history, testing, and prevention) is presented.Conclusions: OTS \u2026",

Lacking centralized information, we developed a rich database covering 83 corporate frauds involving 436 defendants. We extracted information from indictments and secondary sources on corporate conspiracy networks (e.g., co-conspirator roles, company positions, and distribution of profit). Findings support the gendered paradigm. Typically, women were not part of conspiracy groups. When women were involved, they had more minor roles and made less profit than their male co-conspirators.

            "Constructionist theories suggest the national rise in female violence arrests may be policy generated because arrest statistics are produced by violent behavior and changing official responses (e.g., net-widening enforcement policies). Normative theories attribute the rise to female behavior changes (e.g., in response to increased freedoms or hardships). We examine whether any narrowing of the arrest gender gap is borne out across offense types of varying measurement reliability, in victimization data, and across two post-arrest criminal justice stages. Advanced time-series analyses over 1980 through 2003 support the constructionist position. First, all sources show little or no increase in women's rates for the more reliably measured offenses of homicide and robbery, and for rape. Second, the assault gender gap narrows for arrests, but holds stable in victimization data. And, third, the assault gender gap \u2026",

            "In this chapter, the authors review the nature of female offending and advance a paradigm that builds on existing theory and work on gender. The authors begin by presenting an overview of pat-terns of female offending and the\" gender gap\" and contend that nowhere is the gender ratio more skewed than in the great disparity of males as offend ers and females as victims of sexual and domestic abuse. The authors introduce a gendered paradigm for explaining female crime first sketched elsewhere and explain how gendered theory is differ-ent from gender-specific theories. The gendered paradigm is then used to illu-minate more specifically the nature and context of female offending.On one hand, the authors adopt the position that in spite of their androcentric origins, traditional structural and so-cial process theories (even though they are based on studies of men) are rela-tively gender neutral and help explain female and male crime at a general level. On the other hand, the authors contend that many of the subtle and profound differences between female and male offending patterns may be better understood by a gendered approach that takes into account the continued profound differences between the lives of women and men that shape the different patterns of offending. The authors highlight the fact that rather than equality between the sexes",

There is evidence of robust, multidimensional family structure effects across constructs reflecting the presence of two\u2010parent families: mother\/father absence, shortages of employed men, and nonmarital\/teen childbearing. Findings indicate mainly gender similarity in family structural sources of homicide, but subtle gender differences include stronger effects on male homicide patterns and female\u2010specific mediating effects of the care burden on homicide. Further exploration of diverse family constructs is warranted, but, methodologically, father absence is adequate as a control for family structure.
