            "The unusual properties of two-dimensional electron systems that give rise to the quantum Hall effect have prompted the development of new microscopic models for electrical conduction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The bulk properties of the quantum Hall effect have also been studied experimentally using a variety of probes including transport 7, 8, photoluminescence 9, 10, magnetization 11 and capacitance 12, 13 measurements. However, the fact that two-dimensional electron systems typically exist some distance (about 1,000 \u00c5) beneath the surface of the host semiconductor has presented an important obstacle to more direct measurements of microscopic electronic structure in the quantum Hall regime. Here we introduce a cryogenic scanning-probe technique\u2014\u2018subsurface charge accumulation\u2019imaging\u2014that permits very high resolution examination of systems of mobile electrons inside materials.

Local atomic distortions in the Te nets due to the CDW are larger than observed crystallographically, resulting in distinct short and long Te-Te bonds. Observation of different distortion amplitudes in the local and average structures is explained by the discommensurated nature of the CDW, since the pair distribution function is sensitive to the local displacements within the commensurate regions, whereas the crystallographic result averages over many discommensurated domains. The result is supported by STM data. This is the first quantitative local structural study within the commensurate domains in an IC-CDW system.",
