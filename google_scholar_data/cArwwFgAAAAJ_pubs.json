We sought to determine whether patients with unipolar major depression have diminished SERT availability as assessed by both brainstem [123I]\u03b2-CIT SPECT and platelet [3H]paroxetine binding.Methods: Drug-free depressed and healthy subjects were injected with 211 \u00b1 22 MBq [123I]\u03b2-CIT and imaged 24 \u00b1 2 h later under equilibrium conditions. A ratio of specific to nonspecific brain uptake (V3\u2033 = (brainstem-occipital)\/occipital), a measure proportional to the binding potential (Bmax\/Kd), was used for all comparisons.Results: Results showed a statistically significant reduction in brainstem V3\u2033 values in depressed as compared to healthy subjects (3.1 \u00b1 .9 vs. 3.8 \u00b1 .8, p = .02).

            "Background A history of early adverse experiences is an important risk factor for adult psychopathology. Changes in stress sensitivity and functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may underlie the association between stress and risk for psychiatric disorders. Preclinical work in rodents has linked low levels of maternal care to increased methylation of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, as well as to exaggerated hormonal and behavioral responses to stress. Recent studies have begun to examine whether early-life stress leads to epigenetic modifications of the GR gene in humans.   Methods We examined the degree of methylation of a region of the promoter of the human GR gene (NR3C1) in leukocyte DNA from 99 healthy adults. Participants reported on their childhood experiences of parental behavior, parental death or desertion, and childhood maltreatment. On a separate day, participants completed the dexamethasone\/corticotropin-releasing hormone (Dex\/CRH) test, a standardized neuroendocrine challenge test.   Results Disruption or lack of adequate nurturing, as measured by parental loss, childhood maltreatment, and parental care, was associated with increased NR3C1 promoter methylation (p<.05). In addition, NR3C1 promoter methylation was linked to attenuated cortisol responses to the Dex\/CRH test (p<.05).   Conclusions These findings suggest that childhood maltreatment or adversity may lead to epigenetic modifications of the human GR gene. Alterations in methylation of this gene could underlie the associations between childhood adversity, alterations in stress reactivity, and risk for \u2026",

Recent research has pointed to early-life stress, particularly childhood maltreatment, as an independent and preventable risk factor for systemic inflammation in adulthood. Some data suggest that adults with a history of childhood maltreatment exhibit a heightened inflammatory response to acute stress challenge. To further elucidate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, we examined plasma IL-6 response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in 69 healthy adult subjects without depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.

Participants (32 women, 30 men) completed a standardized psychosocial stress challenge (i.e., the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)), during which several physiological (e.g., cortisol reactivity, heart rate) and psychological (e.g., depression, irritability, anger, fear) measures were assessed.
