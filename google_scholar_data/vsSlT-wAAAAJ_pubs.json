            "Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157\u2013165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.00049.001",

The GSs obtained by hydrogen arc discharge exfoliation exhibit a high electrical conductivity of \u223c2 \u00d7 103 S\/cm and high thermal stability with oxidization resistance temperature of 601 \u00b0C, which are much better than those prepared by argon arc discharge exfoliation (\u223c2 \u00d7 102 S\/cm, 525 \u00b0C) and by conventional thermal exfoliation (\u223c80 S\/cm, 507 \u00b0C) with the same starting GO.

Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton 2, 3, 4.

We found that Dnmt3a expression was regulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic cocaine use and chronic social defeat stress. Moreover, NAc-specific manipulations that block DNA methylation potentiated cocaine reward and exerted antidepressant-like effects, whereas NAc-specific Dnmt3a overexpression attenuated cocaine reward and was pro-depressant. On a cellular level, we found that chronic cocaine use selectively increased thin dendritic spines on NAc neurons and that DNA methylation was both necessary and sufficient to mediate these effects.

            "In IR and Raman spectral studies, the congestion of the vibrational modes in the C\u2212H stretching region between 2800 and 3000 cm-1 has complicated spectral assignment, conformational analysis, and structural and dynamics studies, even with quite a few of the simplest molecules. To resolve these issues, polarized spectra measurement on a well aligned sample is generally required. Because the liquid interface is generally ordered and molecularly thin, and sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) is an intrinsically coherent polarization spectroscopy, SFG-VS can be used for discerning details in vibrational spectra of the interfacial molecules. Here we show that, from systematic molecular symmetry and SFG-VS polarization analysis, a set of polarization selection rules could be developed for explicit assignment of the SFG vibrational spectra of the C\u2212H stretching modes. These polarization \u2026",
