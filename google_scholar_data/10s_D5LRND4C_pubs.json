            "Neutron powder diffraction has been used to characterize a sample of C-substituted MgB2 synthesized from Mg and B4C (with isotopically enriched 11B). The sample is multiphase, with the major phase [73.4(1) wt%] being Mg(B1\u2212xCx)2 with x=0.10(2). Minor phases include MgB2C2, Mg, and MgO. The major Mg(B1\u2212xCx)2 phase displays diffraction peak widths as sharp as for pure MgB2, indicating good C homogeneity. There is no evidence for ordering of the substituted C atoms or distortion of the host structure other than contraction of the a axis and slight expansion of the c axis. The observed changes in lattice parameters vs. C concentration provide a means for estimating the C concentration in other Mg(B1\u2212xCx)2 samples. The reduction in Tc resulting from 10% C substitution is much larger than previously reported, suggesting that previous reports of the C concentration in Mg(B1\u2212xCx)2 are overestimated.

            "Strong friction anisotropy is found when the twofold surface of an atomically clean aluminum-nickel-cobalt quasicrystal slides against a thiol-passivated titanium-nitride tip. Friction along the aperiodic direction is one-eighth as much as that along the periodic direction. This anisotropy, which is about three times as large as the highest value observed in anisotropic crystalline surfaces, disappears after the surface is oxidized in air. These results reveal a strong connection between interface atomic structure and the mechanisms by which energy is dissipated, which likely include electronic or phononic contributions, or both.",

To obtain high values of RRR, high purity reagents are necessary. With the isotopically pure boron we obtained the highest RRR\u223c 20 for the stoichiometric compound. We also investigated Mg x 11 B 2 samples with 0.8< x< 1.2. For the range Mg 0.8 11 B 2 up to Mg 1.2 11 B 2 we found average values of RRR between 14 and 24. For smaller variations in stoichiometry (x= 1\u00b10.1) RRR= 18\u00b13. All of our data point to the conclusion that high RRR (\u223c 20) and low \u03c1 0 (\u2a7d 0.4 \u03bc\u03a9 cm) are intrinsic material properties associated with high purity MgB 2.

Despite the strong suppression of the transition temperature by 17 K in comparison with the pure MgB 2, the same reduced value of the small superconducting energy gap with 2 \u0394\/k T c\u2248 1.7 has been systematically observed. This indicates that the two-band\/two-gap superconductivity is still preserved here.",
