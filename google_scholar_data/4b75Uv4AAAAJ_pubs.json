The scale invariance of the AdS 2 region implies that at low energies the dual field theory exhibits emergent quantum critical behavior controlled by a (0+ 1)-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). This interpretation sheds light on recently-discovered holographic descriptions of Fermi surfaces, allowing an analytic understanding of their low-energy excitations. For example, the scaling behavior near the Fermi surfaces is determined by conformal dimensions in the emergent IR CFT. In particular, when the operator is marginal in the IR CFT, the corresponding spectral function is precisely of the \u201cmarginal Fermi liquid\u201d form, postulated to describe the optimally doped cuprates.",

For theories with entanglement entropy computed by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula S=\/(4G N), we obtain the linearized Einstein equations.

Starting with field theories defined on a cut-off surface in a bulk spacetime, we propose that integrating out high energy modes in the field theory should correspond to integrating out a part of the bulk geometry. We describe how to carry out this procedure in practice in the classical gravity approximation using examples of scalar and vector fields. By integrating out bulk degrees of freedom all the way to a black hole horizon, this formulation defines a refined version of the black hole membrane paradigm. Furthermore, it also provides a derivation of the semi-holographic description of low energy physics.",

Using the replica trick the EREs can be related to a partition function of n copies of the CFT glued together in a particular way along the intervals. In the case of two intervals this procedure defines a genus n-1 surface and our goal is to find smooth three dimensional gravitational solutions with this surface living at the boundary. We find two families of handlebody solutions labelled by the replica index n. These particular bulk solutions are distinguished by the fact that they do not spontaneously break the replica symmetries of the boundary surface. We show that the regularized classical action of these solutions is given in terms of a simple numerical prescription. If we assume that they give the dominant contribution to the gravity partition function we can relate this classical action to the EREs at leading order in G_N. We argue that the prescription can be formulated for non-integer n. Upon taking the limit n-> 1 the classical action reproduces the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy.",

We use this fact along with monotonicity of relative entropy to prove the averaged null energy condition in Minkowski space-time. This subsequently gives a new proof of the Hofman-Maldacena bounds on the parameters appearing in CFT three-point functions.
