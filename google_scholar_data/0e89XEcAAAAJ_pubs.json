Phenomena similar to wave and soliton propagation, hydraulic jump, and others should take place in this electron fluid. We show that a relatively slow electron flow should be unstable because of plasma wave amplification due to the reflection from the device boundaries. This provides a new mechanism for the generation of tunable far infrared electromagnetic radiation.",

This response can be used for new types of detectors, mixers, and multipliers. These devices should operate at much higher frequencies than conventional, transit-time limited devices, since the plasma waves propagate much faster than electrons. The responsivities of such devices may greatly exceed the responsivities of Schottky diodes currently used as detectors and mixers in the terahertz range. A long channel HEMT has a nonresonant response to electromagnetic radiation and can be used as a broadband detector for frequencies up to several tens of terahertz.",
