            "We present nuclear reaction network calculations to investigate the influence of nuclear structure on the rp-process between Ge and Sn in various scenarios. Due to the lack of experimental data for neutron-deficient nuclei in this region, we discuss currently available model predictions for nuclear masses and deformations as well as methods of calculating reaction rates (Hauser-Feshbach) and \u03b2-decay rates (QRPA and shell model). In addition, we apply a valence nucleon (NpNn) correlation scheme for the prediction of masses and deformations. We also describe the calculations of 2p-capture reactions, which had not been considered before in this mass region. We find that in X-ray bursts 2p-capture reactions accelerate the reaction flow into the Z \u2265 36 region considerably. Therefore, the rp-process in most X-ray bursts does not end in the Z = 32\u201336 region as previously assumed and overproduction factors of 107 \u2026",

In both steady-state nuclear burning appropriate for rapidly accreting neutron stars (such as the magnetic polar caps of accreting x-ray pulsars) and unstable burning of type I x-ray bursts, we find that the rp process ends in a closed SnSbTe cycle. This prevents the synthesis of elements heavier than Te and has important consequences for x-ray burst profiles, the composition of accreting neutron stars, and potentially galactic nucleosynthesis of light p nuclei.",

This multifaceted problem remains one of the greatest open challenges in all of physics. Knowledge of nuclear physics properties such as masses, \u03b2-decay and neutron capture rates, as well as \u03b2-delayed neutron emission probabilities are critical inputs that go into calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis. While properties of nuclei near stability have been established, much still remains unknown regarding neutron-rich nuclei far from stability that may participate in the r process. Sensitivity studies gauge the astrophysical response of a change in nuclear physics input (s) which allows for the isolation of the most important nuclear properties that shape the final abundances observed in nature.

In the 1950s Hoyle proposed the existence of the state in order to account for the stellar abundance of carbon. Aside from its key role in the synthesis of the elements it is believed to possess a rather unusual structure, where the dominant degrees of freedom are those of \u03b1-particle clusters rather than nucleons. An understanding of the properties of the Hoyle state, for example its radius and excitations, has been the focus of a major experimental activity. Similarly, unravelling precisely why a cluster state should arise at precisely the right energy to promote synthesis of carbon has been a central theoretical challenge. To a significant extent, the Hoyle-state has become a cornerstone for state-of-the-art nuclear theory. This review examines the present status of both theory and experiment and indicates directions \u2026",

Excited states in C 12 were reconstructed filtered by the condition that the \u03b1-decay proceeded via the Be 8 ground state. In both measurements, evidence was found for a new state at 13.3 (0.2) MeV with a width 1.7 (0.2) MeV. Angular correlation measurements from the C 12 (He 4, He 4+ He 4+ He 4) He 4 reaction indicates that the state may have J \u03c0= 4+.",
