The potential for process-induced solid phase transformations must be evaluated during design and development of formulations and manufacturing processes. This article briefly reviews the basic principles of polymorphism, defines the classes of phase transformation and the underlying transformation mechanisms, and discusses respective kinetic factors. The potential phase transformations associated with common unit operations employed in manufacturing solid oral dosage forms are highlighted. Specific examples are given to illustrate the importance of solid phases, and process-induced phase transitions in formulation and process development.",

An amorphous drug can be stabilized by dispersing it in a polymer matrix. To implement this approach, it is desirable to know the drug\u2019s solubility in the chosen polymer, which defines the maximal drug loading without risk of crystallization. Measuring the solubility of a crystalline drug in a polymer is difficult because the high viscosity of polymers makes achieving solubility equilibrium difficult. Method Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to detect dissolution endpoints of solute\/polymer mixtures prepared by cryomilling.
