            "Free magnetic moments usually manifest themselves in Curie laws, where weak external magnetic fields produce magnetizations that vary as the reciprocal of the temperature (1\/T). For a variety of materials that do not display static magnetism, including doped semiconductors 1 and certain rare-earth intermetallics 2, the 1\/T law is replaced by a power law T-\u03b1 with \u03b1< 1. Here we show that a much simpler material system\u2014namely, the insulating magnetic salt LiHo x Y 1-x F 4\u2014can also display such a power law. Moreover, by comparing the results of numerical simulations of this system with susceptibility and specific-heat data 3, we show that both energy-level splitting and quantum entanglement are crucial to describing its behaviour. The second of these quantum mechanical effects\u2014entanglement, where the wavefunction of a system with several degrees of freedom cannot be written as a product of wavefunctions \u2026",

From comparative measurements of samples with Rhodamine B and CdSe\/ZnS QDs it is established that PbS LSCs generate nearly twice the photocurrent in silicon cells than the other materials, achieving an integrated optical efficiency of 12.6%. This is attributed primarily to the broadband absorption of PbS which allows optimum harvesting of the solar spectrum.",

One particularly simple system is a ferromagnet approaching its Curie temperature, T C, where all of the spins associated with partially filled atomic shells acquire parallel orientation. With the addition of disorder by way of chemical substitution, the Curie point is suppressed, but no qualitatively new phenomena appear in bulk measurements as long as the disorder is truly random on the atomic scale and not so large as to eliminate ferromagnetism entirely 1. Here we report the discovery that a simply measured magnetic response is singular above the Curie temperature of a model, disordered magnet, and that the associated singularity grows to an anomalous divergence at T C.

Through the luminescence of the QDs we are able to track the movement of the nanoparticles as the phase is formed as well as spectrally probe the resulting QD assemblies. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, combined with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data reveal that the QD assemblies have a consistent inter-particle spacing of approximately 7.6 nm.
