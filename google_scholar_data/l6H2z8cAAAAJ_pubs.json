First, we employ Raman spectroscopy to observe phonon softening with increased strain, breaking the degeneracy in the E\u2032 Raman mode of MoS2, and extract a Gru\u0308neisen parameter of \u223c1.06. Second, using photoluminescence spectroscopy we measure a decrease in the optical band gap of MoS2 that is approximately linear with strain, \u223c45 meV\/% strain for monolayer MoS2 and \u223c120 meV\/% strain for bilayer MoS2. Third, we observe a pronounced strain-induced decrease in the photoluminescence intensity of monolayer MoS2 that is indicative of the direct-to-indirect transition of the character of the optical band gap of this material at applied strain of \u223c1%. These observations constitute a demonstration \u2026",

A coherent wave packet motion of VV dimers at 6 THz modulates the lattice polarizability for approximately 1 ps. In contrast, the electronic conductivity settles to a constant value already after one VV oscillation cycle.

Thermal annealing results in grain growth and improved crystallinity. Normally, larger crystallites show smaller hysteresis, as there is a greater probability of finding a nucleating defect in the larger volume. But at the same time, this improved crystal perfection, which accompanies the thermal annealing and grain growth, tends to a larger hysteresis, as there are fewer nucleating defects within the volume. We show that the width and shape of the hysteresis cycle are thus determined by the competing effects of crystallinity and grain size.",

Vanadium dioxide (VO 2) belongs to this family of'smart materials' because it exhibits a semiconductor-to-metal first-order phase transition near 340 K, accompanied by an abrupt change in its resistivity and near-infrared transmission. It is also of great interest in condensed-matter physics because it is a classic strongly correlated electron system. In order to integrate vanadium dioxide into microelectronic circuits, thin-film growth of VO 2 has been studied extensively, and studies of VO 2 nanoparticles have shown that the phase transition is size-dependent. This paper presents a broad overview of the growth techniques that have been used to produce thin films and nanoparticles of VO 2, including chemical vapor deposition, sol\u2013gel \u2026",

We compare our experimental data with models proposed for the evolution of the phase transition. The experimental data show that the phase transition occurs via the gradual growth of metallic domains in the film, and that the dielectric properties of the film in the vicinity of the transition temperature must be described by effective-medium theory. The simultaneous measurement of both transmission and phase shift allows us to show that Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium theory, coupled with the Drude conductivity model, can account for the observed behavior, whereas the widely used \u2026",

            "The size effects on the optical properties of vanadium dioxide nanoparticles in ordered arrays have been studied. Contrary to previous V O 2 studies, we observe that the optical contrast between the semiconducting and metallic phases is dramatically enhanced in the visible region, presenting size-dependent optical resonances and size-dependent transition temperatures. The collective optical response as a function of temperature presents an enhanced scattering state during the evolving phase transition. The effects appear to arise because of the underlying V O 2 mesoscale optical properties, the heterogeneous nucleation behind the phase transition, and the incoherent coupling between the nanoparticles undergoing an order-disorder-order transition. Calculations that support these interpretations are presented.",
