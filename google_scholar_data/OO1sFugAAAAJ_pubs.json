            "Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector of malaria, a disease that afflicts more than 500 million people and causes more than 1 million deaths each year. Tenfold shotgun sequence coverage was obtained from the PEST strain of A. gambiae and assembled into scaffolds that span 278 million base pairs. A total of 91% of the genome was organized in 303 scaffolds; the largest scaffold was 23.1 million base pairs. There was substantial genetic variation within this strain, and the apparent existence of two haplotypes of approximately equal frequency (\u201cdual haplotypes\u201d) in a substantial fraction of the genome likely reflects the outbred nature of the PEST strain. The sequence produced a conservative inference of more than 400,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed a markedly bimodal density distribution. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed strong evidence for about 14,000 protein-encoding \u2026",

            "To investigate the prevalence and behavior of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) associated  with a first-ever stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), we prospectively studied 161 consecutive  patients admitted to our stroke unit. Complete neurological assessment was performed to determine  parenchymatous and vascular localization of the neurological lesion. Stroke subtype was categorized  as TIA, ischemic (IS), or hemorrhagic (HS). A portable respiratory recording (PRR) study was performed within 48\u201372 h after admission (acute phase), and subsequently after 3 mo (stable phase).  During the acute phase, 116 patients (71.4%) had an apnea\u2013hypopnea index (AHI)  >  10 events\/h and  45 (28%) had an AHI  >  30. No relationships were found between sleep-related respiratory events  and the topographical parenchymatous location of the neurological lesion or vascular involvement.  Cheyne\u2013Stokes \u2026",
