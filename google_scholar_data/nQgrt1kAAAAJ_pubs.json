            "A search for neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) decaying to tau-lepton pairs in pp collisions is performed, using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 24.6 fb\u2212 1, with 4.9 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 19.7 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes the case where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a b-quark jet. No excess is observed in the tau-lepton-pair invariant mass spectrum. Exclusion limits are presented in the MSSM parameter space for different benchmark scenarios, m h max, m h mod+, m h mod\u2212, light-stop, light-stau, \u03c4-phobic, and low-m H. Upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction for gluon fusion and b-quark associated Higgs boson production are also given.",

The search is sensitive to both the standard model Higgs boson and to the neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM).

For a standard model Higgs boson in the mass range of 110\u2013145 GeV upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the production cross section are determined. We exclude a Higgs boson with m H= 115 GeV with a production cross section 3.2 times of that predicted by the standard model.

The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. The H to tau tau signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The best fit of the product of the observed H to tau tau signal production cross section and branching fraction is 1.09+ 0.27-0.26 times the standard model expectation. The combination with the corresponding measurement performed with data collected by the CMS experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV leads to an observed significance of 5.9 standard deviations, equal to the expected significance.
