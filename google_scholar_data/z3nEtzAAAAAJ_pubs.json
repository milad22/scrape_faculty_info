            "HVTN 505 is a preventative vaccine efficacy trial testing DNA followed by recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) in circumcised, Ad5-seronegative men and transgendered persons who have sex with men in the United States. Identified immune correlates of lower HIV-1 risk and a virus sieve analysis revealed that, despite lacking overall efficacy, vaccine-elicited responses exerted pressure on infecting HIV-1 viruses. To interrogate the mechanism of the antibody correlate of HIV-1 risk, we examined antigen-specific antibody recruitment of Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and the role of anti-envelope (anti-Env) IgG3. In a prespecified immune correlates analysis, antibody-dependent monocyte phagocytosis and antibody binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa correlated with decreased HIV-1 risk. Follow-up analyses revealed that anti-Env IgG3 breadth correlated with reduced HIV-1 risk, anti \u2026",

            "Background Streptococcus pneumoniae causes about 826,000 deaths of children in the world each year and many health facility visits. To reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease, many nations have added pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to their national immunization schedules. Nicaragua was the first country eligible for GAVI Alliance funding to introduce the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2010, provided to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The goal of this study was to evaluate the population impact of the first five years of the program.   Methods Numbers of visits for pneumonia, pneumonia-related deaths, and bacterial meningitis in both children and adults, and infant deaths between 2008 and 2015 were collected from all 107 public health facilities in Le\u00f3n Department. Vital statistics data provided additional counts of pneumonia-related deaths that occurred outside health facilities. Adjusted incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRa) in the vaccine (2011\u20132015) and pre-vaccine periods (2008\u20132010) were estimated retrospectively using official population estimates as exposure time.   Results The IRRa for pneumonia hospitalizations was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) for infants, and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99) for one year-olds. The IRRa for post-neonatal infant mortality was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.77). In the population as a whole, ambulatory visits and hospitalizations for pneumonia, as well as pneumonia-related mortality and rates of bacterial meningitis were lower in the vaccine period.   Conclusions During the first five years of program implementation, reductions were observed in health \u2026",

            "Background Zika virus caused thousands of congenital anomalies during a recent epidemic. Because Zika emerged in areas endemic for dengue and these related flaviviruses elicit cross-reactive antibodies, it is challenging to serologically monitor pregnant women for Zika infection.   Methods A prospective cohort of 253 pregnant women was established in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua. Women were followed during prenatal care through delivery. Serologic specimens were obtained at each visit, and birth outcome was recorded. Established flavivirus serologic methods were adapted to determine Zika seroprevalence, and a stepwise testing algorithm estimated timing of Zika infection in relation to pregnancy.   Results Zika seroprevalence was approximately 59% among women tested. Neutralization testing was highly concordant with Zika NS1 BOB results. Per study algorithm, 21% (40\/187) of women were classified as experiencing Incident ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Importantly, the Incident ZIKV group included mostly women pregnant during the 2016 Zika epidemic peak and the only 3 subjects in the cohort with RT-PCR-confirmed infections. Approximately 17% of births had complications; 1.5% (3\/194) manifesting clinical criteria of congenital Zika syndrome, one was RT-PCR-confirmed as a case of congenital Zika syndrome. Adverse birth outcome did not correlate with timing of Zika infection.   Conclusions By leveraging prenatal care systems, we developed a simple algorithm for identifying women who were likely infected by Zika during pregnancy.",
