            "Ag2S nanoparticles are increasingly important in biomedicine, such as in cancer imaging. However, there has been only limited success in the exploration of theranostic Ag2S nanoparticles for photoinduced cancer imaging and simultaneous therapy. Here we report size-dependent Ag2S nanodots (NDs) with well-defined nanostructure as a theranostic agent for multimodal imaging and simultaneous photothermal therapy. The NDs are precisely synthesized through carefully controlled growth of Ag2S in hollow human serum albumin nanocages. These NDs produce effective fluorescence in second near-infrared (NIR-II) region, distinct photoacoustic intensity, and good photothermal conversion in a size-dependent manner under light irradiation, thereby generating sufficient in vivo fluorescence and photoacoustic signals as well as potent hyperthermia at tumors. Moreover, Ag2S NDs possess ideal resistance to \u2026",

            "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging clinically approved modality, has been used for treatment of various cancer diseases. Conventional PDT strategies are mainly focused on superficial lesions because the wavelength of illumination light of most clinically approved photosensitizers (PSs) is located in the UV\/VIS range that possesses limited tissue penetration ability, leading to ineffective therapeutic response for deep\u2010seated tumors. The combination of PDT and nanotechnology is becoming a promising approach to fight against deep tumors. Here, the rapid development of new PDT modalities based on various smartly designed nanocomposites integrating with conventionally used PSs for deep tumor treatments is introduced. Until now many types of multifunctional nanoparticles have been studied, and according to the source of excitation energy they can be classified into three major groups: near \u2026",

X-ray is considered as an ideal energy source to activate photosensitizers (PSs) located deep within the body with the assistance of scintillating nanoparticles (ScNPs). However, the efficacy under this concept is not satisfying due to the low scintillating luminescence and weak energy transfer from ScNPs to PSs. Here, mesoporous LaF3:Tb ScNPs were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process to act as PS carriers and X-ray energy transducers, owing to their good ionizing radiation stopping power and high luminescence efficiency. The formation mechanism of porous structure was elucidated in detail with classical crystallization theory.
