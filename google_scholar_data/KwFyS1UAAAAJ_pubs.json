If there is a holographic dual to dS spaces, defined analogously to the AdS\/conformal field theory correspondence, our methods compute the (Euclidean) stress tensor of the dual. We compute the masses of Schwarzschild\u2013de Sitter black holes in four and five dimensions, and the masses and angular momenta of Kerr\u2013de Sitter spaces in three dimensions. All these spaces are less massive than de Sitter space, a fact which we use to qualitatively and quantitatively relate de Sitter entropy to the degeneracy of possible dual field theories. Our results in general dimensions lead to a conjecture: Any asymptotically de Sitter spacetime with mass greater than de Sitter space has a cosmological singularity.
