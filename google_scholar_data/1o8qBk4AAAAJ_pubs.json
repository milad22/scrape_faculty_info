            "Diagnostic techniques based on optical spectroscopy have the potential to link the biochemical and morphological properties of tissues to individual patient care. In particular, these techniques are fast, noninvasive and quantitative. Furthermore, they can be used to elucidate key tissue features, such as the cellular metabolic rate, vascularity, intravascular oxygenation and alterations in tissue morphology. These tissue features can be interpreted to shed light on a variety of clinical problems, such as precancerous and cancerous growth and atherosclerosis. The goal of this report is to review the development and application of optical spectroscopy in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) spectral regions, as a diagnostic tool in clinical applications. A particular emphasis is placed on steady\u2010state, UV\/VIS fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection of precancers and cancers, in vivo.",

Experiments and simulations using a single probe revealed that scattering-induced artefacts appeared in fluorescence emission spectra, while fluorescence lifetimes were unchanged. Although fluorescence lifetime measurements are generally more robust to scattering artefacts than are measurements of fluorescence spectra, in the dual-probe geometry scattering-induced changes in apparent lifetime were predicted both from diffusion theory and via Monte Carlo simulation, as well as measured experimentally.

Most popular applications have concentrated on female breast imaging, neonatal and adult head imaging, as well as muscle and small animal studies. In most instances a highly scattering medium with a homogeneous refractive index is assumed throughout the imaging domain. Using these assumptions, it is possible to simplify the model to the diffusion approximation. However, biological tissue contains regions of varying optical absorption and scatter, as well as varying refractive index. In this work, we introduce an internal boundary constraint in the finite element method approach to modelling light propagation through tissue that accounts for regions of different refractive indices.

In this study, a light transport model has been developed based upon the three-dimensional frequency-domain simplified spherical harmonics (SP N) approximation for orders up to N= 7. The SP N data are tested against a semi-infinite multi-layered Monte Carlo model. It has been shown that the SP N approximation for higher orders (N> 1) provides an increase in accuracy over the diffusion equation specifically near sources and at boundaries of regions with increased optical absorption. It is demonstrated that the error of fluence calculated near the sources between the diffusion approximation and the SP N model (N= 7) can be as large as 60%, therefore limiting the use of the diffusion \u2026",

For reflectance, quantitative agreement between simulation and experiment was achieved to better than 11%. Fluorescence data and simulations were used to extract the ratio of the absorption coefficients of constituent fluorophores for each measured AC tissue sample. This ratio could be used to monitor relative changes in concentration of the constituent fluorophores \u2026",
