This deviation goes up to 3.4 \u03c3 level when the two measurements in the D and D* modes are taken together and could indicate new physics. Using an effective Lagrangian for the new physics, we study the implication of these results and calculate other observables that can shed light on the nature of the new physics. We show that the measurements of the forward-backward asymmetries and the \u03c4 and D* polarization fractions can be distinguished among the various couplings of the new physics operators.",

We present the full three angle and q 2 angular distribution with new physics operators with complex couplings. Various observables are constructed from the angular distribution with special focus on the CP violating triple product asymmetries which vanish in the Standard Model without any hadronic complications. Two of the three triple products are only sensitive to vector\/axial vector new physics operators. Hence, the measurements of non-zero triple-product asymmetries will be a clear sign of new physics and a strong signal for vector\/axial vector new physics operators. Even though we focus on \u03c4 final state, one can use the triple-products to search for new physics with e and \u03bc in the final state.",

We also briefly discuss possible extensions of the standard model where these operators can be generated.",

If taken at face value, this can be interpreted as a nonzero phase of mixing (\u03b2 s), in disagreement with the standard model, which predicts that \u03b2 s\u2243 0. In this paper, we argue that this analysis may be incomplete. In particular, there can be new physics (NP) in the decay. If so, the value of \u03b2 s is different than for the case in which NP is assumed to be present only in the mixing. We have examined several models of NP and found that, indeed, there can be significant contributions to the decay. These effects are consistent with measurements in B\u2192 J\/\u03c8K* and B 0 d\u2192 J\/\u03c8K S. Due to the NP in the decay, polarization-dependent indirect CP asymmetries and triple-product asymmetries are predicted in B 0 s\u2192 J\/\u03c8\u03c6.",
