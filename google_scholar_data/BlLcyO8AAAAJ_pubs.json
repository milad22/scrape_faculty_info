            "The ability to foresee the next moves of a user is crucial to ubiquitous computing. Disregarding major differences in individuals' routines, recent ground-breaking analysis on mobile phone data suggests high predictability in mobility. By nature, however, mobile phone data offer very low spatial and temporal resolutions. It remains largely unknown how the predictability changes with respect to different spatial\/temporal scales. Using high-resolution GPS data, this paper investigates the scaling effects on predictability. Given specified spatial-temporal scales, recorded trajectories are encoded into long strings of distinct locations, and several information-theoretic measures of predictability are derived. Somewhat surprisingly, high predictability is still present at very high spatial\/temporal resolutions. Moreover, the predictability is independent of the overall mobility area covered. This suggests highly regular mobility \u2026",

There have been rather successful attempts in detecting the mode of transport from GPS logs such as walking, driving or taking a bus, which has found varied applications. However, the best-known schemes either require tedious manual labelling or pre-training process (or both). We present MoDetect (MD), a unsupervised scheme which eliminates the need of manual labelling and pre-training while attaining equal or greater accuracy compared with the best-known supervised methods. MD can also cater for differences in individual's behaviours, and hence may be more widely applicable than the existing schemes. To achieve this, MD relies on Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test which offers a theoretical assurance when computing similarity between \u2026",

            "Biased random walk has been studied extensively over the past decade especially in the transport and communication networks communities. The mean first passage time (MFPT) of a biased random walk is an important performance indicator in those domains. While the fundamental matrix approach gives precise solution to MFPT, the computation is expensive and the solution lacks interpretability. Other approaches based on the Mean Field Theory relate MFPT to the node degree alone. However, nodes with the same degree may have very different local weight distribution, which may result in vastly different MFPT. We derive an approximate bound to the MFPT of biased random walk with short relaxation time on complex network where the biases are controlled by arbitrarily assigned node weights. We show that the MFPT of a node in this general case is closely related to not only its node degree, but also its local weight distribution. The MFPTs obtained from computer simulations also agree with the new theoretical analysis. Our result enables fast estimation of MFPT, which is useful especially to differentiate between nodes that have very different local node weight distribution even though they share the same node degrees.",

            "Previous studies suggest that human mobility is highly regular in two respects. Firstly, individual's travels are governed by occasional exploration of new locations and preferential return to most frequently visited locations. Secondly, human mobility sequences exhibit high predictability. The existing model [1] is able to mimic exploration and preferential return, and lit actual mobility data. However, the high predictability issue is not addressed in this model. In this paper, we derive an upper bound of the predictability manifested by this model. Motivated by the incorrigible gap between the bound and the empirical results shown in [2], we further propose a new Markovian model by modifying the rule of preferential return to be conditional on the individuals' current location. We show both theoretically and empirically that the new Markovian model presents high predictability while preserving the desirable scaling properties \u2026",

To focus on specific subsets of large document corpora, a user may specify various criteria to identify documents of interest before extracting topics from the documents. In this paper, we aim to accelerate the computation of topic models for documents that satisfy range queries. Our strategy is to create indexes for identifying documents, and pre-compute the topic models for certain subsets of documents. The indexes enable to efficiently identify the exact set (called the Canonical Set) of documents that fall within the user-specified range. The target topic model is computed by combining the pre-computed models associated with the Canonical Set of documents.

Since the problem was shown to be NP-hard, it is computationally challenging to obtain an optimal solution. We first review an efficient 2-phase block stowage scheme which can generate a feasible initial solution in just a few minutes. Since the algorithm relies heavily on checking whether any constraints will be violated by stowing a container at a specific location, we investigate the impact of changing the order in which the constraints are checked on the execution time of the algorithm. We evaluate seven different strategies for ordering the sequence in which the constraints are tested. Experiments based on real stowage instances show that, by strategically reordering the constraints test sequence, we can achieve 2 times speedup on the stowage planning algorithm on average, and up to 33 times speedup in certain \u2026",

Because these networks could contain millions of nodes, any ranking algorithm must have low time requirements to be practically useful.

Although these studies are able to show high predicting accuracy of individuals' next move, two basic assumptions of these studies, namely the stationarity of individuals' mobility sequence and the dependency of visiting the locations, have never been validated. Moreover, a famous recent research suggests that individuals prefer to revisit the locations merely according to the visitation frequency. In this paper, we study these two presumed properties of individuals' mobility sequence. Specifically, stationarity is validated by analyzing the autocorrelation of the mobility sequences that are encoded under three popular schemes. With appropriate choice of spatial and temporal scale, two types of periodicity, e.g., daily and weekly, are observed. The visiting dependency between the locations is validated by \u2026",
