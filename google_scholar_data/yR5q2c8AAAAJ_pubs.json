            "Purpose: To localize pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in developing and adult human ocular tissues. Methods: PEDF was localized in fetal and adult eyes by immunofluorescence with a polyclonal antibody (pAb) against amino acids 327-343 of PEDF, or a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the C-terminal 155 amino acids of PEDF. Specificity of the antibodies was documented by Western blotting. PEDF mRNA was localized in adult retina by in situ hybridization.Results: In developing retinas (7.4 to 21.5 fetal weeks, Fwks), pAb anti-PEDF labeled retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) granules, developing cones, some neuroblasts and many cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). In adult retinas, pAb anti-PEDF labeled rod and cone cytoplasm and nuclei of rods but not cones. Cells in the INL and GCL, choroid, corneal epithelium and endothelium, and ciliary body were also pAb PEDF-positive. Preadsorption of pAb anti-PEDF with the immunizing peptide blocked specific labeling in retina and other tissues, except for photoreceptor outer segments. In agreement with the immunolocalization with pAb anti-PEDF, in situ hybridization revealed PEDF mRNA in the RPE, photoreceptors, inner nuclear layer cells and ganglion cells in adult retina. In developing retinas 18 Fwks and older, and in adult retinas, mAb anti-PEDF labeled the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM). Western blots of retina, cornea, and ciliary body\/iris with pAb anti-PEDF produced several bands at about 46 kDa. With mAb anti-PEDF, retina produced one band at about 46 kDa; cornea and ciliary body\/iris had several bands at about 46 kDa. Conclusions: PEDF, originally reported as a \u2026",

Gene transfer to the eye using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors is a promising new treatment for inherited and acquired ocular diseases. We used an AAV vector with rapid onset and high levels of gene expression in the retina to deliver three anti-angiogenic factors (pigment epithelium-derived factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, and endostatin) to the eyes of mice in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity. All three vectors inhibited ischemia-induced neovascularization.",

            "Purpose: Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) is a 50 kDa secretable protein with neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and antiangiogenic properties. Expression patterns in the human eye suggest that modulation of this protein over time and place may play a role in development of normal ocular vasculature. Because of the potential importance of normal PEDF expression patterns in controlling ocular blood vessel growth in health and disease, we characterized these patterns over the period of retinal vascular development in the mouse.Methods: Eyes from CD1 mice (embryonic days E 14.5, 18.5, P0, P4, P7, P14, and Adult) were cryosectioned and examined. A polyclonal PEDF antibody was used to locate PEDF protein using immunohistochemical techniques while a PEDF RNA probe was used to localize PEDF mRNA by in situ hybridization. Results: Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization showed initial expression in the ciliary body and choroid during mid-gestation. Near term, relative protein levels increased in the ganglion cell layer and remained high through the first two weeks postnatal. Levels qualitatively decreased after this point but persisted through adulthood. Relative levels of expression in the inner retina were much higher at all timepoints than in the outer retina. Conclusions: These expression patterns likely maintain the vitreous and aqueous humors as avascular spaces and may also control vascular development in the inner\/outer retina.",

These strategies have different assessment and incentive structures for participation. Non-cognitive skills are assessed in ALG using a subjective five-point Likert scale. In TBL, assessment of individual student preparation is based on a multiple choice quiz conducted at the beginning of each session.Methods: We studied first-year medical student participation and performance in ALG and TBL as well as performance on course final examinations.Results: Student performance in TBL, but not in ALG, was strongly correlated with final examination scores.

The pre-intervention phase established baseline ordering volume as each resident rotated through the various clinical services. The intervention consisted of a 1-hour educational seminar detailing the potential harm and costs of laboratory overutilization followed by the post intervention phase, which consisted of weekly feedback reports graphically illustrating individual versus group ordering patterns, where the identity of individual residents was protected. The total numbers of tests ordered during the 2 phases were compared using an independent t test.Results: During the post intervention phase, we observed a net reduction of 21% in tests ordered\u2014an average of 941 tests per week\u2014with the greatest reduction in the chemistry section of the laboratory, followed by hematology, coagulation, and all others combined.
