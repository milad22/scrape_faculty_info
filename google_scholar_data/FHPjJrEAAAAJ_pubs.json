The temporal and spatial dependent magnetization order parameter m (r, t) generates both electrical and spin currents that provide dissipation of the energy and angular momentum of the processing magnet. The resulting LLG equation contains highly spatial dependence of damping term and thus micromagnetic simulations based on the standard LLG equation should be reexamined for magnetization dynamics involving narrow domain walls and spin waves with short wavelengths.",

Probing the spin texture of these states is of critical importance for the realization of topological insulator devices, but the main technique currently available is spin-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Here we reveal a close link between the spin texture and a new kind of magnetoresistance, which depends on the relative orientation of the current with respect to the magnetic field as well as the crystallographic axes, and scales linearly with both the applied electric and magnetic fields. This bilinear magnetoelectric resistance can be used to map the spin texture of topological surface states by simple transport measurements.

We theoretically investigate the magnetotransport in such bilayer structures by solving the spinor Boltzmann transport equation with the generalized Fuchs-Sondheimer boundary condition that takes into account the effect of spin-orbit scattering at the interface. We find that the new AMR exhibits a peculiar angular dependence which can serve as a genuine experimental signature.

A small change in the longitudinal resistance of the bilayer has been observed when reversing the direction of either the applied in-plane current or the magnetization. We attribute such nonlinear transport behavior to the spin-polarization dependence of the electron mobility in the FM layer acting in concert with the spin accumulation induced in that layer by the spin Hall current originating in the bulk of the HM layer. An explicit expression for the nonlinear magnetoresistance is derived based on a simple drift-diffusion model, which shows that the nonlinear magnetoresistance appears at the first order of the spin Hall angle, and changes sign when the current is reversed, in agreement with the experimental observations.

Nevertheless, recent experiments have shown that the effect also occurs in a nonmagnetic metal (Pt) in contact with a magnetic insulator [yttrium iron garnet (YIG)], even when precautions are taken to ensure that there is no induced magnetization in the metal. We propose a theory of this effect based on the combined action of spin-dependent scattering from the magnetic interface and the spin-Hall effect in the bulk of the metal. At variance with previous theories, we predict the effect to be of first order in the spin-orbit coupling, just as the conventional anomalous Hall effect\u2014the only difference being the spatial separation of the spin-orbit interaction and the magnetization.

This study reports TSS-induced switching in a bilayer consisting of a topological insulator Bi2Se3 and an insulating ferromagnet BaFe12O19. A charge current in Bi2Se3 can switch the magnetization in BaFe12O19 up and down. When the magnetization is switched by a field, a current in Bi2Se3 can reduce the switching field by ~4000 Oe.
