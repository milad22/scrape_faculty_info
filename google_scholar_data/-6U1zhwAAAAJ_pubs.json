            "Using free-free emission measured in the Ka band (26-40 GHz) for 10 star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy NGC 6946, including its starbursting nucleus, we compare a number of star formation rate (SFR) diagnostics that are typically considered to be unaffected by interstellar extinction. These diagnostics include non-thermal radio (ie, 1.4 GHz), total infrared (IR; 8-1000 \u03bcm), and warm dust (ie, 24 \u03bcm) emission, along with hybrid indicators that attempt to account for obscured and unobscured emission from star-forming regions including H\u03b1+ 24 \u03bcm and UV+ IR measurements. The assumption is made that the 33 GHz free-free emission provides the most accurate measure of the current SFR. Among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the 24 \u03bcm, H\u03b1+ 24 \u03bcm, and UV+ IR SFR calibrations are in good agreement with the 33 GHz free-free SFRs. However, each of the SFR calibrations relying on some form of dust \u2026",

We have obtained 11.7 and 18.7 \u03bcm images of this region at the Keck telescope and find that it is an extremely strong mid\u2010infrared emitter. The infrared\u2010to\u2010radio flux ratio rules out a supernova and is consistent with an H ii region excited by a dense cluster of young stars. This \u201csupernebula\u201d provides at least 15% of the total bolometric luminosity of the galaxy. Its excitation requires 105\u2013106 stars, giving it the total mass and size (1\u20132 pc diameter) of a globular cluster. However, its high obscuration, small size, and high gas density all argue that it is very young, no more than a few hundred thousand years old. This may be \u2026",

A spectral index map constructed from the 6 and 2 cm images indicates that thermal free-free emission from ionized gas, most of it from a single source, dominates the radio emission. The unusually high fraction of free-free emission suggests that the starburst is very young. Regions of diffuse nonthermal synchrotron emission and probable supernova remnants surround the central radio source.
