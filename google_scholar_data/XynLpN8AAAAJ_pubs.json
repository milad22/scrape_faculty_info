            "Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) on the basis of polymer:fullerene blends have delivered numerous impressive results in the last decade and thus have drawn much attention of the scientific and industrial communities. However, BHJ PSCs often suffer from several intrinsic problems, such as the low open-circuit voltage (Voc), energetically-unfavorable and chemically-incompatible interfaces, and morphological phase separation of the polymer:fullerene blend driven by thermal treatment, hindering further advancement. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on applications of fullerene-based materials in the BHJ PSCs. Bis-adduct fullerenes possessing high-lying LUMO energy levels can substitute for mono-substituted fullerenes and higher Voc values can thus be achieved.

            "In this work, a combined approach was used to obtain a low-cost material for organic electronics by focusing on inexpensive monomers, short synthetic pathway, high-yielding polymerization method, low waste, and easy scalability. To achieve this, a new material, poly[isoindigo-alt-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene], was synthesized using direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP). Only a few synthetic steps are required to obtain this material, and no organometallic intermediates are used. In order to make a bigger step toward a truly inexpensive technology, continuous flow methods were applied for the first time to DHAP. This method helped solving a common problem encountered in conjugated polymers synthesis, namely, batch-to-batch variations. Electronic properties of this polymeric material were evaluated using field effect transistors (\u03bch = 7 \u00d7 10\u20133 cm2\u00b7V\u20131\u00b7s\u20131) and solar cells (\u03b7 = 3.0%).",
