            "Continuous-time analog neural networks with symmetric connections will always converge to fixed points when the neurons have infinitely fast response, but can oscillate when a small time delay is present. Sustained oscillation resulting from time delay is relevant to hardware implementations of neural networks where delay due to the finite switching speed of amplifiers can be appreciable compared to the network relaxation time. We analyze the dynamics of continuous-time analog networks with delay, and show that there is a critical delay above which a symmetrically connected network will oscillate. Two different stability analyses are presented for low and high neuron gain. The results are useful as design criteria for building fast but stable electronic networks. We find that for some connection topologies, a delay much smaller than the relaxation time can lead to oscillation, whereas for other topologies, including \u2026",

In contrast, when the HGMC was magnetized, the magnetic beads were efficiently pulled from the initial flow path into the collection stream, thereby cleansing the original fluid.

            "We demonstrate the guiding of neutral atoms by the magnetic fields due to microfabricated current-carrying wires on a chip. Atoms are guided along a magnetic field minimum parallel to and above the current-carrying wires. Two guide configurations are demonstrated: one using two wires with an external magnetic field, and a second using four wires without an external field. These guide geometries can be extended to integrated atom optics circuits, including beam splitters.",

They consist of multiple layers of lithographically defined Au wires separated by transparent, insulating polyimide layers on sapphire substrates. Magnetic field patterns produced by these devices allow microscopically precise control and manipulation of magnetic nanoparticles. A microelectromagnet matrix produces single or multiple peaks in the magnetic field magnitude, which trap, move, and rotate magnetic nanoparticles, as well as electromagnetic fields to probe and detect particles. Microelectromagnets are new tools with which to study and manipulate nanoparticles and biological entities.",
