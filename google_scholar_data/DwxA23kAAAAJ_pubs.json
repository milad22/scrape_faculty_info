            "In this review we discuss the mechanisms of reactions between very heavy ions, with emphasis on a recently discovered process known by the various names of deep inelastic transfer, quasi-fission, strongly damped collisions and relaxed pro cesses. Apart from the very early pioneering experiment (1) and a few studies in the early 1970s (2, 3), this new reaction process began to be clearly recognized in 1973-1974 (4-8). The characteristic features (4-37) of this new reaction mechanism for heavy ions are the following.1. Damping of the initial relative kinetic energy of the target and projectile nuclei takes place, resulting in a range of binary-product kinetic energies down to the Coulomb energies for charge centers of highly deformed fragments. The events that are the most relaxed are reminiscent of nuclear fission. What fraction of the kinetic-energy loss initially goes into internal excitation energy rather than into \u2026",
