The ratio of the form factors is directly proportional to the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal components of the polarization of the recoil proton in the elastic e\u2192 p\u2192 e p\u2192 reaction. The new data presented span the range 3.5< Q 2< 5.6 GeV 2 and are well described by a linear Q 2 fit. Also, the ratio Q 2 F 2 p\/F 1 p reaches a constant value above Q 2= 2 GeV 2.",
