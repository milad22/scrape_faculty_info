            "The fabrication methods and physical properties of ordered magnetic nanostructures with dimensions on the submicron to nanometer scale are reviewed. First, various types of nanofabrication techniques are described, and their capabilities and limitations in achieving magnetic nanostructures are discussed. Specifically, we address electron beam lithography, X-ray lithography, laser interference lithography, scanning probe lithography, step growth methods, nanoimprint, shadow masks, radiation damage, self-assembled structures, and the use of nanotemplates. Then the magnetic properties of these nanostructures are reviewed, including properties of single dots, magnetic interactions in arrays, dynamic effects, magnetic behavior of nanostructured lines and wires, giant magnetoresistance effect, and properties of films with arrays of holes. Finally, the physical properties in hybrid systems, where the magnetic \u2026",

We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.",

In particular, we focus on the nucleation and saturation processes. The onset of magnetization reversal is dominated by irreversible processes corresponding to the avalanchelike propagation of one-dimensional stripe domains that originate from earlier nucleated zero-dimensional bubble domains. In a second stage we observe mainly reversible behavior where the overall domain topology is preserved. Finally another irreversible process brings the sample to negative saturation, corresponding to the contraction and annihilation of domains.

For example, they can be driven very efficiently by electrical currents, and exhibit many new physical properties determined by their real-space topological characteristics.

            "Real-time magneto-optical indicator film images reveal distinct asymmetry in the motion of a single domain wall in a wedged-NiFe\/uniform-FeMn bilayer due to the nucleation and behavior of an exchange spring in the antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetization reversal from the ground state begins at the thick end of the wedge where the exchange anisotropy field (H E) is minimal and the magnetostatic field (H MS) is maximal, whereas reversal into the ground state begins from the thin end where H E is maximal and H MS is minimal.",
