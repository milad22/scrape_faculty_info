            "Differential evolution (DE) is arguably one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter optimization algorithms in current use. DE operates through similar computational steps as employed by a standard evolutionary algorithm (EA). However, unlike traditional EAs, the DE-variants perturb the current-generation population members with the scaled differences of randomly selected and distinct population members. Therefore, no separate probability distribution has to be used for generating the offspring. Since its inception in 1995, DE has drawn the attention of many researchers all over the world resulting in a lot of variants of the basic algorithm with improved performance. This paper presents a detailed review of the basic concepts of DE and a survey of its major variants, its application to multiobjective, constrained, large scale, and uncertain optimization problems, and the theoretical studies conducted on DE so \u2026",

            "Lipids are the most effective source of storage energy, function as insulators of delicate internal organs and hormones and play an important role as the structural constituents of most of the cellular membranes. They also have a vital role in tolerance to several physiological stressors in a variety of organisms including cyanobacteria. The mechanism of desiccation tolerance relies on phospholipid bilayers which are stabilized during water stress by sugars, especially by trehalose. Unsaturation of fatty acids also counteracts water or salt stress. Hydrogen atoms adjacent to olefinic bonds are susceptible to oxidative attack. Lipids are rich in these bonds and are a primary target for oxidative reactions. Lipid oxidation is problematic as enzymes do not control many oxidative chemical reactions and some of the products of the attack are highly reactive species that modify proteins and DNA. This review deals with the role of lipids and fatty acids in stress tolerance in cyanobacteria.",

The dried roots of the plant are used in the treatment of nervous and sexual disorders. From chemistry point of view, the drug contains group of biologically active constituents known as withanolides. The chemical structures of withanolides have been studied and they are widely distributed in family Solanacae. Withaferin-A is therapeutically active withanolide reported to be present in leaves. In animal studies, withaferin-A has shown significant anticancer activity. Majority of the anticancer drugs like Vinblastine, Vincristine, and Taxol have been derived from green flora. Today there is much interest in natural products with anticancer activity. Withanolides are of under research potential as far treatment of cancer is concerned. The article reviews the scope of studies published in favor of anticancer potential of withaferin-A.",

However, industrial-scale Taxol\u00ae production using fungal endophytes, although seemingly promising, has not seen the light of the day. In this opinion article, we embark on the current state of knowledge on Taxol\u00ae biosynthesis focusing on the chemical ecology of its producers, and ask whether it is actually possible to produce Taxol\u00ae using endophyte biotechnology.

            "I still recall the sleepy hours of the night of the 30th December, 1960, spent at Birbanki, about twentyeight miles south of Khunti, across the wild range of\u201cwinding and crooked hills\u201d. A song (mentioned earlier, from which the title of the book has been derived) of the Ulgulan (the Great Tumult, as the Mundas recall their last movement under Birsa Munda) lyrically rendered in bhajan melody accompanied with the corresponding vigorous dance number round a winter bonfire, moved me to pursue the present study. I could not make any headway for pressure of work for almost two years and a half, though I absorbed and grew into my melieu. I discovered the manuscript written by Birsa's disciple and comrade-in-arm, Bharmi Munda, on the 22nd May, 1962, and also collected a number of folk songs on the move. ment. Slowly the work grew on me: I could not wrench it out of the historical context. A four-month interlude of leisure from official work enabled me to develop the work into a doctoral dissertation,\u201cBirsa Munda and his movement in Chotanagpur 1874-1901\u201d.",
