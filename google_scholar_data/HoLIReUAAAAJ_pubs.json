In the present study, we seek to investigate the feasibility of using PLA-F127-PLA vesicles as oral delivery carrier for insulin. Both in vitro and in vivo release behavior of insulin loaded in PLA-F127-PLA vesicles were studied. A biphasic release behavior was observed for the in vitro release of insulin from PLAF127-29 vesicles. More importantly, it was found in the diabetic mice tests that the blood glucose concentration of oral insulin-loaded PLAF127-29 vesicles decreased from 18.5 to 5.3 mmol\/L within 4.5 h and the minimum blood glucose concentration (about 4.5 mmol\/L) was achieved after about 5 h. Furthermore, the blood glucose concentration was maintained at this level for at least an additional 18.5 h. These results proved \u2026",

However, the existing encapsulation technologies, such as the thin film method and the ethanol injection method, are complex and require the use of organic solvents. In this study, an organic solvent-free and easily scalable encapsulation technique was studied by utilizing the pH-dependent solubility properties of curcumin. Phospholipid was dissolved in water to form liposomes. Curcumin was deprotonated and dissolved under alkaline conditions and then encapsulated into the liposomes after acidification. Morphological observation and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that curcumin liposomes had been successfully prepared.

The sophorolipid-coated curcumin nanoparticles formed using this mechanism were relatively small (61 nm) and negatively charged (\u221241 mV).
