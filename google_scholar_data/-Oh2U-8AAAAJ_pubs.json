            "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as a promising material system for optoelectronic applications, but their primary figure of merit, the room-temperature photoluminescence quantum yield (QY), is extremely low. The prototypical 2D material molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is reported to have a maximum QY of 0.6%, which indicates a considerable defect density. Here we report on an air-stable, solution-based chemical treatment by an organic superacid, which uniformly enhances the photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime of MoS2 monolayers by more than two orders of magnitude. The treatment eliminates defect-mediated nonradiative recombination, thus resulting in a final QY of more than 95%, with a longest-observed lifetime of 10.8 \u00b1 0.6 nanoseconds. Our ability to obtain optoelectronic monolayers with near-perfect properties opens the door for the development of \u2026",

New functional electrode materials are urgently needed for next\u2010generation energy storage systems, such as supercapacitors or batteries, to meet the ever increasing demand for higher energy and power densities. Advances in nanotechnology are essential to meet those future challenges. It is critical to develop ways of synthesizing new nanomaterials with enhanced properties or combinations of properties to meet future challenges.

The size of the moment is correlated with the suppression of superconductivity, consistent with the magnetic-pair-breaking effect. The ground states of the dopants have also been determined.",
