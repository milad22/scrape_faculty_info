            "We show that the emergence of the axial anomaly is a universal phenomenon for a generic three-dimensional metal in the presence of parallel electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. In contrast to the expectations of the classical theory of magnetotransport, this intrinsically quantum mechanical phenomenon gives rise to the longitudinal magnetoresistance for any three-dimensional metal. However, the emergence of the axial anomaly does not guarantee the existence of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. We show this through an explicit calculation of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in the quantum limit using the Boltzmann equation, for both short-range neutral and long-range ionic impurity scattering processes. We demonstrate that the ionic scattering contributes a large positive magnetoconductivity\u221d B 2 in the quantum limit, which can cause a strong negative magnetoresistance for any three \u2026",

By considering an interacting deterministic model with an incommensurate potential in one dimension we find that the single-particle mobility edge in the noninteracting system leads to a many-body mobility edge in the corresponding interacting system for certain parameter regimes. Using exact diagonalization, we probe the mobility edge via energy resolved entanglement entropy (EE) and study the energy resolved applicability (or failure) of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Our numerical results indicate that the transition separating area and volume law scaling of the EE does not coincide with the nonthermal to thermal transition. Consequently, there exists an extended nonergodic phase for an intermediate energy window where the many-body eigenstates violate the ETH while manifesting volume law EE \u2026",

The self-dual condition for this general model turns out to be a simple closed form function of the model parameters and energy. We introduce the typical density of states as an order parameter for localization in quasiperiodic systems. By direct calculations of the inverse participation ratio and the typical density of states we numerically verify that this self-dual line indeed defines a mobility edge in energy separating localized and extended states.

We show that as a function of the disorder strength a half-filled (ie, undoped) Dirac semimetal displays three distinct ground states, namely an incompressible semimetal, a compressible diffusive metal, and a localized Anderson insulator, in stark contrast to a conventional dirty metal that only supports the latter two phases. We establish the existence of two distinct quantum critical points, which respectively govern the semimetal-metal and the metal-insulator quantum phase transitions and also reveal their underlying multifractal nature.

A particular focus is on Kondo destruction, which leads to quantum criticality that goes beyond the Landau framework of order-parameter fluctuations. This unconventional quantum criticality has provided an understanding of the unusual dynamical scaling observed experimentally. It also predicted a sudden jump of the Fermi surface and an extra (Kondo destruction) energy scale, both of which have been verified by systematic experiments. Considerations of Kondo destruction have in addition yielded a global phase diagram, which has motivated the current interest in heavy fermion materials with variable dimensionality or geometrical frustration.
