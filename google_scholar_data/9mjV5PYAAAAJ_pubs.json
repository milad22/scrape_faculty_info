A two-fold methodological approach was adopted: a methodological assessment identified RCTs of \u2018medium\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 methodological quality. Exercise quality was subsequently assessed according to the predominant exercise used. Outcome measures were analysed based on current recommendations. Fifty-four relevant RCTs were identified, of which 51 were scored for methodological quality. Sixteen RCTs involving 1730 patients qualified for inclusion in this review based upon their methodological quality, and chronicity of symptoms; exercise had a positive effect in all 16 trials. Twelve out of 16 programmes incorporated strengthening exercise, of which 10 \u2026",

Methods: Two separate studies were undertaken. A pressure algometer was used in both studies to assess PPT in the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Force was increased at a rate of 5 N \/s. In study 1, two measurements were taken from 240 healthy volunteers (120 males, 120 females; mean age 25 years) giving a power for statistical analysis of \u03b2=0.80 at \u03b1=0.01. In study two, 30 subjects (15 males, 15 females mean age 28 years) were randomly selected from study one. Fourteen repeated PPT measurements were recorded at seven, 10 min intervals. Mean PPT data for gender groups, from both studies, were analysed using analysis of covariance with repeated measures, and age as the covariate. Results \u2026",

However, according to the results of in vivo studies, the effectiveness of this modality varies. Our purpose was to assess the putative effects of LLLT on healing using an experimental wound model.Design and Setting:We used a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled design with 2 within-subjects factors (wound and time) and 1 between-subjects factor (group). Data were collected in the laboratory setting.Subjects:Twenty-two healthy subjects (age= 21\u00b11 years, height= 175.6\u00b19.8 cm, mass= 76.2\u00b114.2 kg).Measurements:Two standardized 1.27-cm 2 abrasions were induced on the anterior forearm.

Thirty-six patients with chronic neck pain and limited cervical spine mobility participated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. Every patient was treated once with needle acupuncture at distant points, dry needling (DN) of local myofascial trigger points and sham laser acupuncture (Sham). Outcome measures were motion-related pain intensity (visual analogue scale, 0\u2013100 mm) and range of motion (ROM). In addition, patients scored changes of general complaints using an 11-point verbal rating scale. Patients were assessed immediately before and after each treatment by an independent (blinded) investigator.

            "This study evaluated the effects of varying frequency, intensity and stimulation site, of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in an experimental model of pain. In a double-blind design 240 volunteers were randomised to one of six experimental TENS groups, a sham TENS or control (n=30 per group; gender balanced). Two TENS frequencies (110 or 4 Hz) and two intensities (strong but comfortable or highest tolerable) at a fixed pulse duration (200 \u03bcs) were applied at three sites relative to the measurement site (segmentally, extrasegmentally or a combination of these), for 30 min. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured using a pressure algometer, in the first dorsal interosseous muscle, every 10 min, during stimulation and for a further 30 min. The high frequency, high intensity segmental, and combined stimulation groups, showed rapid onset and significant hypoalgesic effects. This effect was \u2026",
