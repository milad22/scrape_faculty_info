            "A class of recessive lethal zebrafish mutations has been identified in which normal skeletal muscle differentiation is followed by a tissue-specific degeneration that is reminiscent of the human muscular dystrophies. Here, we show that one of these mutations, sapje, disrupts the zebrafish orthologue of the X-linked human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene. Mutations in this locus cause Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies in human patients and are thought to result in a dystrophic pathology through disconnecting the cytoskeleton from the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle by reducing the level of dystrophin protein at the sarcolemma. This is thought to allow tearing of this membrane, which in turn leads to cell death. Surprisingly, we have found that the progressive muscle degeneration phenotype of sapje mutant zebrafish embryos is caused by the failure of embryonic muscle end attachments \u2026",

These regions are often large, containing hundreds of genes, which make experimental methods employed to identify the disease gene arduous and expensive. We present two methods to prioritize candidates for further experimental study: Common Pathway Scanning (CPS) and Common Module Profiling (CMP). CPS is based on the assumption that common phenotypes are associated with dysfunction in proteins that participate in the same complex or pathway. CPS applies network data derived from protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) and pathway databases to identify relationships between genes.

To achieve this, somitic cells are partitioned into lineage-restricted domains, whose fates are determined by signals secreted from adjacent tissues. While the molecular nature of many of the inductive signals that trigger formation of different cell fates within the nascent somite has been identified, less is known about the processes that coordinate the formation of the subsomitic compartments from which these cells arise. Utilizing a combination of vital dye-staining and lineage-tracking techniques, we describe a previously uncharacterized, lineage-restricted compartment of the zebrafish somite that generates muscle progenitor cells for the growth of appendicular, hypaxial, and axial muscles during development.

Subsequently, slow-twitch muscle cells migrate through the entire myotome, coming to lie at its most lateral surface.

We show that slow-twitch muscle cell morphogenesis is marked by behaviors typical of cells influenced by differential cell adhesion.

            "In the zebrafish embryo, two distinct classes of muscle fibers have been described in the forming myotome that arise from topographically separable precursor populations. Based entirely on cross\u2010reactivity with antibodies raised against mammalian and chick myosin heavy chain isoforms slow twitch muscle has been shown to arise exclusively from \u201cadaxial\u201d myoblasts, which migrate from their origin flanking the notochord to form a single layer of subcutaneous differentiated muscle cells. The remainder of the myotome differentiates behind this migration as muscle fibers recognized by anti\u2010fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) antibodies. To identify unambiguous molecular markers of cell fate in the myotome, we have characterized genes encoding zebrafish fast and slow MyHC. Using phylogenetic and expression analysis, we demonstrate that these genes are definitive molecular markers of slow and fast twitch fates \u2026",
