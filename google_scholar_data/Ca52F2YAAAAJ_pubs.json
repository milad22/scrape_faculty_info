Direct current neuromagnetic fields were measured during spontaneous onset of migraine auras in 4 migraine patients, and compared with recordings from 8 migraine\u2010with\u2010aura patients and 6 normal controls during visual stimulation of the occipital cortex. Complex direct current magnetoencephalographic shifts, similar in waveform, were observed in spontaneous and visually induced migraine patients, but not in controls. Two\u2010dimensional inverse imaging showed multiple cortical areas activated in spontaneous and visually induced migraine aura patients. In normal subjects, activation was only observed in the primary visual cortex.

Stimulator intensity was increased in 10% increments until subjects reported visual phenomena or 100% intensity was reached. Stimulator intensity was then fine\u2010tuned to determine the threshold at which phosphenes were seen.

To this end, data from nine epilepsy patients who participated in an auditory paired-click paradigm during pre-surgical evaluation and had grids of electrodes covering temporal and frontal lobe were analyzed. A distributed source localization approach was applied to the intracranial P50 response and the Gating Difference Wave obtained by subtracting the response to the second stimuli from the response to the first stimuli.Source reconstruction of the P50 showed that the main generators of the response were localized in the temporal lobes. The analysis also suggested that the maximum neuronal activity contributing to the amplitude reduction in the P50 time range (phenomenon of auditory sensory gating) is localized at the frontal lobe.Present findings \u2026",
