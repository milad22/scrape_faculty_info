            "G eant 4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250 eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in \u2026",

Electromagnetic showers from electrons and photons are detected in an array of CsI crystals located just inside the solenoidal coil of a superconducting magnet. Muons and neutral hadrons are identified by arrays of resistive plate chambers inserted into gaps in the steel flux return of the magnet. Charged hadrons are identified by dE\/dx measurements in the tracking detectors and by a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector surrounding the drift chamber. The trigger, data acquisition and data-monitoring systems, VME- and network-based, are controlled by custom-designed online software. Details of the layout and \u2026",

            "The four LEP Collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have collected a total of 2461 pb\u22121 of e+e\u2212 collision data at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The data are used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The search results of the four Collaborations are combined and examined in a likelihood test for their consistency with two hypotheses: the background hypothesis and the signal plus background hypothesis. The corresponding confidences have been computed as functions of the hypothetical Higgs boson mass. A lower bound of 114.4 GeV\/c2 is established, at the 95% confidence level, on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The LEP data are also used to set upper bounds on the HZZ coupling for various assumptions concerning the decay of the Higgs boson.",

            "We present an updated measurement of time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries in neutral B decays with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory at SLAC. This result uses an additional sample of \u03d2 (4 S) decays collected in 2001, bringing the data available to 32\u00d7 10 6 B B pairs. We select events in which one neutral B meson is fully reconstructed in a final state containing charmonium and the flavor of the other neutral B meson is determined from its decay products. The amplitude of the CP-violating asymmetry, which in the standard model is proportional to sin 2 \u03b2, is derived from the decay time distributions in such events. The result sin 2 \u03b2= 0.59\u00b10.14 (stat)\u00b10.05 (syst) establishes CP violation in the B 0 meson system. We also determine| \u03bb|= 0.93\u00b10.09 (stat)\u00b10.03 (syst), consistent with no direct CP violation.",

The data have been analysed in terms of a cluster algorithm and other topological quantities. The results are compared with 2nd order QCD calculations which incorporate models for the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into hadrons. At the higher energies we observe more spherical and 4-jet like events than predicted by these calculations. We cannot achieve a simultaneous description of the observed 3- and 4-jet production by adjusting the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s  or the fragmentation parameters of the 2nd order QCD models. The observed excess of spherical events can partially be explained by the production of multi-parton events expected from higher order QCD contributions.
