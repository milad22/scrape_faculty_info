            "The Eliashberg equations for superconductivity in a layered two-dimensional (2D) metal, taking into account the interaction between an electron and an arbitrary boson excitation, are obtained. The theory is applied to the case of a plasmon-mediated electron-electron interaction and it is shown that the interelectronic Coulomb repulsion parameter \u03bc is connected with both the bare Coulomb interaction and the single-particle excitation. An evaluation of this parameter shows that while remaining always positive, it decays with the decrease of the interlayer distance. It is also shown that the electron-plasmon interaction in a layered 2D system leads to a logarithmic divergence of the renormalization factor Z (\u03c9) as \u03c9\u2192 0 and T\u2192 0. This gives rise to a logarithmic dependence of \u03bb pl, the electron-plasmon interaction constant, on temperature for T\u2265 T c and a logarithmic dependence on the gap parameter \u0394 for T\u226a T c.

            "The self-energy of a layered two-dimensional (2D) electron gas has been investigated using the Fermi-liquid approach. The zero-and finite-temperature calculations including both single-particle and plasmon excitations have been carried out. It is found that when the interlayer distance is large compared to twice the effective Bohr radius a B, the interlayer-coupling effects are small and the results correspond to those of a pure 2D electron gas. When the interlayer distance is smaller than 2 a B, the results are similar to those of a three-dimensional (3D) system. At intermediate interlayer distances, the results show an interesting mixture of 2D and 3D behaviors. The linear temperature dependence of the plasmon contribution to the quasiparticle damping at high temperatures in a layered 2D electron gas, obtained in this paper, may have some relevance to the explanation of the normal-state properties of the high-T c \u2026",

A graphical derivative method based on Ward's identity is introduced to represent the contributions to the interparticle interactions from different channels. It is shown that pairing instability for the electrons excited from the Fermi sea may happen as a result of the presence of holes even when the original interaction is repulsive. Thus, in contrast to the Cooper instability caused by a given attractive interaction, the pairing instability can be induced by the particle-hole excitations.
