            "Single molecules of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were stretched with force-measuring laser tweezers. Under a longitudinal stress of \u223c65 piconewtons (pN), dsDNA molecules in aqueous buffer undergo a highly cooperative transition into a stable form with 5.8 angstroms rise per base pair, that is, 70% longer than B-form dsDNA. When the stress was relaxed below 65 pN, the molecules rapidly and reversibly contracted to their normal contour lengths. This transition was affected by changes in the ionic strength of the medium and the water activity or by cross-linking of the two strands of dsDNA. Individual molecules of single-stranded DNA were also stretched giving a persistence length of 7.5 angstroms and a stretch modulus of 800 pN. The overstretched form may play a significant role in the energetics of DNA recombination.",

Equilibrium positions of the beads were observed in an optical microscope while the beads were acted on by known magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. Extension versus force curves were obtained for individual DNA molecules at three different salt concentrations with forces between 10(-14) and 10(-11) newtons. Deviations from the force curves predicted by the freely jointed chain model suggest that DNA has significant local curvature in solution. Ethidium bromide and 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole had little effect on the elastic response of the molecules, but their extent of intercalation was directly measured. Conversely, the effect of bend-inducing cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) was large and supports the hypothesis of natural curvature in DNA.",

            "Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity and developing what is known as passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at \u223c2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain\u2019s bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force \u2026",

In 1997, Jarzynski proved an equality relating the irreversible work to the equilibrium free energy difference, \u0394G. This remarkable theoretical result states that it is possible to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters from processes carried out arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We test Jarzynski9s equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the \u0394G profile of the stretching process to withinkBT\/2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching. The implementation and test of Jarzynski9s equality provides the first example of its use as a bridge between the statistical mechanics of equilibrium and \u2026",

Bacteriophage \u03c629 packages its 6.6-\u00b5m long, double-stranded DNA into a 42\u00d7 54 nm capsid 1 by means of a portal complex that hydrolyses ATP 2. This process is remarkable because entropic, electrostatic and bending energies of the DNA must be overcome to package the DNA to near-crystalline density. Here we use optical tweezers to pull on single DNA molecules as they are packaged, thus demonstrating that the portal complex is a force-generating motor. This motor can work against loads of up to 57 pN on average, making it one of the strongest molecular motors reported to date. Movements of over 5 \u00b5m are observed, indicating high processivity. Pauses and slips also occur, particularly at higher forces. We establish the force\u2013velocity relationship of the motor and find that the rate-limiting \u2026",

            "Under appropriate conditions of concentration and ionic strength, ira\/w-bis (Ar-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-diphenylporphine and its copper (II) derivative produce very large, bisignate circular dichroism signals in the Soret region when bound to DNA. The processes leading to these signals are shown to be highly cooperative. A new light-scattering experimental approach is described for detecting such extended aggregates of chromophores in which the radiation used is within an absorption maximum, specifically in the porphyrin Soret absorption region. Results from such resonance light-scattering experiments confirm that extended porphyrin aggregates form on the DNA, which, in contrast, remains dispersed. A model for these interactions consistent with experimental findings involves porphyrin organization into long-range chiral structures having antenna-like properties, that is, forming assemblies in which the electric \u2026",

            "We used a force-measuring laser tweezers apparatus to determine the elastic properties of \u03bb-bacteriophage DNA as a function of ionic strength and in the presence of multivalent cations. The electrostatic contribution to the persistence length P varied as the inverse of the ionic strength in monovalent salt, as predicted by the standard worm-like polyelectrolyte model. However, ionic strength is not always the dominant variable in determining the elastic properties of DNA. Monovalent and multivalent ions have quite different effects even when present at the same ionic strength. Multivalent ions lead to P values as low as 250\u2013300 \u00c5, well below the high-salt \u201cfully neutralized\u201d value of 450\u2013500 \u00c5 characteristic of DNA in monovalent salt.

These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects\u2014features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements 6 and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin 7, 8. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem 9 can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as \u2026",
