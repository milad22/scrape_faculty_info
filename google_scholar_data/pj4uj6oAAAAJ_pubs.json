            "We introduce a method to fabricate high-performance field-effect transistors on the surface of freestanding organic single crystals. The transistors are constructed by laminating a monolithic elastomeric transistor stamp against the surface of a crystal. This method, which eliminates exposure of the fragile organic surface to the hazards of conventional processing, enables fabrication of rubrene transistors with charge carrier mobilities as high as \u223c15 cm2\/V\u00b7s and subthreshold slopes as low as 2nF\u00b7V\/decade\u00b7cm2. Multiple relamination of the transistor stamp against the same crystal does not affect the transistor characteristics; we exploit this reversibility to reveal anisotropic charge transport at the basal plane of rubrene.",

The signatures of this intrinsic transport are the anisotropy of the carrier mobility, \u03bc, and the growth of \u03bc with cooling. Anisotropy of \u03bc vanishes in the activation regime at low temperatures, where the transport is dominated by shallow traps. The deep traps, introduced by x-ray radiation, increase the field-effect threshold without affecting \u03bc, an indication that the filled traps do not scatter polarons.",

We first discuss in detail the technological progress that has made these investigations possible. Particular attention is devoted to the growth and characterization of single crystals of organic materials and to different techniques that have been developed for device fabrication. We then concentrate on the measurements of the electrical characteristics. In most cases, these characteristics are highly reproducible and demonstrate the quality of the single crystal transistors. Particularly noticeable are the small sub\u2010threshold slope, the non\u2010monotonic temperature dependence of the mobility, and its weak dependence on the gate voltage. In the best rubrene transistors, room\u2010temperature values of \u03bc as high as 15 cm2\/Vs have been observed. This \u2026",
