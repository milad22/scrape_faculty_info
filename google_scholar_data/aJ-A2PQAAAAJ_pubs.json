            "Two recent theories are compared quantitatively in order to describe the intervalley mixing effect on donor impurity levels and excitons in many-valley semiconductors. Deep levels are predicted for a screened point-charge potential, regardless of the position at which the potential is centered. Altarelli-Hsu predict that the same potential has a deep level only if centered at an interstitial site. It is shown that this basic discrepancy is a direct consequence of a key Altarelli-Hsu approximation.",

A complete symmetry analysis appropriate for the nonsymmorphic group of cubic ice is given for a simplified model. The band structure of cubic ice is obtained at high-symmetry points and high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. The calculated energy gap of 7.8 eV is in good agreement with experimental data and corresponds to a critical point of type M 0 at k\u2192= 0. The critical points of type M 1 occurring at the point L of the Brillouin zone are interpreted as responsible for the strong peak in the ultraviolet optical constants at 8.7 eV. The broad absorption band at higher energy (\u2245 15 eV) is interpreted as due to transitions from valence bands derived from lone-pair orbitals to the lowest excited bands.",

We use both genuinely isolated slabs and periodically repeated slabs, with different terminations. We report these properties as functions of the thickness and termination of the slabs. The ability to deal with genuinely isolated slabs is a virtue of the localized-basis implementation that we adopt. In particular, the slab surface charge provides a value for the spontaneous polarization in excellent agreement with the calculation of the latter as a Berry phase, and with experiment as well. On the other hand, we find that when periodically repeated slabs are used, the interactions among slabs and the fictitious field imposed by the periodic boundary conditions can significantly affect the accuracy of the calculations, even at quite large vacuum separations.",

All the multipole moments and the electric field are expressed in terms of the applied potential at the electrodes and a matrix which depends on the system configuration. The effective dielectric function is then obtained as an average over the whole sample. For disordered systems, we solve exactly the case of two-particle distributions with short-range correlations and find that the form of the distribution plays a crucial role.

The potential energy in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the free rare-gas atom is parametrized in the simplest form which reproduces the exact experimental excited atomic levels. The same equation is modified to describe the exciton states in the solid phase simply by introducing the effective mass \u03bc and by screening the Coulomb potential outside the atom with the dielectric constant \u03b5 0 of the solid. In this way the exciton levels in the effective-mass approximation become continuously the excited atomic levels, as the effective Rydberg approaches the Rydberg constant. This solves the dilemma between the Wannier and the Frenkel models for all spectroscopic terms, ie, for the high as well as for the low exciton levels. It also solves the problem for the whole series of solid rare gases, in which quite different values of \u03bc and \u03b5 0 occur \u2026",

            "Within the Hartree-Fock (HF) scheme, we investigate some basic polarization features of the paradigmatic ferroelectric perovskite KNbO 3, using a supercell technique. With regard to the spontaneous polarization and the transverse dynamical charge, the HF results are in good agreement with both experiment and density-functional calculations, despite the large difference in the one-electron energy levels calculated with the two methods. On the other hand, the HF value of the electronic dielectric constant \u025b\u221e is substantially lower than experiment, while density-functional values are known to be substantially higher than that.",
