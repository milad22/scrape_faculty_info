            "Seawater intrusion (SI) is a global issue, exacerbated by increasing demands for freshwater in coastal zones and predisposed to the influences of rising sea levels and changing climates. This review presents the state of knowledge in SI research, compares classes of methods for assessing and managing SI, and suggests areas for future research. We subdivide SI research into categories relating to processes, measurement, prediction and management. Considerable research effort spanning more than 50 years has provided an extensive array of field, laboratory and computer-based techniques for SI investigation. Despite this, knowledge gaps exist in SI process understanding, in particular associated with transient SI processes and timeframes, and the characterization and prediction of freshwater\u2013saltwater interfaces over regional scales and in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings.

In this study, a simple conceptual framework is used to provide a first\u2010order assessment of sea water intrusion changes in coastal unconfined aquifers in response to sea\u2010level rise. Two conceptual models are tested: (1) flux\u2010controlled systems, in which ground water discharge to the sea is persistent despite changes in sea level, and (2) head\u2010controlled systems, whereby ground water abstractions or surface features maintain the head condition in the aquifer despite sea\u2010level changes.

            "In certain hydrogeological situations, fluid density variations occur because of changes in the solute or colloidal concentration, temperature, and pressure of the groundwater. These include seawater intrusion, high-level radioactive waste disposal, groundwater contamination, and geothermal energy production. When the density of the invading fluid is greater than that of the ambient one, density-driven free convection can lead to transport of heat and solutes over larger spatial scales and significantly shorter time scales than compared with diffusion alone. Beginning with the work of Lord Rayleigh in 1916, thermal and solute instabilities in homogeneous media have been studied in detail for almost a century. Recently, these theoretical and experimental studies have been applied in the study of groundwater phenomena, where the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy rarely, if ever, apply.

Numerical models are inevitable tools in this undertaking. A wide range of numerical models of different complexity have been developed for this purpose, ranging from simple, lumped parameter models to more complex, physically based models. The foundation of physically based models is the blueprint paper by Freeze and Harlan (1969), and numerous physically based models have been developed following this blueprint. HydroGeoSphere (HGS), the code discussed in this review, is one of them. The origin of HGS is the code FRAC3DVS, developed by R.

If such decoupling is possible, it means that GDP growth is a sustainable societal goal. Here we show that the decoupling concept can be interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and environmental impact. The simple model is compared to historical data and modelled projections to demonstrate that growth in GDP ultimately cannot be decoupled from growth in material and energy use. It is therefore misleading to develop growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is possible. We also note that GDP is increasingly seen as a poor proxy for societal wellbeing. GDP growth is therefore a questionable societal goal. Society can sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of its natural assets, but only by discarding GDP growth as the goal in favor of more comprehensive measures of societal wellbeing.",

If the groundwater table below a stream is sufficiently deep, changes in the groundwater table position effectively do not alter the infiltration rate. This is referred to as a disconnected system. Previous authors noted that a low\u2010conductivity layer below the surface water body is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for disconnection to occur. We develop a precise criterion that allows an assessment of whether surface water\u2013groundwater systems can disconnect or not. We further demonstrate that a disconnected system can be conceptualized by a saturated groundwater mound and the development of a capillary zone above this mound.
