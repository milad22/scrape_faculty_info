            "In this review, recent works related to the selective CO removal in a H2-rich stream for the application of the low-temperature fuel cell are discussed. The membrane separation, the selective CO hydrogenation, and the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) have been generally studied to meet the requirement for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) where the CO concentration should be controlled to be less than 10 ppm not to degrade the electrochemical performance of Pt anode. For the membrane separation, the thin layer of Pd-based alloy metal on the porous ceramic material coupled with the catalytic purification is the most advanced method at present. For PROX catalysts, supported Ru catalysts and Pt-based alloy catalysts have been successfully developed so far. The combination of highly selective PROX catalysts and the CO methanation catalyst can provide the extended temperature range to \u2026",

            "We revealed the first example of a crystalline lithium aluminate nanotube with thermal stability prepared by a surfactant-driven hydrothermal procedure. The obtained nanotube showed an interesting structure unknown thus far for oxide nanotubes such as cylindrical bundles of lithium aluminate subnanotubules. These novel nanotubules had walls of crystalline lithium aluminate with a honeycomblike Al\u2212O wall-network surrounding a central lithium core that forms a linear array of atoms and could be a promising solid ion conducting material.
