The trapping and damping forces were provided by three retroreflected laser beams propagating along orthogonal axes, with a weak magnetic field used to distinguish between the beams. We have trapped as many as 10 7 atoms for 2 min at densities exceeding 10 11 atoms cm\u2212 3.

            "Interference with atomic and molecular matter waves is a rich branch of atomic physics and quantum optics. It started with atom diffraction from crystal surfaces and the separated oscillatory fields technique used in atomic clocks. Atom interferometry is now reaching maturity as a powerful art with many applications in modern science. In this review the basic tools for coherent atom optics are described including diffraction by nanostructures and laser light, three-grating interferometers, and double wells on atom chips. Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories:(i) fundamental quantum science,(ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics. Although some experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates are included, the focus of the review is on linear matter wave optics, ie, phenomena \u2026",

Over 155,000 students initially registered for 6.002 x, which was composed of video lectures, interactive problems, online laboratories, and a discussion forum. As the course ended in June 2012, researchers began to analyze the rich sources of data it generated. This article describes both the first stage of this research, which examined the students\u2019 use of resources by time spent on each, and a second stage that is producing an in-depth picture of who the 6.002 x students were, how their own background and capabilities related to their achievement and persistence, and how their interactions with 6.002 x\u2019s curricular and pedagogical components contributed to their level of success in the course.",

            "Rayleigh scattering off a Bose-Einstein condensate was studied. Exposing an elongated condensate to a single off-resonant laser beam resulted in the observation of highly directional scattering of light and atoms. This collective light scattering is caused by the coherent center-of-mass motion of the atoms in the condensate. A directional beam of recoiling atoms was built up by matter wave amplification.",

The relative phase between the two condensates was determined from the spatial phase of the matter wave interference pattern formed upon releasing the condensates from the separated potential wells. Coherent phase evolution was observed for condensates held separated by 13 \u03bc m for up to 5 ms and was controlled by applying ac Stark shift potentials to either of the two separated condensates.",
