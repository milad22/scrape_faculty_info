Since the barriers have to be thin, each barrier can have only a small temperature difference (\u223c 1 K). Macroscopic cooling is obtained with a multilayer device. The same device is also an efficient generator of electrical power. A complete analytic theory is provided.",

The dominant spin relaxation processes for varying dot size, temperature, and magnetic field are identified. These processes are mediated by the spin-orbit interaction and are described within a generalized effective mass treatment. Particular attention is given to phonon coupling due to interface motion, which dominates the relaxation for dots with diameters\u2272 15 nm, and also to a direct spin-phonon process that arises from valence-conduction band coupling and dominates the rates for increasing temperature. Low-temperature relaxation rates are found to be small and to depend strongly on size, on temperature, and on magnetic field. Results are illustrated with evaluations for GaAs\/Al x Ga 1\u2212 x As systems, and a minimum in the relaxation rate is found for dot diameters\u223c 20 nm.",

The effects of molecular relaxation in the adsorption process are obtained, as well as the adsorption energies and equilibrium distances for several molecular locations and orientations on the surface. We find that all of these benzene derivatives are physisorbed mainly through the interaction of the \u03c0 orbitals of the benzene ring and those of the carbon nanotube. These aromatics do not change significantly the carbon nanotube\u2019s electronic structure, and therefore only small changes in the nanotube\u2019s properties are expected. This suggests that these benzene derivatives are suitable for noncovalent nanotube functionalization and molecule immobilization on \u2026",

The model is successfully applied to explain relevant experimental data for PbTe nanocomposites. A key factor is the grain potential boundary scattering mechanism. Other mechanisms, such as carrier-acoustic phonon, carrier-nonpolar optical phonon, and carrier-ionized impurities scattering are also included. Our calculations reveal that by changing the physical characteristics of the grains, such as potential barrier height, width, and distance between the grains, one can increase the mean energy per carrier in order to obtain an optimum power factor for improved thermoelectric performance. The model can be applied to other nanocomposites by incorporating the appropriate electronic structure parameters.",

Such interactions are important not only for the fundamental science of materials behavior, but also for the design and improvement of micro-and nanostructured devices. In the past decade, many new materials have become available, which has stimulated the need for understanding their dispersive interactions. The field of van der Waals and Casimir forces has experienced an impetus in terms of developing novel theoretical and computational methods to provide new insights into related phenomena. The understanding of such forces has far reaching consequences as it bridges concepts in materials, atomic and molecular physics, condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, chemistry, and biology.

Both single crystals and polycrystalline material were examined. The MIT is accompanied by no change in crystal symmetry and a change in unit-cell volume of less than 0.05%. The resistivity shows little temperature dependence above 226 K, but increases by 3 orders of magnitude as the sample is cooled to 4 K. The specific heat anomaly resembles a mean-field transition and shows no hysteresis or latent heat. Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 orders magnetically at the MIT.

            "The adsorption of adenine, thymine, and their radicals on the surfaces of metallic and semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes are studied by local density approximation within density functional theory. The energies and equilibrium distances for several configurations are obtained after relaxation of the entire system. The changes of the molecular bonds and angles before and after adsorption are also calculated. We find that all molecules are physisorbed due to the interaction of their \u03c0-orbitals and the \u03c0-orbitals of the nanotubes. The electronic structure of both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes is not changed significantly upon adsorption, and thus only small changes in the carbon nanotube properties are expected. The results from these studies can be used as a model of DNA interaction with the surfaces of carbon nanotubes. ",
