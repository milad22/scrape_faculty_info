            "The scattering of x rays and neutrons from rough surfaces is calculated. It is split into specular reflection and diffuse scattering terms. These are calculated in the first Born approximation, and explicit expressions are given for surfaces whose roughness can be described as self-affine over finite length scales. Expressions are also given for scattering from liquid surfaces, where it is shown that \u2018\u2018specular\u2019\u2019reflections only exist by virtue of a finite length cutoff to the mean-square height fluctuations. Expressions are also given for the scattering from randomly oriented surfaces, as studied in a typical small-angle scattering experiment. It is shown how various well-known asymptotic power laws in S (q) are obtained from the above theory. The distorted-wave Born approximation is next used to treat the case where the scattering is large (eg, near the critical angle for total external reflection), and its limits of validity are discussed \u2026",

Bulk superconductivity occurs only in a cubic perovskite phase which exists for x\u2265 0.37 (at 10 K). At room temperature, as the potassium concentration is decreased, the cubic structure distorts first by BiO 6 octahedral tilting and then by symmetric oxygen breathing-mode distortions. Semiconducting behavior for the monoclinic phase at 0\u2264 x\u2264 0.1 can readily be explained on the basis of a commensurate charge-density wave. The semiconducting orthorhombic phase, which extends from the monoclinic phase to the cubic superconducting phase, contains only octahedral tilting distortions that would not be expected to destroy metallic behavior. Thus, this commensurate structure provides no explanation for the metal-insulator transition. An incommensurate \u2026",

From a transmission\u2010electron\u2010microscopy image of an ultrathin section of vycor the material appears to have a homogeneous distribution of mass with no hierarchical organization. The pore interface exhibits a roughness which is probed by both small\u2010angle x\u2010ray scattering and molecular adsorption. The roughness has an upper cutoff of <20 \u00c5 which is not resolved in the transmission\u2010electron\u2010microscopy image and is shown to be unimportant to the dynamics of the direct energy transfer process.
