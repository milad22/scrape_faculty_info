            "Photoelectron counting sequences for single-atom resonance fluorescence are studied. The distribution of waiting times between photoelectric counts is calculated, and its dependence on driving-field intensity and detection efficiency is discussed. The photoelectron-counting distribution is derived from the waiting-time distribution. The relationship between photoelectron counting sequences and photon emission sequences is discussed and used to obtain an expression for the reduced state of the atom during the waiting times between photoelectric counts. The roles of irreversibility and the observer in atomic state reduction are delineated.",

            "The Jaynes\u2013Cummings interaction of a two-level atom with the radiation field is studied when the radiation is initially in a strongly squeezed coherent state. The dynamic response of the atomic inversion shows echoes after each revival when the squeezed coherent state exhibits an oscillatory photon-counting distribution due to the phase-space interference effect. The sensitivity of the dynamic behavior to approximations used in computing the atomic inversion is discussed. Comparison is made with the intensity-dependent interaction model of Buck and Sukumar [ Phys. Lett.81A,  132 ( 1981)]; this model does not exhibit echoes. The mean, variance, and entropy for the photon-number distribution are calculated and found to show behavior similar to that of the atomic inversion.",
