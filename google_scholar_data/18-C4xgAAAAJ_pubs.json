Following the November election, participants living in states that passed a marriage amendment reported significantly more minority stress (ie, exposure to negative media messages and negative conversations, negative amendment-related affect, and LGB activism) and higher levels of psychological distress (negative affect, stress, and depressive symptoms) than participants living in the other states.

Individual differences in student cheating have been studied in relation to multiple demographic factors including age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and school type. Students' school characteristics and the behaviors they exhibit while with their peers at school are common variables of interest in academic cheating research. The student's ability level as reported by test scores or grade point average, as well as self-reported self-efficacy, are frequent correlates of cheating behaviors. Whereas the most frequent finding is that students of lower ability are more likely to report engaging in cheating behaviors, there are also some mixed findings that demonstrate significant levels of cheating behaviors exhibited by \u2026",
