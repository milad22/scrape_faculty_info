            "Nanometer sized silver particles were synthesized by inert gas condensation and co-condensation techniques. Both techniques are based on the evaporation of a metal into an inert atmosphere with the subsequent cooling for the nucleation and growth of the nanoparticles. The antibacterial efficiency of the nanoparticles was investigated by introducing the particles into a media containing Escherichia coli. The antibacterial investigations were performed in solution and on petri dishes. The silver nanoparticles were found to exhibit antibacterial effects at low concentrations. The antibacterial properties were related to the total surface area of the nanoparticles. Smaller particles with a larger surface to volume ratio provided a more efficient means for antibacterial activity. The nanoparticles were found to be completely cytotoxic to E. coli for surface concentrations as low as 8 \u03bcg of Ag\/cm2.",

Moderate manipulation of system parameters of MOCVD can control the particle size. The electro-optical and photocatalytic properties of the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were studied along with several commercially available ultra-fine TiO2 particles (e.g., 3.8\u20135.7 nm). The band gap of the TiO2 crystallines was determined using the transformed diffuse reflectance technique according to the Kubelka\u2013Munk theory. Results showed that the band gap of TiO2 monotonically decreased from 3.239 to 3.173 eV when the particle size decreased from 29 to 17 nm and then increased from 3.173 to 3.289 eV as the particle size decreased from 17 to 3.8 nm.

The maximum band gap reduction was 0.55 eV for 1.5 at.\u200a% Nd-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations using the generalized gradient approximation with the linearized augmented plane wave method were used to interpret the band gap narrowing. The band gap narrowing was primarily attributed to the substitutional Nd3+ ions which introduced electron states into the band gap of TiO2 to form the new lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.",

            "The formation of high-quality thin films of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is important in many applications ranging from material reinforcement to molecular electronics. Laser ablation, a technique widely used to deposit a variety of inorganic materials, can also be used as a simple and highly versatile method for forming thin polymer films. The data presented show that PTFE films can be produced on various supports by the evaporation of a solid PTFE target with a pulsed ultraviolet laser. The composition of the ablation plume suggests that PTFE ablation and subsequent film formation occur by way of a laser-induced pyrolitic decomposition with subsequent repolymerization. The polymer films produced by this method are composed of amorphous and highly crystalline regions, the latter being predominantly in a chain-folded configuration with the molecular axis aligned parallel to the substrate surface.",
