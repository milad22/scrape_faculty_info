            "An interatomic potential for carbon is developed that is based on an empirical tight-binding approach. The model reproduces accurately the energy-versus-volume diagram of carbon polytypes and gives a good description of the phonons and elastic constants for carbon in the diamond and graphite structures. To test the transferability of the model to different environments further, the authors performed molecular-dynamics simulations to study the liquid phase and the properties of small carbon microclusters. The results obtained are in good agreement with those obtained from ab initio calculations.",

            "Silicon is the most important semiconducting material in the microelectronics industry. If current miniaturization trends continue, minimum device features will soon approach the size of atomic clusters. In this size regime, the structure and properties of materials often differ dramatically from those of the bulk. An enormous effort has been devoted to determining the structures of free silicon clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Although progress has been made for Si n with n< 8, theoretical predictions for larger clusters are contradictory 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and none enjoy any compelling experimental support. Here we report geometries calculated for medium-sized silicon clusters using an unbiased global search with a genetic algorithm.

It is observed in the TBMD simulations that two single vacancies coalesce into a 5-8-5 double vacancy at the temperature of 3000 K, and it is further reconstructed into a new defect structure, the 555-777 defect, by the Stone-Wales type transformation at higher temperatures. First principles calculations confirm that the 555-777 defect is energetically much more stable than two separated single vacancies, and the energy of the 555-777 defect is also slightly lower than that of the 5-8-5 double vacancy. In TBMD simulation, it is also found that the four single vacancies reconstruct into two collective 555-777 defects which is the unit for the hexagonal haeckelite structure proposed by Terrones et al.[Phys.

This technique is convenient, as it does not require complicated free-energy calculations for the different phases, but simply allows the system to equilibrate to a co-existence point. By altering the simulation volume and\/or energy, a new coexistence point is found. The calculated method temperature is lower than previous results for the identical model; we suspect that this difference is due to the difficulty of calculating the free energy of the liquid phase, leading to inaccuracies in the previous work. A thorough examination of several different system sizes, from 1024 to 65 536 particles, indicates that the results are only weakly dependent upon the system size.",

In addition to a very good fit to the energy of Si in different bulk crystal structures the model describes very well the elastic constants, defect-formation energies for vacancies and interstitials in crystalline silicon, the melting of Si, and short-range order in liquid silicon.

            "The temperature-dependent thermal conductivity \u03ba (T) of amorphous silicon has been calculated from equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations using the time correlations of the heat flux operator in which anharmonicity is explicitly incorporated. The Stillinger-Weber two-and three-body Si potential and the Wooten-Weaire-Winer a-Si model were utilized. The calculations correctly predict an increasing thermal conductivity at low temperatures (below 400 K). The \u03ba (T), for T> 400 K, is affected by the thermally generated coordination-defect states. Comparisons to both experiment and previous calculations will be described.",

A cluster correlation method is developed to analyze the medium-range order in amorphous systems. We show that the glass systems consist of a stringlike backbone network formed by icosahedral clusters and a liquidlike structure filling in the remaining space. These findings are consistent with those obtained from our independent classical molecular-dynamics studies with embedded-atom method potential for ZrCu system. Such a heterogeneous structure provides a fundamental structural perspective of dynamical heterogeneity and glass formation.",

Additional simulated annealing was also performed for the cluster C 13 which is selected as a prototype of small carbon clusters. In addition to the discovery of structures for Sn and Ge clusters, our simulation results also provide insights into the dynamics of cluster formation.",
