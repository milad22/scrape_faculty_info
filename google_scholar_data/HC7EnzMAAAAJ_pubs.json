            "We discuss the stability and free energy of 1D (chains), 2D (planar superlattices), and 3D (bcc or fcc superlattices) nanocrystals (having hydrocarbons as capping ligands) structures. We start by introducing the method to compute the pressure and free energy. We then analyze the magnitude of many body (or nonadditive) effects, those not described by two body interactions. For 3D superlattices, we examine the relative stability of fcc vs bcc as well as the prevalence of rotator vs crystal phases. We identify a bundling phenomena that occurs during bcc assembly, when next to nearest neighbors begin to make contact. We precisely calculate the density and lattice constant as well as the presence of ligand vortices and find that overall, the simulations fully support the recently introduced Orbifold Topological Model (OTM). By comparing our results with the considerable experimental data available in the literature, we \u2026",

            "The hard sphere diameter dHS of a nanocrystal (or nanoparticle) is a very important parameter that determines the nearest neighbor separation of their assembled structure, even in those situations where the nanocrystals have large deformations of the ligand shell that prevent them from being described as hard spheres. The parameter dHS is a function of the number of grafted ligands and critically depends on the maximum ligand grafting density \u03c3Max, which we calculate by three different methods for the 351 gold nanocrystals with the number of atoms between 38 and 4033. The use of dHS in the interpretation of experimental results is analyzed.",
