DESIGN: Prospective monitoring with retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Single-center academic neurologic intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3-8). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cerebral microdialysis was performed for the initial 7 days after traumatic brain injury. Thirteen patients had microdialysis probes in normal tissue and eight had two probes, one of which was located in pericontusional tissue. Retrospective analysis was performed to determine if microdialysis levels in pericontusional tissue demonstrates higher levels of lactate\/pyruvate ratio than normal tissue and if lactate\/pyruvate ratio increased with reductions in cerebral perfusion pressure. Univariate analysis revealed higher values for glutamate and lactate\/pyruvate ratio in pericontusional tissue compared with normal tissue. However, based on the mixed-effects model analysis, the percent time of elevated lactate\/pyruvate ratio was significantly higher in pericontusional tissue (40+\/-59% vs. 17+\/-37%, p<. 05), and the mean lactate\/pyruvate ratio values showed only a trend relationship (62+\/-134 vs. 34+\/-78, p<. 06). When examined by cerebral perfusion pressure threshold, cerebral perfusion pressure< 60 mm Hg was not associated with higher lactate\/pyruvate ratio values in normal or pericontusional tissue. In addition, no single cerebral perfusion pressure threshold \u2026",

Prospective monitoring with retrospective data analysis. Single-center academic neurointensive care unit. Fifteen patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3-12). None. Hourly cerebral microdialysis was performed for the initial 96 hrs after trauma to determine extracellular levels of glucose, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, and pyruvate in normal appearing frontal lobes. Six months after injury, the anatomical outcome was assessed by measures of global and regional cerebral atrophy using volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging. The lactate\/pyruvate ratio was elevated> 40 after traumatic brain injury in most patients, with a mean percent time of 32+\/-29% of hours monitored. At 6 months after traumatic brain injury, there was a mean frontal lobe atrophy of 12+\/-11% and global brain atrophy of 8.5+\/-4.5%. The percentage of time of elevated lactate\/pyruvate ratio correlated with the extent of frontal lobe brain atrophy (r=-. 56, p< 0.01), but not global brain atrophy (r=-. 31, p= 0.20). The predictive effect of lactate\/pyruvate ratio was independent of patient age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and volume of frontal lobe contusion. Persistent metabolic crisis, as reflected by an elevated lactate\/pyruvate ratio, in normal appearing posttraumatic frontal lobe, is predictive of the degree of tissue atrophy at 6 months.",

Using the frameless stereotactic (CT) guidance, a 4-mm diameter catheter was inserted into the body of the hematoma using a frontal burr hole approach. The catheter was aspirated and then flushed with saline and aspirated to remove unclotted blood. After a confirmatory CT scan to localize the catheter, 1 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was infused into the clot, permitted to bathe the clot for 30 minutes, and then drained into a closed circuit collection system. t-PA was infused every 8 hours for 48 hours.

            "THE MANAGEMENT OF adult hydrocephalus spans a broad range of disorders and ages. Modern management strategies include endoscopic and adjustable cerebrospinal fluid shunt diversionary techniques. The assessment and management of the following clinical conditions are discussed: 1) the adult patient with congenital or childhood-onset hydrocephalus, 2) adult slit ventricle syndrome, 3) multicompartmental hydrocephalus, 4) noncommunicating hydrocephalus, 5) communicating hydrocephalus, 6) normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 7) the shunted patient with headaches. The hydrodynamics of cerebrospinal fluid shunt diversion are discussed in relation to mechanisms of under- and overdrainage conditions. A rationale for the routine implementation of adjustable valves for adult patients with hydrocephalus is provided based on objective clinical and experimental data. For the condition of normal \u2026",
