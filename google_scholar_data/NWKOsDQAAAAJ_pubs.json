The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",

The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4\u03c0 solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|\u03b7| \u2264 5) assuring very good hermeticity.

            "Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles emitted in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV are presented, using data collected with the CMS detector over a broad range of pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and azimuthal angle (\u03d5). Short-range correlations in \u0394\u03b7, which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a simple \u201cindependent cluster\u201d parametrization in order to quantify their strength (cluster size) and their extent in \u03b7 (cluster decay width). Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980 nb\u2212 1 data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate p T of 1\u20133 GeV\/c, 2.0<| \u0394\u03b7|< 4. 8 and \u0394\u03d5\u2248 0.

XENON100 features an ultralow electromagnetic background of (5.3\u00b10.6)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 events\/(keV ee\u00d7 kg\u00d7 day) in the energy region of interest. A blind analysis of 224.6 live days\u00d7 34 kg exposure has yielded no evidence for dark matter interactions. The two candidate events observed in the predefined nuclear recoil energy range of 6.6\u201330.5 keV nr are consistent with the background expectation of (1.0\u00b10.2) events. A profile likelihood analysis using a 6.6\u201343.3 keV nr energy range sets the most stringent limit on the spin-independent elastic weakly interacting massive particle\u2013nucleon scattering cross section for weakly interacting massive particle masses above 8 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 2\u00d7 10\u2212 45 cm 2 at 55 GeV\/c 2 and 90% confidence level.",
