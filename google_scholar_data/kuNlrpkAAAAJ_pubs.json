The biologic premise behind such a strategy is that the tumor-antigen release achieved by localized radiation will promote specific tumor targeting by the adaptive immune system, which can be augmented further by systemic immune-stimulating agents. In this manner, clinicians hope to induce a phenomenon known as the abscopal effect, whereby localized radiation results in immune-mediated tumor regression in disease sites well outside of the radiation field.

Both pathways are critical drivers of tumorigenesis.   Methods Tumor tissues from 504 patients with diverse cancers referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center starting in October 2008 were analyzed for PIK3CA, RAS (KRAS, NRAS), and BRAF mutations using polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing.   Results PIK3CA mutations were found in 54 (11%) of 504 patients tested; KRAS in 69 (19%) of 367; NRAS in 19 (8%) of 225; and BRAF in 31 (9%) of 361 patients. PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in squamous cervical (5\/14, 36%), uterine (7\/28, 25%), breast (6\/29, 21%), and colorectal cancers (18\/105, 17%); KRAS in pancreatic (5\/9, 56%), colorectal (49\/97, 51%), and uterine cancers (3\/20, 15%); NRAS in melanoma (12\/40, 30%), and uterine cancer (2\/11, 18%); BRAF in melanoma (23\/52, 44%), and colorectal cancer (5\/88, 6%).
