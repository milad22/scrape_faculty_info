            "Arsenic contaminations of groundwater in several parts of the world are the results of natural and\/or anthropogenic sources, and have a large impact on human health. Millions of people from different countries rely on groundwater containing As for drinking purposes. This paper reviews removal technologies (oxidation, coagulation flocculation, adsorption, ion exchange and membrane processes) with attention for the drawbacks and limitations of these applied technologies. The technologies suggested and applied for treatment of As rich water have various problems, including the need for further treatment of As containing secondary waste generated from these water treatment processes. More efficient technologies, with a lower tendency to generate waste include the removal of As by membrane distillation or forward osmosis, instead of using pressure driven membrane processes and subsequently reducing \u2026",

            "Montmorillonite-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (Mt-nZVI) has been synthesized to remove inorganic arsenic (As) from aqueous solutions. BET, SEM, EDX, XRD and XPS were used to characterize the clay-supported material which consists mainly of core shell Fe (0) structure with an outer oxide\/hydroxide shell. The dispersion of nZVI onto montmorillonite was found to be increased with decreasing tendency to agglomerate into larger particles. Batch experiments revealed that adsorption kinetics followed pseudo-second order rate equation with high affinity towards both As (III) and As (V) over a wide pH range (4\u20138) which was decreased at pH> 9. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm was found to be 59.9 and 45.5 mg g\u2212 1 for As (III) and As (V) respectively at pH 7.0.

A goal of this paper is to compare and contrast the similarities and differences in arsenic occurrence in West Bengal with those of other parts of the world and assess the unique socio-cultural factors that determine the risks of exposure to arsenic in local groundwater. Successful intervention options are also critically reviewed with emphasis on integrative strategies that ensure safe water to the population, proper nutrition, and effective ways to reduce the transfer of arsenic from soil to crops.

The results of selectrodialysis show that an increase in current density, initial pH of the product, and initial feed concentration of phosphate led to an increase in phosphate concentration in the product. The desalination efficiency from wastewater was 87%, the phosphate concentration in the product can reach 16 mM with a purity of 44%, the current efficiency to transport phosphate and chloride was 26.6% for standard anion exchange membrane and 63% for monovalent selective anion exchange membrane.
