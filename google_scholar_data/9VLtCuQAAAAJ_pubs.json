            "IT is well known that BCS mean-field theory is remarkably successful in describing conventional superconductors. A central concept of BCS theory is the energy gap in the electronic excitation spectrum below the superconducting transition temperature, T c. The gap also serves as the order parameter: quite generally, long-range phase coherence and a non-zero gap go hand-in-hand 1. But in underdoped high-T c superconductors there is considerable evidence that a pseudogap (a suppression of spectral weight) is already formed in the normal state above T c\u2014first, from studies of the spin excitation spectrum 2\u20135, 24, which measure a'spin gap', and later from a variety of other probes 6\u201310. Here we present a study of underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 (Bi2212) using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which directly measures the momentum-resolved electron excitation spectrum of the CuO 2 \u2026",

            "The Fermi surface\u2014the set of points in momentum space describing gapless electronic excitations\u2014is a central concept in the theory of metals. In this context, the normal \u2018metallic\u2019state of the optimally doped high-temperature superconductors is not very unusual: above the superconducting transition temperature, T c, there is evidence for a large Fermi surface 1, 2, 3, despite the absence of well-defined elementary excitations. In contrast, the normal state of underdoped high-temperature superconductors differs in that there is evidence for a \u2018pseudogap\u2019above T c (4\u20137). Here we examine, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the temperature dependence of the Fermi surface in underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4. We find that, on cooling the sample, the pseudogap opens up at different temperatures for different points in momentum space. This leads to an initial breakup of the Fermi surface, at a \u2026",

In conventional metals, these excitations are electrons on the Fermi surface\u2014a contour in momentum (k) space that encloses all of the occupied states for non-interacting electrons. The pseudogap phase in the copper oxide superconductors, however, is a most unusual state of matter 1. It is metallic, but part of its Fermi surface is \u2018gapped out\u2019(refs 2, 3); low-energy electronic excitations occupy disconnected segments known as Fermi arcs 4. Two main interpretations of its origin have been proposed: either the pseudogap is a precursor to superconductivity 5, or it arises from another order competing with superconductivity 6. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that the anisotropy of the pseudogap in k-space and the resulting arcs depend only on the ratio T\/T*(x), where T*(x) is the temperature below which the \u2026",
