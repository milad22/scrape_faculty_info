This long-baseline experiment measures neutrino interactions in Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam with a near detector at Fermilab and again 735 km downstream with a far detector in the Soudan Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota. The two detectors are magnetized steel-scintillator tracking calorimeters. They are designed to be as similar as possible in order to ensure that differences in detector response have minimal impact on the comparisons of event rates, energy spectra and topologies that are essential to MINOS measurements of oscillation parameters.

The nuclear transparency is the ratio of such a cross section in a nucleus to the free pp cross section. The transparency of aluminum increases with incident momentum by more than a factor of 2 from 6 to 9.5 GeV\/c and falls significantly between 9.5 and 12 GeV\/c. This occurs in a region where the free-proton nucleon-absorption cross section exhibits little energy dependence. QCD predicts an increase in transparency with energy.",
