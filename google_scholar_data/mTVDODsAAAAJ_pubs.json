            "Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of superconducting BaFe 1.84 Co 0.16 As 2 reveal a magnetic excitation located at wave vectors (1\/2 1\/2 L) in tetragonal notation. On cooling below T C, a clear resonance peak is observed at this wave vector with an energy of 8.6 (0.5) meV, corresponding to 4.5 (0.3) k B T C. This is in good agreement with the canonical value of 5 k B T C observed in the cuprates. The spectrum shows strong dispersion in the tetragonal plane but very weak dispersion along the c axis, indicating that the magnetic fluctuations are two dimensional in nature. This is in sharp contrast to the anisotropic three dimensional spin excitations seen in the undoped parent compounds.",

The spin dynamics exhibit a gap of 8 meV with anisotropic three-dimensional interactions. Below T C additional intensity appears at an energy of\u223c 4.5 (0.5) meV, similar to previous observations of a spin resonance in other Fe-based superconductors. No further gapping of the spin excitations is observed below T C for energies down to 2 meV.

Neutron scattering 4, 5, 6, 7 and NMR (ref. 8) measurements have already demonstrated a strong correlation between magnetism and superconductivity. A central unanswered question concerns the nature of the normal-state spin fluctuations that may be responsible for the pairing. Here we present inelastic neutron scattering measurements from large single crystals of superconducting and non-superconducting Fe 1+ y Te 1\u2212 x Se x. These measurements indicate a spin fluctuation spectrum dominated by two-dimensional incommensurate excitations extending to energies greater than 250 meV. Most importantly, the spin excitations in Fe 1+ y Te 1\u2212 x Se x have four-fold symmetry about the (1, 0) wavevector (square-lattice (\u03c0, \u03c0) point). Moreover, the excitations are described by the identical \u2026",

Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum\u2010resolved electron energy\u2010loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T\u2010TiSe2. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in \u2026",

We succeeded in suppressing the CDW fully to zero temperature, establishing for the first time the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) at P c= 5.1\u00b10.2 GPa, which is more than 1 GPa beyond the end of the superconducting region. Unexpectedly, at P= 3 GPa we observed a reentrant, weakly first order, incommensurate \u2026",

By comparing measurements on materials across the phase diagram, we put strict upper limits on any possible time-reversal symmetry breaking fields that could be associated with the pseudogap. Comparison between experimental limits and the proposed circulating current states effectively eliminates the possibility that such states exist in this family of materials.",
