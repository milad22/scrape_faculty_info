            "Among 21 different polysaccharides tested, 5 greatly enhanced the spontaneous and cyclic AMP-induced formation of exolipase: glycogen, hyaluronate, laminarin, pectin B, and gum arabic. These polysaccharides have in common the tendency to form highly ordered networks because of the branching or helical arrangement, or both, of their molecules. None of the polysaccharides could be utilized by the cells as the sole carbon source. Strong lipid extraction of four different polysaccharides did not reduce their exolipase-enhancing efficacy. At a constant cell density the stimulation of exolipase formation by various concentrations of glycogen followed saturation kinetics, suggesting a limited number of \"sites\" for the glycogen to act. The active principle present in a solution of pectin was destroyed by degradation (beta-elimination) of the polymer. Hyaluronate lost its exolipase-enhancing activity by exhaustive \u2026",

            "The production of extracellular, thermostable \u03b1-amylase by Bacillus coagulans B49 was studied in solid state fermentation (SSF). Significant levels of amylase were produced in wheat bran moistened with tap water [22 707 (U\/g dry bacterial bran)]\/salt solution (25 692 U). A marked improvement in enzyme production was achieved by optimization of SSF conditions (6700 U). Variations in the phase of \u03b1-amylase production and tires were observed depending on the culture vessels (Flask - 25 000 U at 72 h; reactor - 26 350 U at 48 h) and conditions (static - 24946 U at 72 h; shake flask - 25 263 at 48 h). Maximum enzyme production (26 350 U) was recorded in an aerated reactor. Catabolite repression was not evident in SSF even at high glucose concentrations. Cultivation in large trays yielded an enzyme titre of 17515 U at 96 h.",

The optimum amount of OA required for capping of MN and the amount of bound and unbound\/free OA was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Further, we have studied the effect of water molecules, associated with MN, on the variation in their induction heating ability under alternating current (AC) magnetic field conditions. We have employed a new approach to achieve dispersion of OA functionalized MN (MN-OA) in aqueous medium using sodium carbonate, which improves their biological applicability. Interactions amongst MN, OA and sodium carbonate were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Intracellular localization of MN-OA was studied in mouse fibrosarcoma cells (WEHI-164) by prussian blue staining and confocal \u2026",

Contact angle and interfacial tension measurement tests are the effective ways to identify proper chemicals\/surfactants for enhanced oil recovery by chemical\/surfactant flooding. In the present study a new polymeric surfactant was synthesized from pre-synthesized sodium methyl ester sulfonate (surfactant) and acrylamide for application in chemical enhanced oil recovery. The synthesized surfactant and polymeric surfactant were used to measure interfacial tension between their aqueous phase and crude oil phase to investigate the efficiency of the surfactants in reduction of interfacial tension.
