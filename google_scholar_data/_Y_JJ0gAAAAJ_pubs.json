            "We construct the Lagrangian for an effective theory of highly energetic quarks with energy Q, interacting with collinear and soft gluons. This theory has two low energy scales, the transverse momentum of the collinear particles, p\u22a5, and the scale p\u22a5 2\/Q. The heavy to light currents are matched onto operators in the effective theory at one loop and the renormalization group equations for the corresponding Wilson coefficients are solved. This running is used to sum Sudakov logarithms in inclusive B\u2192 X s \u03b3 and B\u2192 X u l \u03bd decays. We also show that the interactions with collinear gluons preserve the relations for the soft part of the form factors for heavy-to-light decays found by Charles et al.[Phys. Rev. D 60, 014001 (1999)], establishing these relations in the large energy limit of QCD.",

            "The factorization of soft and ultrasoft gluons from collinear particles is shown at the level of operators in an effective field theory. Exclusive hadronic factorization and inclusive partonic factorization follow as special cases. The leading-order Lagrangian is derived using power counting and gauge invariance in the effective theory. Several species of gluons are required, and softer gluons appear as background fields to gluons with harder momenta. Two examples are given: the factorization of soft gluons in B\u2192 D \u03c0 and the soft-collinear convolution for the B\u2192 X s \u03b3 spectrum.",

The main goal of the working group was to present the state of the art of Higgs Physics at the LHC, integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. This report follows the first working group report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002) and the second working group report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002). After the discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC in mid-2012 this report focuses on refined prediction of Standard Model (SM) Higgs phenomenology around the experimentally observed value of 125-126 GeV, refined predictions for heavy SM-like Higgs bosons as well as predictions in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and first steps to go beyond these models. The other main focus is on the extraction of the characteristics and properties of the newly discovered particle such as couplings to SM particles, spin and CP-quantum numbers etc.",
