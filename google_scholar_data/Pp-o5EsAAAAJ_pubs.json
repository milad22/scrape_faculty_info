            "Algorithms that produce classifiers with large margins, such as support vector machines (SVMs), AdaBoost, etc, are receiving more and more attention in the literature. A real application of SVMs for synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR\/ATR) is presented and the result is compared with conventional classifiers. The SVMs are tested for classification both in closed and open sets (recognition). Experimental results showed that SVMs outperform conventional classifiers in target classification. Moreover, SVMs with the Gaussian kernels are able to form a local \"bounded\" decision region around each class that presents better rejection to confusers.",

Methods: Thirty\u2010one participants underwent both ultrasound and MRI testing of 4 muscles: rectus femoris (RF); biceps femoris (BF); tibialis anterior (TA); and medial gastrocnemius (MG). Results: Strong correlations were found between MRI percent fat and muscle EI after correcting for subcutaneous fat thickness (r\u2009=\u20090.91 in RF, r\u2009=\u20090.80 in BF, r\u2009=\u20090.80 in TA, r\u2009=\u20090.76 in MG). Three types of calibration equations were established. Conclusions: Muscle ultrasound is a practical and reproducible method that can be used as an imaging technique for examination of percent intramuscular fat. Future ultrasound studies are needed to establish equations for other muscle groups to enhance its use in both research and \u2026",

A novel algorithm based on Renyi's quadratic entropy is used to train, directly from a data set, linear or nonlinear mappers for entropy maximization or minimization. We provide an intriguing analogy between the computation and an information potential measuring the interactions among the data samples. We also propose two approximations to the Kulback-Leibler divergence based on quadratic distances (Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and Euclidean distance). These distances can still be computed using the information potential. We test the newly proposed distances in blind source separation (unsupervised learning) and in feature extraction for classification (supervised learning). In blind source separation our algorithm is capable of separating instantaneously mixed sources, and for classification the performance of our \u2026",

A hyperthermia system for heating iron oxide nanoparticles was developed by using alternating magnetic fields. Both theoretical simulation and experimental studies were performed to verify the thermotherapy effect. Experimental results showed that the temperature of the tumor center has dramatically elevated from around the room temperature to about 40 o C within the first 5-10 minutes.

Using a double-blind, pretest-posttest control group design, 30 recreationally active, but not endurance-trained, young men were randomly assigned to quercetin and placebo groups.

The advantage of our classifier design is that the input space complexity is decreased with the pose information, which enables fewer features to classify targets with a higher degree of accuracy. Moreover, the training of the classifier can be done discriminantly, which also improves performance and decreases the complexity of the classifier. Three strategies of learning and representation to build the pattern space and discriminant functions are compared: Vapnik\u2019s support vector machine (SVM), a newly developed quadratic mutual information (QMI) cost function for neural networks, and a principal component analysis extended recently with multiresolution (PCA-M).
