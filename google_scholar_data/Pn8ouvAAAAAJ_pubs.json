            "We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay\u2019s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N atoms 3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay\u2019s scheme. A special \u2018\u2018metric\u2019\u2019and a special \u2018\u2018preconditioning\u2019\u2019optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N atoms 2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If \u2026",

It is shown that the total energy functional for US pseudopotentials can be obtained by linearization of two terms in a slightly modified PAW total energy functional. The Hamilton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (H 2, H 2 O, Li 2, N 2, F 2, BF 3, SiF 4) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF 2, Fe, Co, Ni).

            "In this work we derive closed expressions for the head of the frequency-dependent microscopic polarizability matrix in the projector-augmented wave (PAW) methodology. Contrary to previous applications, the longitudinal expression is utilized, resulting in dielectric properties that are largely independent of the applied potentials. The improved accuracy of the present approach is demonstrated by comparing the longitudinal and transversal expressions of the polarizability matrix for a number of cubic semiconductors and one insulator, ie, Si, SiC, AlP, GaAs, and diamond (C), respectively. The methodology is readily extendable to more complicated nonlocal Hamiltonians or to the calculation of the macroscopic dielectric matrix including local field effects in the random phase or density functional approximation, which is demonstrated for the previously mentioned model systems. Furthermore, density functional \u2026",
