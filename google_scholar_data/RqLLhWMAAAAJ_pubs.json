            "Extensive experimental data from high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions were recorded using the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The comprehensive set of measurements from the first three years of RHIC operation includes charged particle multiplicities, transverse energy, yield ratios and spectra of identified hadrons in a wide range of transverse momenta (p T), elliptic flow, two-particle correlations, nonstatistical fluctuations, and suppression of particle production at high p T. The results are examined with an emphasis on implications for the formation of a new state of dense matter. We find that the state of matter created at RHIC cannot be described in terms of ordinary color neutral hadrons.",

We observe a clear particle mass dependence of the shapes of transverse momentum spectra in central collisions below\u223c 2 GeV\u2215 c in p T. Both mean transverse momenta and particle yields per participant pair increase from peripheral to midcentral and saturate at the most central collisions for all particle species.

            "The PHENIX detector is designed to perform a broad study of A\u2013A, p\u2013A, and p\u2013p collisions to investigate nuclear matter under extreme conditions. A wide variety of probes, sensitive to all timescales, are used to study systematic variations with species and energy as well as to measure the spin structure of the nucleon. Designing for the needs of the heavy-ion and polarized-proton programs has produced a detector with unparalleled capabilities. PHENIX measures electron and muon pairs, photons, and hadrons with excellent energy and momentum resolution. The detector consists of a large number of subsystems that are discussed in other papers in this volume. The overall design parameters of the detector are presented.",

            "The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured electrons with 0.3< p T< 9 GeV\/c at midrapidity (| y|< 0.35) from heavy-flavor (charm and bottom) decays in Au+ Au collisions at s NN= 200 GeV. The nuclear modification factor R AA relative to p+ p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+ Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC energies. A large azimuthal anisotropy v 2 with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5< p T< 5 GeV\/c indicating substantial heavy-flavor elliptic flow. Both R AA and v 2 show a p T dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe R AA (p T) and v 2 (p T) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, ie, near a perfect fluid.",
