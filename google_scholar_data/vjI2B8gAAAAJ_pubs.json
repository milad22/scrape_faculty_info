            "A necessary condition for superconductivity (SC) driven by electron correlations is that electron-electron (ee) interactions enhance superconducting pair-pair correlations, relative to the noninteracting limit. We report high-precision numerical calculations of the ground state on four different finite lattices of up to 100 sites within the frustrated two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard Hamiltonian for a wide range of carrier concentration \u03c1 (0< \u03c1< 1). The average long-range pair-pair correlation for each cluster is enhanced by Hubbard U only for \u03c1\u2248 0.5. At all other fillings ee interactions mostly suppress pair correlations. Our work provides a key ingredient to the mechanism of SC in the 2D organic charge-transfer solids and many other unconventional superconductors with frustrated crystal lattices and \u03c1\u2243 0.5.",

Our calculations are for band parameters corresponding to X= Cu [N (CN) 2] Cl and Cu 2 (CN) 3, which are semiconducting antiferromagnetic and quantum spin liquid, respectively, at ambient pressure. We have performed our calculations for variable electron densities \u03c1 per BEDT-TTF molecule, with \u03c1 ranging from 1 to 2. We find that d-wave superconducting pair-pair correlations are enhanced by electron-electron interactions only for a narrow carrier concentration about \u03c1= 1.5, which is precisely the carrier concentration where superconductivity in the charge-transfer solids occurs. Our results indicate that the enhancement in pair-pair correlations is not related to antiferromagnetic order, but to a proximate hidden spin-singlet state that \u2026",

This sequence of transitions can be understood within the 1D Peierls-extended Hubbard (PEH) model. However, in some quasi-1D CTS both transitions occur simultaneously in a direct metal to spin-gapped insulator transition. In this second class of materials the organic stack bond distortion pattern does not follow the pattern of a second dimerization of a dimer lattice. These materials also display charge ordering of a large amplitude below the transition. Using quantum Monte Carlo methods we show that the same PEH model can be used to understand both classes of materials, however, within different parameter regions.

This heuristic method features a fixed shallow quantum circuit depth along the state evolution path. We use this algorithm to determine the binding energy curves of a set of molecules, including H2, H4, H6, LiH, HF, H2O, and BeH2, and find highly accurate results. The required quantum resources of smQITE calculations can be further reduced by adopting the circuit form of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique, such as the unitary coupled cluster ansatz. We demonstrate that smQITE achieves a similar computational accuracy as VQE at the same fixed-circuit ansatz, without requiring a generally complicated high-dimensional nonconvex optimization.

Based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with unitary coupled-cluster Ansatz, we demonstrate that partitioning of the Hilbert space made possible by the point-group symmetry of the molecular systems greatly reduces the number of variational operators by confining the variational search within a subspace. In addition, we found that instead of including all subterms for each excitation operator, a single-term representation suffices to reach required accuracy for various molecules tested, resulting in an additional shortening of the quantum circuit by a factor of 4\u20138. With these strategies, VQE calculations on a noise-free quantum simulator achieve energies within a few meVs of those obtained with the full unitary coupled-cluster Ansatz with single and double excitations for the H 4 \u2026",

The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) approach is applied to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis spin chain model, where it captures the finite-rate quantum quench dynamics to high accuracy. The AVQDS circuits that prepare the quantum states along the dynamical path are shallower than those obtained from naive Trotterization by over an order of magnitude.

            "The objective of this thesis is to reach theoretical understanding of the unusual relationship between charge-ordering and superconductivity in correlated-electron systems. The competition between these broken symmetries and magnetism in the cuprate high temperature superconductors has been extensively discussed, but exists also in many other correlated-electron superconductors, including quasi-two-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids. It has been suggested that the same attractive interaction is responsible for both charge-order and superconductivity. We propose that the specific interaction is the tendency in correlated-electron systems to form spin-singlet bonds, which is strongly enhanced at the commensurate carrier density p of \u00bd a charge carrier per site, characteristic of all superconducting charge-transfer solids. To probe superconductivity driven by electron correlations, a necessary condition is that electron-electron interactions enhance superconducting pair-pair correlations, relative to the non-interacting limit. We have performed state of the art numerical calculations on the two-dimensional Hubbard model on different triangular lattices, as well as other lattices corresponding to K-BEDT-TTF based organic charge transfer solids, for the complete range of carrier densities per site p (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1). We have shown that pair-pair correlation for each cluster is enhanced by electron-electron interaction only for p \u2243 0.5, far away from the density range thought to be important for superconductivity. Although initial focus is on charge-transfer solids, the results of the research will impact the field of correlated electrons as a whole. We \u2026",
