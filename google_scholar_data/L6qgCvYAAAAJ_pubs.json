            "Background The prognostic values of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and TILs subsets in breast cancer (BC) are uncertain.   Methods A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to August 2014) was conducted for studies which met the eligibility criteria. The primary clinical outcome was defined as disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and BC-specific survival (BCSS). Random or fixed-effects model was adopted to estimate the summary hazard ratio (HR).   Results Twenty-five published studies comprising 22,964 patients were reviewed. Pooled analysis indicated that TILs were not prognostic markers for DFS and OS in overall population, but related to improved DFS (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76\u20130.88) and OS (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71\u20130.87) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. For TILs subsets, CD8+ lymphocytes were associated with improved DFS (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56\u20130.84) and BCSS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71\u20130.86) in overall population, while FOXP3+ lymphocytes were associated with reduced DFS (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01\u20132.05) and OS (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.15\u20131.97). In estrogen receptor (ER) negative patients, CD8+ lymphocytes was also related to better BCSS. In addition, the high density of CD20+, CD3+ or low level of PD-1+ or \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes indicated increased OS in limited studies.   Conclusion TILs and TILs subsets are promising prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer, especially in TNBC.",

A recent study reported that lncRNA-UCA1 induced drug resistance in adriamycin chemotherapy. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to adriamycin resistance in cancers remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we performed a genome-wide lncRNA microarray analysis in adriamycin resistant MCF-7\/ADR and parental MCF-7 cells, and revealed differential expression of lncRNAs in distinct category and chromosome distribution patterns. A specific differentially expressed lncRNA (Adriamycin Resistance Associated, termed ARA) was validated in MCF-7\/ADR and HepG2\/ADR cells. ARA is derived from an intron of PAK3 gene, predicted to contain several stable hairpins in secondary structure and has conservative \u2026",

LABC patients treated with preoperative therapy in Cancer Hospital, Fudan University between August 2001 and May 2008 were retrospectively analyzed.

            "Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2, and Ki67 have been increasingly evaluated by core needle biopsy (CNB) and are recommended for classifying breast cancer into molecular subtypes. However, the concordance rate between CNB and open excision biopsy (OEB) has not been well documented. Patients with paired CNB and OEB samples from Oct. 2009 to Feb. 2012 in Ruijin Hospital were included. ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with HER2 IHC 2+ were further examined by FISH. Cutoff value for Ki67 high expression was 14%. Molecular subtypes were constructed as follows: Luminal A, Luminal B, Triple Negative, and HER2 positive. There were 298 invasive breast cancer patients analyzed. Concordance rates for ER, PgR, and HER2 were 93.6%, 85.9%, and 96.3%, respectively. Ki67 expression was slightly higher in OEB than in CNB samples (29.3% vs. 26.8%, P\u2009=\u20090.046). Good agreement (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.658) was demonstrated in evaluating molecular subtypes between CNB and OEB, with a concordance rate of 77.2%. We also used a different Ki67 cutoff value (20%) for determining Luminal A and B subtypes in HR (hormone receptor) +\/HER2- diseases and the overall concordance rate was 79.2%. However, using a cut-point of Ki67 either 14% or 20% for both specimens, there will be about 14% of HR+\/HER2- specimens that are called Luminal A on CNB and Luminal B on OEB. CNB was accurate in determining ER, PgR, and HER2 status as well as non-Luminal molecular subtypes in invasive breast cancer. Ki67 should be retested on OEB samples in HR \u2026",
