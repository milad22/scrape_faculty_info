            "The parent compounds of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors are unusual insulators (so-called Mott insulators). Superconductivity arises when they are \u2018doped\u2019away from stoichiometry 1. For the compound Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x, doping is achieved by adding extra oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (\u2018holes\u2019) into the CuO 2 planes where the superconductivity is believed to originate. Aside from providing the charge carriers, the role of the oxygen dopants is not well understood, nor is it clear how the charge carriers are distributed on the planes. Many models of high-T c superconductivity accordingly assume that the introduced carriers are distributed uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system as in ordinary metals. Here we report the presence of an electronic inhomogeneity in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x, on the basis of observations using \u2026",

            "Granular superconductivity occurs when microscopic superconducting grains are separated by non-superconducting regions; Josephson tunnelling between the grains establishes the macroscopic superconducting state 1. Although crystals of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors are not granular in a structural sense, theory suggests that at low levels of hole doping the holes can become concentrated at certain locations resulting in hole-rich superconducting domains 2, 3, 4, 5. Granular superconductivity arising from tunnelling between such domains would represent a new view of the underdoped copper oxide superconductors. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscope studies of underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 that reveal an apparent segregation of the electronic structure into superconducting domains that are\u223c 3 nm in size (and local energy gap< 50 meV), located \u2026",

Substituting a single impurity atom for a copper atom strongly perturbs the surrounding electronic environment and can therefore be used to probe high-temperature superconductivity at the atomic scale. This has provided the motivation for several experimental 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and theoretical studies 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

At centre stage is the pseudogap phase, which occupies a large portion of the cuprate phase diagram surrounding the superconducting dome 1. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we find that a static, non-dispersive,\u2018checkerboard\u2019-like electronic modulation exists in a broad regime of the cuprate phase diagram and exhibits strong doping dependence. The continuous increase of checkerboard periodicity with hole density strongly suggests that the checkerboard originates from charge-density-wave formation in the antinodal region of the cuprate Fermi surface. These results reveal a coherent picture for static electronic orderings in the cuprates and shed important new light on the nature of the pseudogap phase.",

            "We describe the design and development of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) which can operate at temperatures down to 240 mK and in magnetic fields up to 7 T with high spatial and energy resolution. The compact and rigid STM head is mounted directly on a low vibration, single shot, 3He refrigerator. This refrigerator can be operated at its base temperature continuously for several days before the 3He needs to be recondensed. The system is equipped with a sample transport manipulator from room temperature, and a cleavage device at low temperature, so that the cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum condition inside the cryostat can be utilized. A superconducting magnet provides a magnetic field of up to 7 T at the sample along the STM tip direction. Test results have shown that, at the base temperature, this instrument has better than 0.5 pm z-direction resolution in imaging mode, and better than 20 \u03bcV energy \u2026",

            "The nature and behaviour of electronic states in high-temperature superconductors are the centre of much debate. The pseudogap state, observed above the superconducting transition temperature, T c, is seen by some as a precursor to the superconducting state. Others view it as a competing phase. Recently, this discussion has focused on the number of energy gaps in the system. Some experiments indicate a single energy gap, implying that the pseudogap is a precursor state. Others indicate two, suggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here, we use temperature-dependent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of (Bi 1\u2212 y Pb y) 2 Sr 2 CuO 6+ x to clarify the situation. We find a previously unobserved narrow and homogeneous gap that vanishes near T c, superimposed on the typically observed inhomogeneous and broad gap, which is only weakly temperature dependent. These results not only support \u2026",
