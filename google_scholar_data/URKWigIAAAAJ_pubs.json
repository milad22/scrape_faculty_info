            "Thermoelectric materials interconvert thermal gradients and electric fields for power generation or for refrigeration 1, 2. Thermoelectrics currently find only niche applications because of their limited efficiency, which is measured by the dimensionless parameter ZT\u2014a function of the Seebeck coefficient or thermoelectric power, and of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Maximizing ZT is challenging because optimizing one physical parameter often adversely affects another 3. Several groups have achieved significant improvements in ZT through multi-component nanostructured thermoelectrics 4, 5, 6, such as Bi 2 Te 3\/Sb 2 Te 3 thin-film superlattices, or embedded PbSeTe quantum dot superlattices. Here we report efficient thermoelectric performance from the single-component system of silicon nanowires for cross-sectional areas of 10 nm\u00d7 20 nm and 20 nm\u00d7 20 nm. By varying the nanowire size and impurity \u2026",

            "Controlling the thermal conductivity of a material independently of its electrical conductivity continues to be a goal for researchers working on thermoelectric materials for use in energy applications 1, 2 and in the cooling of integrated circuits 3. In principle, the thermal conductivity \u03ba and the electrical conductivity \u03c3 may be independently optimized in semiconducting nanostructures because different length scales are associated with phonons (which carry heat) and electric charges (which carry current). Phonons are scattered at surfaces and interfaces, so \u03ba generally decreases as the surface-to-volume ratio increases. In contrast, \u03c3 is less sensitive to a decrease in nanostructure size, although at sufficiently small sizes it will degrade through the scattering of charge carriers at interfaces 4. Here, we demonstrate an approach to independently controlling \u03ba based on altering the phonon band structure of a semiconductor \u2026",

In this study, we investigated the possible role of miR-143 in colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:Expression levels of human mature miRNAs were examined using real-time PCR-based expression arrays on paired colorectal carcinomas and adjacent non-cancerous colonic tissues. The downregulation of miR-143 was further evaluated in colon cancer cell lines and in paired CRC and adjacent non-cancerous colonic tissues by qRT\u2013PCR. Potential targets of miR-143 were defined. The functional effect of miR-143 and its targets was investigated in human colon cancer cell lines to confirm miRNA\u2013target association.Results:Both real-time PCR-based expression arrays and qRT\u2013PCR showed that miR-143 was \u2026",

            "Convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a successful algorithm in the region of artificial intelligence and a strong candidate for many computer vision algorithms. But the computation complexity of CNN is much higher than traditional algorithms. With the help of GPU acceleration, CNN-based applications are widely deployed in servers. However, for embedded platforms, CNN-based solutions are still too complex to be applied. Various dedicated hardware designs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been carried out to accelerate CNNs, while few of them explore the whole design flow for both fast deployment and high power efficiency. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art CNN models and CNN-based applications.

            " Open biomass burning is an important source of air pollution in China and globally. Joint observations of air pollution were conducted in five cities (Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Suzhou and Nanjing) of the Yangtze River delta, and a heavy haze episode with visibility 2.9\u20139.8 km was observed from 28 May to 6 June 2011. The contribution of biomass burning was quantified using both ambient monitoring data and the WRF\/CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)) model simulation. It was found that the average and maximum daily PM2.5 concentrations during the episode were 82 and 144 \u03bcgm\u22123, respectively. Weather pattern analysis indicated that stagnation enhanced the accumulation of air pollutants, while the following precipitation event scavenged the pollution. Mixing depth during the stagnant period was 240\u2013399 m. Estimation based on observation data and CMAQ model simulation indicated that biomass open burning contributed 37% of PM2.5, 70% of organic carbon and 61% of elemental carbon. Satellite-detected fire spots, back-trajectory analysis and air quality model simulation were integrated to identify the locations where the biomass was burned and the pollutants transport. The results suggested that the impact of biomass open burning is regional, due to the substantial inter-province transport of air pollutants. PM2.5 exposure level could be reduced 47% for the YRD region if complete biomass burning is forbidden and significant health benefit is expected. These findings could improve the understanding of heavy haze pollution, and suggest the need to ban open \u2026",

            "Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Studies have shown bacterial colonisation after FMT, but data on viral alterations in CDI are scarce. We investigated enteric virome alterations in CDI and the association between viral transfer and clinical outcome in patients with CDI.Ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing of virus-like particle preparations and bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing were performed on stool samples from 24 subjects with CDI and 20 healthy controls. We longitudinally assessed the virome and bacterial microbiome changes in nine CDI subjects treated with FMT and five treated with vancomycin. Enteric virome alterations were assessed in association with treatment response.Subjects with CDI demonstrated a significantly higher abundance of bacteriophage Caudovirales and a lower Caudovirales \u2026",
