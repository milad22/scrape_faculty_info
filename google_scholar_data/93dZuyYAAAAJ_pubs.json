            "Focal adhesions mediate force transfer between ECM-integrin complexes and the cytoskeleton. Although vinculin has been implicated in force transmission, few direct measurements have been made, and there is little mechanistic insight. Using vinculin-null cells expressing vinculin mutants, we demonstrate that vinculin is not required for transmission of adhesive and traction forces but is necessary for myosin contractility-dependent adhesion strength and traction force and for the coupling of cell area and traction force. Adhesion strength and traction forces depend differentially on vinculin head (VH) and tail domains. VH enhances adhesion strength by increasing ECM-bound integrin\u2013talin complexes, independently from interactions with vinculin tail ligands and contractility. A full-length, autoinhibition-deficient mutant (T12) increases adhesion strength compared with VH, implying roles for both vinculin activation \u2026",

            "Cells naturally exist in a dynamic chemical environment, and therefore it is necessary to study cell behaviour under dynamic stimulation conditions in order to understand the signalling transduction pathways regulating the cellular response. However, until recently, experiments looking at the cellular response to chemical stimuli have mainly been performed by adding a stress substance to a population of cells and thus only varying the magnitude of the stress. In this paper we demonstrate an experimental method enabling acquisition of data on the behaviour of single cells upon reversible environmental perturbations, where microfluidics is combined with optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy. The cells are individually selected and positioned in the measurement region on the bottom surface of the microfluidic device using optical tweezers. The optical tweezers thus enable precise control of the cell density \u2026",

In particular, the ability to functionalize and micropattern graphene with proteins is relevant to bioscience applications such as biomolecular sensors, single-cell sensors, and tissue engineering. We report a general strategy for the noncovalent chemical modification of epitaxial graphene for protein immobilization and micropatterning. We show that bifunctional molecule pyrenebutanoic acid-succinimidyl ester (PYR-NHS), composed of the hydrophobic pyrene and the reactive succinimide ester group, binds to graphene noncovalently but irreversibly. We investigate whether the chemical treatment perturbs the electronic band structure of graphene using X-ray photoemission \u2026",

Investigations of the PCM\u2019s architecture and function have been hampered by the difficulty of visualizing this invisible hydrated structure without disrupting its integrity. In this work, we establish several assays to noninvasively measure the ultrastructure of the PCM.
