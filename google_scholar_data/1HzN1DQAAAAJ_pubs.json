As distinct from the approach of Mead and Fairfield (1975), our model incorporates separate mathematical description of the ring current, the magnetotail current sheet and the magnetopause contributions to the total magnetic field. Model formulae for the magnetic field components contain in total 28 input parameters (21 linear coefficients and 7 non-linear parameters) obtained by means of an iterative minimization procedure, which fits the model to the experimental data sets corresponding to different levels of geomagnetic activity, as well as to different conditions in the solar wind.",

The MHD equations are solved by combining a time relaxation numerical technique with a marching\u2010along\u2010radius method. We assume that Alfv\u00e9n waves, propagating outward from the Sun, provide additional heating and acceleration to the flow. Only solutions with waves reproduce the plasma parameters observed in the high\u2010latitude fast solar wind. We show that the meridional distribution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters is dominated by two processes.

            "The global dynamics of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field in June 1991 is simulated based on a fully three-dimensional, time-dependent numerical MHD model. The numerical simulation includes eight transient disturbances associated with the major solar flares of June 1991. The unique features of the present simulation are: (i) the disturbances are originated at the coronal base (1R s) and their propagation through inhomogeneous ambient solar wind is simulated out to 1.5 AU; (ii) as a background for the transients, the global steady-state solar wind structure inferred from the 3-D steady-state model (Usmanov, 1993c) is used. The parameters of the initial pulses are prescribed in terms of the near-Sun shock velocities (as inferred from the metric Type II radio burst observations) relative to the preshock steady-state flow parameters at the flare sites. The computed parameters at the Earth's \u2026",

            "To study the effects of interstellar pickup protons and turbulence on the structure and dynamics of the solar wind, we have developed a fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic solar wind model that treats interstellar pickup protons as a separate fluid and incorporates the transport of turbulence and turbulent heating. The governing system of equations combines the mean-field equations for the solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and pickup protons and the turbulence transport equations for the turbulent energy, normalized cross-helicity, and correlation length. The model equations account for photoionization of interstellar hydrogen atoms and their charge exchange with solar wind protons, energy transfer from pickup protons to solar wind protons, and plasma heating by turbulent dissipation. Separate mass and energy equations are used for the solar wind and pickup protons, though a single momentum \u2026",
