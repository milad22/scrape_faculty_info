            "Phase-matched harmonic conversion of visible laser light into soft x-rays was demonstrated. The recently developed technique of guided-wave frequency conversion was used to upshift light from 800 nanometers to the range from 17 to 32 nanometers. This process increased the coherent x-ray output by factors of 102 to 103 compared to the non\u2013phase-matched case. This source uses a small-scale (sub-millijoule) high repetition-rate laser and will enable a wide variety of new experimental investigations in linear and nonlinear x-ray science.",

The results are consistent with a 12 ps thermal electron-acoustic phonon coupling time together with an instantaneous component from the deformation-potential interaction.

Such pulses have been successfully applied in photoelectron and photoion spectroscopy and recently developed attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study electron dynamics in matter.

            "It is proposed that single attosecond pulses be generated by gating high-order harmonic emission with fields whose ellipticity varies rapidly with time. The laser pulse with a time-dependent ellipticity is created from two 5\u2212 fs laser pulses centered at 750 nm and separated by 5 fs. One of the laser pulses is left-circularly polarized and the other is right-circularly polarized. Numerical simulations show that when neon atoms are driven by such laser pulses, the generated high-order harmonic spectrum in the 25th to the 85th orders are a supercontinuum that corresponds to single attosecond pulses. A simple analytical expression is derived for estimating the high-harmonic radiation time.",
