            "Photocurrent generation in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) relies on the dissociation of excitons into free electrons and holes at donor\/acceptor heterointerfaces. The low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors leads to strong Coulomb interactions between electron\u2013hole pairs that should in principle oppose the generation of free charges. The exact mechanism by which electrons and holes overcome this Coulomb trapping is still unsolved, but increasing evidence points to the critical role of hot charge-transfer (CT) excitons in assisting this process. Here we provide a real-time view of hot CT exciton formation and relaxation using femtosecond nonlinear optical spectroscopies and non-adiabatic mixed quantum mechanics\/molecular mechanics simulations in the phthalocyanine\u2013fullerene model OPV system. For initial excitation on phthalocyanine, hot CT excitons are formed in 10\u2212 13 s, followed by relaxation to \u2026",

            "When collimated beams of low energy ions are used to bombard materials, the surface often develops a periodic pattern or \u201cripple\u201d structure. Different types of patterns are observed to develop under different conditions, with characteristic features that depend on the substrate material, the ion beam parameters, and the processing conditions. Because the patterns develop spontaneously, without applying any external mask or template, their formation is the expression of a dynamic balance among fundamental surface kinetic processes, e.g., erosion of material from the surface, ion-induced defect creation, and defect-mediated evolution of the surface morphology. In recent years, a comprehensive picture of the different kinetic mechanisms that control the different types of patterns that form has begun to emerge. In this article, we provide a review of different mechanisms that have been proposed and how they fit \u2026",

            "Multiple exciton generation (MEG) refers to the creation of two or more electron-hole pairs from the absorption of one photon. Although MEG holds great promise, it has proven challenging to implement, and questions remain about the underlying photo-physical dynamics in nanocrystalline as well as molecular media. Using the model system of pentacene\/fullerene bilayers and femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopies, we directly observed the multiexciton (ME) state ensuing from singlet fission (a molecular manifestation of MEG) in pentacene. The data suggest that the state exists in coherent superposition with the singlet populated by optical excitation. We also found that multiple electron transfer from the ME state to the fullerene occurs on a subpicosecond time scale, which is one order of magnitude faster than that from the triplet exciton state.",

            "One strategy to improve solar-cell efficiency is to generate two excited electrons from just one photon through singlet fission, which is the conversion of a singlet (S 1) into two triplet (T 1) excitons. For efficient singlet fission it is believed that the cumulative energy of the triplet states should be no more than that of S 1. However, molecular analogues that satisfy this energetic requirement do not show appreciable singlet fission, whereas crystalline tetracene displays endothermic singlet fission with near-unity quantum yield. Here we probe singlet fission in tetracene by directly following the intermediate multiexciton (ME) state. The ME state is isoenergetic with 2\u00d7 T 1, but fission is not activated thermally. Rather, an S 1\u21d4 ME superposition formed through a quantum-coherent process allows access to the higher-energy ME. We attribute entropic gain in crystalline tetracene as the driving force for the subsequent decay of S \u2026",

However, this general rule breaks down in a few organic semiconductors, such as pentacene and tetracene, where one photon absorption may result in two electron\u2013hole pairs. This process, where a singlet exciton transforms to two triplet excitons, can have quantum yields as high as 200%. Singlet fission may be useful to solar cell technologies to increase the power conversion efficiency beyond the so-called Shockley-Queisser limit. Through time-resolved two-photon photoemission (TR-2PPE) spectroscopy in crystalline pentacene and tetracene, our lab has recently provided the first spectroscopic signatures in singlet fission of a critical intermediate known as the multiexciton state (also called a correlated triplet pair).

The degree of this kinetic alloy decomposition can be altered by varying the flux of the ion beam. In the high-temperature and low-flux regime, the degree of decomposition scales linearly with the ion flux, but it scales inversely with the ion flux in the low-temperature, high-flux regime.",
