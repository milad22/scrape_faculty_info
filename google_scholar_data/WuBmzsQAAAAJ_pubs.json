            "We construct a cubic field theory which provides all genus amplitudes of the topological A-model for all non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. The topology of a given Feynman diagram encodes the topology of a fixed Calabi-Yau, with Schwinger parameters playing the role of K\u00e4hler classes of the threefold. We interpret this result as an operatorial computation of the amplitudes in the B-model mirror which is the quantum Kodaira-Spencer theory. The only degree of freedom of this theory is an unconventional chiral scalar on a Riemann surface. In this setup we identify the B-branes on the mirror Riemann surface as fermions related to the chiral boson by bosonization.",

We show how one can solve for the amplitudes by using                                     -algebra symmetries which encode the symmetries of holomorphic diffeomorphisms of the Calabi-Yau. In the highly effective fermionic\/brane formulation this leads to a free fermion description of the amplitudes. Furthermore we argue that topological strings on Calabi-Yau geometries provide a unifying picture connecting non-critical (super)strings, integrable hierarchies, and various matrix models. In particular we show how the ordinary matrix model, the double scaling limit of matrix models, and Kontsevich-like matrix model are all related and arise from studying branes in specific local Calabi-Yau three-folds. We also show how an A-model topological string on P1 and local toric threefolds (and in particular the topological vertex) can be realized and solved as B \u2026",

The N = 2A or 2B super-Poincar\u00e9 group in ten dimensions is realized as a global symmetry. In addition the theories have local symmetries consisting of general coordinate invariance of the world-volume, a local fermionic symmetry (called \u201ckappa\u201d), and U(1) gauge invariance. A detailed proof of the kappa symmetry is given that applies to all cases (p = 0, 1, . . . , 9). The second part of the paper presents gauge-fixed versions of these theories. The fields of the IOD (p = 9) gauge-fixed theory are a single Majorana-Weyl spinor A and the U(1) gauge field A\u03bc.

Along the way we clarify the notion of \u201cflat coordinates\u201d for the boundary theory. We also discover an integer IR ambiguity needed to define the quantum theory of D-branes wrapped over non-compact Lagrangian submanifolds. In the large N dual Chern-Simons theory, this ambiguity is mapped to the UV choice of the framing of the knot. In a type IIB dual description involving (p; q) 5-branes, disk instantons of type IIA get mapped to (p; q) string instantons. The M-theory lift of these results lead to computation of superpotential terms generated by M2 brane instantons wrapped over 3-cycles of certain manifolds of G2 holonomy.",

            "Using mirror symmetry, we show that Chern-Simons theory on certain manifolds such as lens spaces reduces to a novel class of hermitean matrix models, where the measure is that of unitary matrix models. We show that this agrees with the more conventional canonical quantization of Chern-Simons theory. Moreover, large-N dualities in this context lead to computation of all genus A-model topological amplitudes on toric Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of matrix integrals. In the context of type-IIA superstring compactifications on these Calabi-Yau manifolds with wrapped D6 branes (which are dual to M-theory on G 2 manifolds) this leads to engineering and solving F-terms for Script N= 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with superpotentials involving certain multi-trace operators.",

This acts on the topological string wave function in a natural way, governed by the quantum mechanics of the phase space H 3(X). We show that, depending on the choice of polarization, the genus g topological string amplitude is either a holomorphic quasi-modular form or an almost holomorphic modular form of weight 0 under \u0393. Moreover, at each genus, certain combinations of genus g amplitudes are both modular and holomorphic. We illustrate this for the local Calabi-Yau manifolds giving rise to Seiberg-Witten gauge theories in four dimensions and local IP 2 and IP 1  \u00d7  IP 1. As a byproduct, we also obtain a simple way of relating the topological string amplitudes near different points in the moduli space, which we \u2026",
