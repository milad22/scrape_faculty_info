            "Existence of the magnetic monopole is compatible with the fundamental laws of nature; however, this elusive particle has yet to be detected experimentally. We show theoretically that an electric charge near a topological surface state induces an image magnetic monopole charge due to the topological magneto-electric effect. The magnetic field generated by the image magnetic monopole may be experimentally measured, and the inverse square law of the field dependence can be determined quantitatively. We propose that this effect can be used to experimentally realize a gas of quantum particles carrying fractional statistics, consisting of the bound states of the electric charge and the image magnetic monopole charge.",

It is shown that the current-driven motion of the crystal reduces the topological Hall effect and the Skyrmion trajectories bend away from the direction of the electric current (the Skyrmion Hall effect). We find a new dissipation mechanism in noncollinear spin textures that can lead to a much faster spin relaxation than Gilbert damping, calculate the dispersion of phonons in the Skyrmion crystal, and discuss the effects of impurity pinning of Skyrmions.",

A recent example is the existence of chiral spin textures, which are observed in magnetic systems lacking inversion symmetry. These chiral spin textures, including domain walls and magnetic skyrmions, are both fundamentally interesting and technologically promising. For example, they can be driven very efficiently by electrical currents, and exhibit many new physical properties determined by their real-space topological characteristics. Depending on the details of the competing interactions, these spin textures exist in different parameter spaces. However, the governing mechanism underlying their physical behaviors remains essentially the same.

It has been argued that a unidirectional (chiral) rotation of a mechanical ratchet is forbidden in thermal equilibrium, but becomes possible in systems out of equilibrium 2. Here we report our finding that a topologically nontrivial spin texture known as a skyrmion\u2014a particle-like object in which spins point in all directions to wrap a sphere 3\u2014constitutes such a ratchet. By means of Lorentz transmission electron microscopy we show that micrometre-sized crystals of skyrmions in thin films of Cu 2 OSeO 3 and MnSi exhibit a unidirectional rotation motion. Our numerical simulations based on a stochastic Landau\u2013Lifshitz\u2013Gilbert equation suggest that this rotation is driven solely by thermal fluctuations in the presence of a temperature gradient, whereas in thermal equilibrium it is forbidden by the Bohr\u2013van Leeuwen \u2026",

Our numerical simulations show that both single and multiple Skyrmions in a crystal move towards the high temperature region, which is contrary to particle diffusion. Noticing a similar effect in the domain wall motion, we employ a theory based on magnon dynamics to explain this counterintuitive phenomenon. Unlike the temperature driven domain wall motion, the Skyrmion\u2019s topological charge plays an important role, and a transverse Skyrmion motion is observed. Our theory turns out to be in agreement with numerical simulations, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our calculation indicates that a very promising Skyrmion dynamic phenomenon can be observed in experiments.",

Subsequently, we explained the reason why it is possible, as recently observed, for an old quasar to be observed in early stages of the Universe. We discuss this question in terms of the evolution of the age parameter as well as in terms of the structure formation. Finally, we give a detailed discussion of the constraints implied by the observed CMB low \u2113 suppression. As a result, the interacting holographic model has been proved to be robust and with reasonable bounds predicts a non-vanishing interaction of dark energy and dark matter.",
