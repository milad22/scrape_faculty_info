This novel SERS assay can detect spectral differences between viruses, viral strains, and viruses with gene deletions in biological media. The method provides rapid diagnostics for detection and characterization of viruses generating reproducible spectra without viral manipulation. ",

These arrays were evaluated as potential surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates using trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene as a reported molecule. SERS activity was shown to depend upon the length of the nanorods. The Ag nanorods with average lengths of 508.29\u00b144.86nm, and having aspect ratios of 5.69\u00b11.49 exhibited the maximum SERS enhancement factors of greater than 108.

Recent developments in oblique angle deposition and other nanofabrication techniques have overcome this limitation, providing an unprecedented opportunity to develop SERS substrates for pathogen biosensor applications. Recently reported examples of SERS's newfound sensing abilities include the capacity to detect low levels of viruses and bacteria, as well as to discriminate between types and strains of pathogens, including pathogens with gene deletions.

In addition to a detailed description of the characteristics of random rough surfaces, Experimental Methods in the Physical Sciences, Volume 37, Characterization of Amorphous and Crystalline Rough Surface-Principles and Applications will focus on the basic principles of real and diffraction techniques for quantitative characterization of the rough surfaces. The book thus includes the latest development on the characterization and measurements of a wide variety of rough surfaces. The complementary nature of the real space and diffraction techniques is fully displayed. Key Features* An accessible description of quantitative characterization of random rough surfaces and growth\/etch fronts* A detailed description of the principles, experimentation, and limitations of advanced real-space imaging techniques (such as atomic force microscopy) and diffraction techniques (such as light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and electron diffraction)* Characterization of a variety of rough surfaces (eg, self-affine, mounded, anisotropic, and two-level surfaces) accompanied by quantitative examples to illustrate the essence of the principles* An insightful description of how rough surfaces are formed* Presentation of the most recent examples of the applications of rough surfaces in various areas",

            "Aligned Ag nanorod arrays have been fabricated on glass substrates using an oblique angle vapor deposition (OAD) method. The surface morphology and structure of the Ag rods were studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Individual nanorods were found to be primarily cylindrical, albeit with irregularly shaped surface protrusions of the rods. The surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) response as a function of nanorod length was investigated using trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene as a probe molecule at an excitation wavelength of 785 nm. The enhancement factors reached a maximum of \u223c5 \u00d7 108 as the nanorod length approached 868 nm and then decreased to \u223c3 \u00d7 106 as the nanorod length increased further to 1900 nm. For the 868 nm nanorod array, signals collected over multiple spots within the same substrate resulted in a relative standard \u2026",
