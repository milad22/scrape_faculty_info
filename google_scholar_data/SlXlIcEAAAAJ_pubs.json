            "We present a compact analytic formula for the two-loop six-particle maximally helicity violating remainder function (equivalently, the two-loop lightlike hexagon Wilson loop) in N= 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of the classical polylogarithm functions Li k with cross ratios of momentum twistor invariants as their arguments. In deriving our formula we rely on results from the theory of motives.",
