            "The fusion of 6 He with a 209 Bi target has been studied at energies near to and below the Coulomb barrier. Despite the weak binding of the valence neutrons in 6 He, little evidence is found for suppression of fusion due to projectile breakup. Instead, a large enhancement of sub-barrier fusion is observed. It is suggested that this enhancement may arise from coupling to positive Q value neutron transfer channels, resulting in \u201cneutron flow\u201d between the projectile and the target.",

By adding an array of 84 Si\ue5f8 CsI (Tl) telescopes the solid-angle coverage of the setup was extended to \u03b8 lab= 16\u00b0. This permitted the complete detection of fragments from the projectile-spectator source. The dominant feature of the systematic set of data is the Z bound universality that is obeyed by the fragment multiplicities and correlations. These observables are invariant with respect to the entrance channel if plotted as a function of Z bound, where Z bound is the sum of the atomic numbers Z i of all projectile fragments with Z i\u2a7e 2. No significant dependence on the bombarding energy nor on the target mass is observed. The dependence of the fragment multiplicity on the projectile mass \u2026",

This interaction incorrectly predicts an O 26 ground state that is bound to two-neutron decay by 1 MeV, leading to a discrepancy between the theoretical calculations and experiment as to the particle stability of O 26.

Over this broad range of incident energies, the mean values and variances of the intermediate mass fragment (IMF: 3\u2a7d Z\u2a7d 20) multiplicity distributions exhibit an approximate scaling with the total charged particle multiplicity. The measured multiplicities of light charged particles and intermediate mass fragments are compared with both a model involving statistical decay of an expanding compound nucleus, and with a model involving microscopic quasi-particle dynamics. The statistical decay model predictions are sensitive to the low-density nuclear equation of state.",

PFASs in grease-resistant food packaging can leach into food and increase dietary exposure. We collected \u223c400 samples of food contact papers, paperboard containers, and beverage containers from fast food restaurants throughout the United States and measured total fluorine using particle-induced \u03b3-ray emission (PIGE) spectroscopy. PIGE can rapidly and inexpensively measure total fluorine in solid-phase samples. We found that 46% of food contact papers and 20% of paperboard samples contained detectable fluorine (>16 nmol\/cm2).

            "As scientists and other professionals from a variety of disciplines, we are concerned about the production and release into the environment of an increasing number of poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) for the following reasons: 1. PFASs are man-made and found everywhere. PFASs are highly persistent, as they contain perfluorinated chains that only degrade very slowly, if at all, under environmental conditions. It is documented that some polyfluorinated chemicals break down to form perfluorinated ones (D\u2019Eon and Mabury 2007). 2. PFASs are found in the indoor and outdoor environments, wildlife, and human tissue and bodily fluids all over the globe. They are emitted via industrial processes and military and firefighting operations (Darwin 2011; Fire Fighting Foam Coalition 2014), and they migrate out of consumer products into air (Shoeib et al. 2011), household dust (Bj\u00f6rklund et al. 2009), food (Begley \u2026",
