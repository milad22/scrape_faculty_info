            "Many marine fishes are cosmopolitan, occurring in continuous (e.g., circumtropical) or discontinuous (e.g., antitropical) distributions. Little is known of the genetic basis of population structure of these species, even though several support extensive fisheries. To develop a database that would facilitate comparison of the population structures among cosmopolitan fishes we consistently included restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a common approach to our investigations of these species. This article presents a review of those analyses. Considerable intra`specific genetic variation was revealed within all cosmopolitan marine species. Continuously distributed species displayed population structures ranging from a lack of significant heterogeneity between ocean samples to shallow but significant structuring within an ocean basin. In general, greater \u2026",

Preliminary studies indicate that a change in terminal gear from J-style hooks to circle hooks may reduce bycatch mortality, but the effects of this change on catch rates of target species are unclear. To evaluate this, we monitored catch composition, catch rates, hooking location, and number of fish alive at haulback during 85 sets in the fall and spring seasonal fisheries from a commercial vessel operating in the western North Atlantic. Circle (size 16\/0, 0\u00b0 offset) and J-style (size 9\/0, 10\u00b0 offset) hooks were deployed in an alternating fashion. Hook\u2013time recorders were used to assess time at hooking and temperature\u2013depth recorders to measure gear behavior.
