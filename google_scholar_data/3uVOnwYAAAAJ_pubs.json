Nevertheless, using specific synthesis methods, molecular units of \u03b1-graphyne (\u2018carbo-benzene\u2019macrocycles) can be inserted between two anilinyl (4-NH 2-C 6 H 4)-anchoring groups that allow these fragments to form molecular junctions between gold electrodes. Here, electrical measurements by the scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) break junction technique and electron transport calculations are carried out on such a carbo-benzene, providing unprecedented single molecule conductance values: 106 nS through a 1.94-nm N\u2013N distance, essentially 10 times the conductance of a shorter nanographenic hexabenzocoronene analogue. Deleting a C 4 edge of the rigid C 18 carbo-benzene circuit results in a flexible \u2018carbo-butadiene \u2026",

            "Controlling charge transport through individual molecules and further understanding the effect of anchoring groups on charge transport are central themes in molecule-based devices. However, in most anchoring effect studies, only two, or at most three nonthiol anchoring groups were studied and compared for a specific system, i.e., using the same core structure. The scarcity of direct comparison data makes it difficult to draw unambiguous conclusions on the anchoring group effect. In this contribution, we focus on the single molecule conductance of porphyrins terminated with a range of anchoring groups: sulfonate (\u2212SO3\u2013), hydroxyl (\u2212OH), nitrile (\u2212CN), amine (\u2212NH2), carboxylic acid (\u2212COOH), benzyl (\u2212C6H6), and pyridyl (\u2212C6H5N).

Quantum interference can play an important role in allowing or forbidding electrons from passing through a system. In this work, the spin-transport properties of a polyacetylene chain bridging zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are studied with nonequilibrium Green\u2019s function calculations performed within the density functional theory framework (NEGF-DFT). ZGNR electrodes have inherent spin polarization along their edges, which causes a splitting between the properties of spin-up and spin-down electrons in these systems. Upon adding an imidazole donor group and a pyridine acceptor group to the polyacetylene chain, this causes destructive interference features in the electron transmission spectrum. Particularly, the donor group causes a large antiresonance \u2026",

The Ca ions are shown to offer the practically significant voltage of \u223c1.0\u20131.25 V, with S substitution giving the highest voltage over Se and Te. We further demonstrate that doubling the capacity of such a battery would also be possible by incorporating a second Ca ion near the Mo6X8 cluster.
