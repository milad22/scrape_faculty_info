            "Certain models with rank-3 tensor degrees of freedom have been shown by Gurau and collaborators to possess a novel large N limit, where g 2 N 3 is held fixed. In this limit the perturbative expansion in the quartic coupling constant, g, is dominated by a special class of \u201cmelon\u201d diagrams. We study \u201cuncolored\u201d models of this type, which contain a single copy of real rank-3 tensor. Its three indices are distinguishable; therefore, the models possess O (N) 3 symmetry with the tensor field transforming in the tri-fundamental representation. Such uncolored models also possess the large N limit dominated by the melon diagrams. The quantum mechanics of a real anticommuting tensor therefore has a similar large N limit to the model recently introduced by Witten as an implementation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which does not require disorder.

However, until now the origin of the magic angles and their irregular pattern have remained a mystery. Here we report on a fundamental continuum model for TBG which features not just the vanishing of the Fermi velocity, but also the perfect flattening of the entire lowest band. When parametrized in terms of \u03b1\u223c 1\/\u03b8, the magic angles recur with a remarkable periodicity of \u0394 \u03b1\u2243 3\/2.

The conformal phase can be studied using large N f methods.
