            "Mitochondrial morphology is determined by a dynamic equilibrium between organelle fusion and fission, but the significance of these processes in vertebrates is unknown. The mitofusins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, have been shown to affect mitochondrial morphology when overexpressed. We find that mice deficient in either Mfn1 or Mfn2 die in midgestation. However, whereas Mfn2 mutant embryos have a specific and severe disruption of the placental trophoblast giant cell layer, Mfn1-deficient giant cells are normal. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn1 or Mfn2 display distinct types of fragmented mitochondria, a phenotype we determine to be due to a severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, we find that Mfn1 and Mfn2 form homotypic and heterotypic complexes and show, by rescue of mutant cells, that the homotypic complexes are functional for fusion. We conclude that Mfn1 and Mfn2 have both redundant and \u2026",

            "High-resolution in vivo imaging of gene expression is not possible in opaque animals by existing techniques. Here we present a new approach for obtaining such images by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using an MRI contrast agent that can indicate reporter gene expression in living animals. We have prepared MRI contrast agents in which the access of water to the first coordination sphere of a chelated paramagnetic ion is blocked with a substrate that can be removed by enzymatic cleavage. Following cleavage, the paramagnetic ion can interact directly with water protons to increase the MR signal. Here, we report an agent where galactopyranose is the blocking group. This group renders the MRI contrast agent sensitive to expression of the commonly used marker gene, \u03b2-galactosidase. To cellular resolution, regions of higher intensity in the MR image correlate with regions expressing marker enzyme \u2026",

We report a highly specific and sensitive optical sensor based on an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor (Q > 108) whispering-gallery microcavity. The silica surface is functionalized to bind the target molecule; binding is detected by a resonant wavelength shift. Single-molecule detection is confirmed by observation of single-molecule binding events that shift the resonant frequency, as well as by the statistics for these shifts over many binding events. These shifts result from a thermo-optic mechanism. Additionally, label-free, single-molecule detection of interleukin-2 was demonstrated in serum.

In response to flow-induced forces, cultured cardiac endothelial cells rearrange their cytoskeletal structure and change their gene expression profiles 1, 2. To link such in vitro data to the intact heart, we performed quantitative in vivo analyses of intracardiac flow forces in zebrafish embryos. Using in vivo imaging, here we show the presence of high-shear, vortical flow at two key stages in the developing heart, and predict flow-induced forces much greater than might have been expected for micro-scale structures at low Reynolds numbers. To test the relevance of these shear forces in vivo, flow was occluded at either the cardiac inflow or outflow tracts, resulting in hearts with an abnormal third chamber, diminished looping and impaired valve formation.

Inhibition of Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) function disrupts convergent extension movements of cells during gastrulation, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear, as cell fates are not affected 1. In Drosophila, Dishevelled controls both cell fate and cell polarity 2, 3, 4, but whether Dishevelled is involved in controlling cell polarity in vertebrate embryos has not been investigated. Here we show, using time-lapse confocal microscopy, that the failure of cells lacking Xdsh function to undergo convergent extension results from defects in cell polarity. Furthermore, Xdsh mutations that inhibit convergent extension correspond to mutations in Drosophila Dishevelled that selectively perturb planar cell polarity. Finally, the localization of Xdsh at the membrane \u2026",

Boundaries between rhombomeres coincide with boundaries of expression of murine regulatory genes 2\u20134. By clonal analysis using intracellular marking, we show here that the rhombomere boundaries are partitions across which cells do not move. When a parent cell is marked before the appearance of rhombomere boundaries, the resulting clone is able to spread into the neighbouring rhombomere. When marked after boundary appearance, the clone still expands freely within the rhombomere of origin, but it is now restricted at the boundaries. Rhombomeres in the chick embryo thus behave like polyclonal units, raising the possibility that they are analogous to the compart-ments of insects.",

Roles have been suggested for target-derived neurotrophins, based both on their expression in target tissues at the time of neuron innervation 2, 3, and on their effects on axonal sprouting 4\u20136. However, direct in vivo evidence of their involvement in axon arborization has remained elusive. We have used in vivo microscopy to follow individual optic axons over time, and have examined the role of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in their development. Here we show that injection of BDNF into the optic tec turn of live Xenopus laevis tadpoles increased the branching and complexity of optic axon terminal arbors. In contrast, injection of specific neutralizing antibodies to BDNF reduced axon arborization and complexity. The onset of these effects was rapid (within 2 hours) and persisted \u2026",

            "A major question in developmental biology is how precursor cells give rise to diverse sets of differentiated cell types. In most systems, it remains unclear whether the precursors can form many or all cell types (multipotent or totipotent), or only a single cell type (predetermined). The question of cell lineage is central to the neural crest because it gives rise to numerous and diverse derivatives including peripheral neurons, glial and Schwann cells, pigment cells, and cartilage. Although the sets of derivatives arising from different populations of neural crest cells have been well-documented 1, 2, relatively little is known about the developmental potentials of individual neural crest cells. We have iontophoretically microinjected the vital dye, lysinated rhodamine dextran (LRD) 3 into individual dorsal neural tube cells to mark unambiguously their descendants. Many of the resulting labelled clones consisted of multiple cell \u2026",
