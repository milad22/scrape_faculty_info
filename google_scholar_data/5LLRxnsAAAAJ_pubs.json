            "Protein chains coil into \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheet structures. Knowing the timescales and mechanism of formation of these basic structural elements is essential for understanding how proteins fold 1. For the past 40 years, \u03b1-helix formation has been extensively investigated in synthetic and natural peptides 2, 3, 4, 5, including by nanosecond kinetic studies 6, 7. In contrast, the mechanism of formation of \u03b2 structures has not been studied experimentally. The minimal \u03b2-structure element is the \u03b2-hairpin, which is also the basic component of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to study the kinetics of folding a \u03b2-hairpin consisting of 16 amino-acid residues. Folding of the hairpin occurs in 6 \u00b5s at room temperature, which is about 30 times slower than the rate of \u03b1-helix formation 6, 7. We have developed a simple statistical mechanical model that provides a structural explanation \u2026",

Optical triggering with nanosecond laser pulses has made it possible to study the fastest-folding proteins as well as fundamental processes in folding for the first time. These include formation of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-sheets, and contacts between residues distant in sequence, as well as overall collapse of the polypeptide chain. Improvements in the time resolution of mixing experiments and the use of dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance methods have also allowed kinetic studies of proteins that fold too fast (\u2273 103 s\u22121) to be observed by conventional methods. Simple statistical mechanical models have been extremely useful in interpreting the experimental results. One of the surprises is that models originally developed for explaining the \u2026",

            "Today there are several different experimental scales for the intrinsic \u03b1\u2010helix as well as \u03b2\u2010strand, propensities of the 20 amino acids obtained from the thermodynamic analysis of various model systems. These scales do not compare well with those extracted from statistical analysis of three\u2010dimensional structure databases. Possible explanations for this could be the limited size of the databases used, the definitions of intrinsic propensities, or the theoretical approach. Here we report a statistical determination of \u03b1\u2010helix and \u03b2\u2010strand propensities derived from the analysis of a database of 279 three\u2010dimensional structures. Contrary to what has been generally done, we have considered a particular residue as in \u03b1\u2010helix or \u03b2\u2010strand conformation by looking only at its dihedral angles (\u03d5\u2013\u03c8 matrices). Neither the identity nor the conformation of the surrounding residues in the amino acid sequence has been taken into \u2026",

            "Theory predicts the existence of barrierless protein folding. Without barriers, folding should be noncooperative and the degree of native structure should be coupled to overall protein stability. We investigated the thermal unfolding of the peripheral subunit binding domain from Escherichia coli9s 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (termed BBL) with a combination of spectroscopic techniques and calorimetry. Each technique probed a different feature of protein structure. BBL has a defined three-dimensional structure at low temperatures. However, each technique showed a distinct unfolding transition. Global analysis with a statistical mechanical model identified BBL as a downhill-folding protein. Because of BBL9s biological function, we propose that downhill folders may be molecular rheostats, in which effects could be modulated by altering the distribution of an ensemble of structures.",

In the accompanying paper the information about the conformational behaviour of helical ppeptides in solution, as well as the studies on \u03b1-helix stability in proteins has been utilised to derive a database of energy interactions. This database, when implemented in an algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR), correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circulara dichroism. The majority of these peptides have been studied at low temperatures (0 to 10\u00b0C), and neutral pH. However,in vivo,proteins fold at higher temperatures and in some cases low or high pH values. To understand protein folding it is necessary to calculate the helical behaviour of linear \u2026",
