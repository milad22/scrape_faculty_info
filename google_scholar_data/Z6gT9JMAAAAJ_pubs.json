            "Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy has been used to study the light-induced bioenergetics in isolated cyanobacterial photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at 77 K. A method was developed to produce optically clear samples at 77 K without the use of cryprotectants, which considerably simplifies the experiments. Relatively intense laser pulses were used for sample excitation. Following 400 nm excitation, predominantly chlorophyll a pigments in PSI with Qy absorption maxima in the 670\u2013685 nm region are excited. This initially excited distribution of pigments transfers energy in~ 400 fs to pigments absorbing near 690 nm, and to pigments absorbing near 715 nm. Further equilibration processes occur and are characterized by a 2.8 ps time constant. Following equilibration, energy trapping and formation of the secondary radical pair state, P700+A1\u2013, occurs with a time constant of 32.5 ps.",
