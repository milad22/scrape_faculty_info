            "The microscopic magnetic properties of the CuO 2 planes in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.63 (T c= 62 K) have been investigated in Cu and O NMR experiments. Unlike the fully oxygenated Y-Ba-Cu-O 7 (T c\u2243 90 K), the various components of the Cu and O Knight-shift tensors show strong but identical temperature dependences in the normal state. This supports the picture that there is only one spin component in the CuO 2 planes. The spin susceptibility deduced from Knight-shift results shows significant reduction with decreasing temperature in the normal state. The temperature dependences of the nuclear-spin-relaxation rates (1\/T 1) are very different for the Cu and the O sites. 1\/(T 1 T) at the O sites is nearly proportional to the spin susceptibility. 1\/(T 1 T) at the Cu sites shows a broad peak around 150 K.

Comparison of the oxygen and copper relaxation reveals a characteristic temperature greater than T c. The copper relaxation rate is enhanced by antiferromagnetic copper spin fluctuations which are undiminished in the superconducting state.

From measurements of Gilbert damping enhancement and inverse spin Hall signals spanning 3 orders of magnitude, we determine the spin Hall angles and interfacial spin mixing conductances for the six metals. The spin Hall angles largely vary as Z 4 (Z: atomic number), corroborating the role of spin-orbit coupling. Amongst the four 5d metals, the variation of the spin Hall angle is dominated by the sensitivity of the d-orbital moment to the d-electron count, confirming theoretical predictions.",

            "The Cu 63 Knight shift in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 has been measured at both Cu (1)(chain) and Cu (2)(plane) sites, using a uniaxially aligned powder. The isotropic part of the spin Knight shift (K s) was found to be positive for both sites, suggesting large transferred hyperfine fields from oxygen p states. The Knight shifts at both sites show significant change below T c, indicating important roles of both the planes and chains in the superconductivity. Despite the uncertainty in the diamagnetic screening, the axial part of K s at Cu (2) sites is found to show linear-T behavior at low temperatures.",

Strikingly, the insertion of a thin NiO layer between YIG and Pt significantly enhances the spin currents driven into Pt, suggesting exceptionally high spin transfer efficiency at both YIG\/NiO and NiO\/Pt interfaces. This offers a powerful platform for studying AF spin pumping and AF dynamics as well as for exploration of spin manipulation in tailored structures comprising metallic and insulating ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and nonmagnetic materials.",
