            "Propolis from stingless bees is well known for its biologic properties; however, few studies have demonstrated these effects. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of propolis from the stingless bee Melipona orbignyi, found in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The chemical composition of the ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) indicated the presence of aromatic acids, phenolic compounds, alcohols, terpenes and sugars. The EEP was active against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the fungus Candida albicans. The EEP showed antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting hemolysis and lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes incubated with an oxidizing agent. Additionally, EEP promoted cytotoxic activity and primarily necrotic death in K562 erythroleukemia cells. Taken together, these results indicate that propolis \u2026",

From 104 rodent blood samples collected (40 Bolomys lasiurus, 52 Holochilus sciureus, 12 Oligoryzomys fornesi, and one Proechimys guyannensis), 21 (20.2%) were antibody-positive (one B. lasiurus, five O. fornesi, and 15 H. sciureus). Hantavirus RNA was amplified by PCR from two O. fornesi and four H. sciureus. Viral sequencing identified two hantavirus genotypes.

We analyzed the influence of long term angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril treatment in normotensive adult Wistar rats fed with standard or palatable hyperlipidic diets. Our results show that long term enalapril treatment decreases absolute food intake, serum leptin concentration and body weight gain. Moreover, in adipose tissue, enalapril treatment led to decreased ACE activity, enhanced the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, adiponectin, hormone-sensitive lipase, fatty acid synthase, catalase and superoxide dismutase resulting in prolonged life span.

The \u03b2-hairpin structure of gomesin with disulfide bridges seemed essential for optimal activity. d-Gomesin was equally active. A membrane-permeabilizing activity was suggested, as gomesin bound to the cell membrane and cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase was detected extracellularly.

Two different issues are presented. The first is the development of a standardized protocol for the acquisition of breast thermal images including the design, construction and installation of mechanical apparatus. The second part is related to the greatest difficulty for the numerical computation of breast temperature profiles that is caused by the uncertainty of the real values of the thermophysical parameters of some tissues. Then, a methodology for estimating thermal properties based on these infrared images is presented. The commercial software FLUENTTM was used for the numerical simulation.
