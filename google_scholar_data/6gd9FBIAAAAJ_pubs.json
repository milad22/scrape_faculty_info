            "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies\u2014a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly\u2014were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of \u2026",

            "The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes, including humans. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the \u223c120-megabase euchromatic portion of theDrosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome encodes \u223c13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegansgenome, but with comparable \u2026",

It produces coherent soft and hard X-rays with peak brightness nearly ten orders of magnitude beyond conventional synchrotron sources and a range of pulse durations from 500 to< 10 fs (10\u2212 15 s). With these beam characteristics this light source is capable of imaging the structure and dynamics of matter at atomic size and timescales. The facility is now operating at X-ray wavelengths from 22 to 1.2 \u00c5 and is presently delivering this high-brilliance beam to a growing array of scientific researchers.

The measurements include cross-sections, forward\u2013backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, m Z and \u0393 Z, and its couplings to fermions, for example the \u03c1 parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured: m Z= 91.1875\u00b10.0021 GeV, \u0393 Z= 2.4952\u00b10.0023 GeV, \u03c1 \u2113= 1.0050\u00b10.0010, sin 2 \u03b8 eff lept= 0.23153\u00b10.00016.
