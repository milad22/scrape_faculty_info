            "The available data on nuclear fusion cross sections important to energy generation in the Sun and other hydrogen-burning stars and to solar neutrino production are summarized and critically evaluated. Recommended values and uncertainties are provided for key cross sections, and a recommended spectrum is given for B 8 solar neutrinos. Opportunities for further increasing the precision of key rates are also discussed, including new facilities, new experimental techniques, and improvements in theory.

            "The 7.65 MeV, J \u03c0= 0+, second excited state in 12 C is known as the Hoyle-state after Fred Hoyle. In the 1950s Hoyle proposed the existence of the state in order to account for the stellar abundance of carbon. Aside from its key role in the synthesis of the elements it is believed to possess a rather unusual structure, where the dominant degrees of freedom are those of \u03b1-particle clusters rather than nucleons. An understanding of the properties of the Hoyle state, for example its radius and excitations, has been the focus of a major experimental activity. Similarly, unravelling precisely why a cluster state should arise at precisely the right energy to promote synthesis of carbon has been a central theoretical challenge. To a significant extent, the Hoyle-state has become a cornerstone for state-of-the-art nuclear theory. This review examines the present status of both theory and experiment and indicates directions \u2026",

Using this, big bang nucleosynthesis calculations predict a primordial 7Li abundance that is a factor of 2\u20133 higher than that observed in Galactic halo dwarf stars. It has been argued that this discrepancy could be resolved if the 7Be(d,\u2009p)2\u03b1 reaction rate were around a factor of 100 larger than has previously been considered. We have now studied this reaction, for the first time at energies appropriate to the big bang environment, at the CYCLONE radioactive\u2010beam facility at Louvain\u2010la\u2010Neuve. The cross section was found to be a factor of 10 smaller than derived from earlier measurements. It is concluded therefore that nuclear uncertainties cannot explain the discrepancy between observed and \u2026",

Measurements were performed for inelastic proton scattering at an incident energy of 200 MeV for targets ranging from 27 Al to 208 Pb. An energy-resolution of 45 keV (FWHM) was achieved by utilizing the faint-beam dispersion-matching technique. A background subtraction procedure was applied and allowed for the extraction of excitation energy spectra with low background. Measurements of the (p, t) reaction at zero degrees for E p= 100 and 200 MeV benefited from the difference in magnetic rigidity between the reaction products and the beam particles, resulting in background-free spectra with an excitation energy-resolution of 32 and 48 keV (FWHM), respectively, and a scattering angle resolution of 0.55\u00b0 \u2026",

            "The 18 F (p, \u03b1) 15 O reaction is recognized to be one of the most important reactions for nova \u03b3-ray astronomy, as it governs the early E<~ 511 keV \u03b3 emission. However, in the nova temperature regime, its rate remains largely uncertain due to unknown low-energy resonance strengths. We report here the measurement of the 2 H (18 F, p) 19 F (\u03b1) 15 N one-nucleon transfer reaction, induced by a 14-MeV 18 F radioactive beam impinging on a CD 2 target; outgoing protons and 15 N (or \u03b1 particles) were detected in coincidence in two silicon strip detectors. A distorted-wave Born approximation analysis of the data resulted in new limits to the contribution of low-energy resonances to the rate of the 18 F (p, \u03b1) 15 O reaction.",
