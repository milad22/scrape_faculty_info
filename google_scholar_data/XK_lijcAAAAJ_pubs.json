            "Comprehensive wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys of the sky have played a key role in astronomy, leading to fundamental new breakthroughs in our understanding of the Solar System; our Milky Way Galaxy and its constituent stars and gas; the nature, properties, and evolution of galaxies; and the universe as a whole. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which started routine operations in 2000 April, has carried out imaging and spectroscopy over roughly 1\/3 of the Celestial Sphere. SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5 m wide-field telescope (Gunn et al. 2006), instrumented with a sequence of sophisticated imagers and spectrographs. The SDSS has gone through a series of stages. SDSS-I (York et al. 2000), which was in operation through 2005, focused on a \u201cLegacy\u201d survey of five-band imaging (using what was at the time the largest camera ever used in optical astronomy; Gunn et al. 1998) and \u2026",

            "It is now 16 years since the first data release from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). This Early Data Release, or EDR, occurred in 2001 June (Stoughton et al. 2002). Since this time, annual data releases from SDSS have become part of the landscape of astronomy, populating databases used by thousands of astronomers worldwide (Raddick et al. 2014a, 2014b), and making the SDSS\u2019s 2.5 mSloan Foundation Telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) one of the most productive observatories in the world (Madrid & Macchetto 2009). This paper describes the 14th public data release from SDSS, or DR14, released on 2017 July 31. The SDSS has completed three phases and is currently in its fourth phase. SDSS-I and-II conducted a Legacy survey of galaxies and quasars (York et al. 2000), the SDSS-II Supernova Survey (Frieman et al. 2008; Sako et al. 2014), and conducted observations of stars for the \u2026",

            "The extragalactic background light (EBL) is of fundamental importance both for understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for \u03b3-ray astronomy, but the overall spectrum of the EBL between 0.1 and 1000 \u03bcm has never been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) observations over a wide redshift range. The evolving, overall spectrum of the EBL is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. This is achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame K-band galaxy luminosity function up to redshift 4, combined with a determination of galaxy-SED-type fractions. These are based on fitting Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) templates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshift range from 0.2 to 1 from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS).

            "Knowledge of the properties of \u03b3-ray bursts has increased substantially following recent detections of counterparts at X-ray, optical and radio wavelengths. But the nature of the underlying physical mechanism that powers these sources remains unclear. In this context, an important question is the total energy in the burst, for which an accurate estimate of the distance is required. Possible host galaxies have been identified for the first two optical counterparts discovered, and a lower limit obtained for the redshift of one of them, indicating that the bursts lie at cosmological distances. A host galaxy of the third optically detected burst has now been identified and its redshift determined to be z= 3.42. When combined with the measured flux of \u03b3-rays from the burst, this large redshift implies an energy of 3\u00d7 10 53 erg in the \u03b3-rays alone, if the emission is isotropic. This is much larger than the energies hitherto considered, and it \u2026",
