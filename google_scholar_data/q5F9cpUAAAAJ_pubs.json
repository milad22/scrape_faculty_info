            "We describe mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase gene in viruses which reactivated in two patients during therapy with \u20102\u2032\u2010deoxy\u2010 3\u2032\u2010thiacytidine, or lamivudine (3TC), and following orthotopic liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B. Virus resistance to 3TC is associated with mutations which lead to amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved tyr\u2010met\u2010asp\u2010asp (YMDD) motif, part of the active site of the polymerase, and which parallel those seen in resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Substitutions of valine and isoleucine for methionine were found in the two cases. The significance of single secondary mutations, which differ between viruses from the two patients, remains to be determined. Thus, viral resistance to lamivudine of hepatitis B virus mimics that of HIV and can occur in the setting of immunosuppression after liver transplantations.",

The company was seeking closer ties involving information sharing and R&D collaboration with suppliers of strategic components. On its part, the supplier wished to move towards the level of co-operation and trust that the two companies had realized in their U.S. operations.

Unfortunately, recurrent infection of the graft can be associated with aggressive disease, and with diminished graft and patient survival. Currently, the role of nucleoside analogues for prevention of graft re-infection is being evaluated. Preliminary results are encouraging, but treatment failure has been associated with emergence of drug-resistant virus.Methods: We have studied ten consecutive patients who received lamivudine prophylaxis for prevention of HBV graft reinfection. Sequential sera, collected prelamivudine then during treatment before and after liver transplantation, were examined. Conventional serological markers were measured, as were serum viral DNA levels with a sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.Results \u2026",
