            "One of the hallmarks of quantum physics is the generation of non-classical quantum states and superpositions, which has been demonstrated in several quantum systems, including ions, solid-state qubits and photons. However, only indirect demonstrations of non-classical states have been achieved in mechanical systems, despite the scientific appeal and technical utility of such a capability 1, 2, including in quantum sensing, computation and communication applications. This is due in part to the highly linear response of most mechanical systems, which makes quantum operations difficult, as well as their characteristically low frequencies, which hinder access to the quantum ground state 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Here we demonstrate full quantum control of the mechanical state of a macroscale mechanical resonator. We strongly couple a surface acoustic-wave 8 resonator to a superconducting qubit, using the qubit to control \u2026",

Individual phonons in a resonant structure can be controlled and detected by superconducting qubits, enabling the coherent generation and measurement of complex stationary phonon states. We report the deterministic emission and capture of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons, enabling the quantum entanglement of two superconducting qubits. Using a 2-millimeter-long acoustic quantum communication channel, equivalent to a 500-nanosecond delay line, we demonstrate the emission and recapture of a phonon by one superconducting qubit, quantum state transfer between two superconducting qubits with a 67% efficiency, and, by partial transfer of a phonon, generation of an entangled Bell pair with a fidelity of 84%.",

Remote entanglement has been realized using a number of different probabilistic schemes 2, 3, but deterministic remote entanglement has only been demonstrated recently, using a variety of superconducting circuit approaches 4, 5, 6. However, the deterministic violation of a Bell inequality 7, a strong measure of quantum correlation, has not been demonstrated so far in a superconducting quantum communication architecture, in part because achieving sufficiently strong correlation requires fast and accurate control of the emission and capture of the entangling photons.

Molecular dynamics simulation is employed for this purpose. In order to improve the data quality, modifications are introduced to the common protocol. As crumpling proceeds, we find that the average storing energy changes from being proportional to one-third of the ridge length to a linear relation, while the ratio of bending and stretching energies decreases from 5 to 2. The discrepancy between previous simulations and experiments on the material-dependence for the power-law exponent is resolved. We further determine the average ridge length to scale as 1\/D 1\/3, the ridge number as D 2\/3, and the average storing energy per unit ridge length as D 0.881 where D denotes the volume density of the crumpled ball.

            "Using the deterministic, on-demand generation of two entangled phonons, we demonstrate a quantum eraser protocol in a phononic interferometer where the which-path information can be heralded during the interference process. Omitting the heralding step yields a clear interference pattern in the interfering half-quanta pathways; including the heralding step suppresses this pattern. If we erase the heralded information after the interference has been measured, the interference pattern is recovered, thereby implementing a delayed-choice quantum erasure. The test is implemented using a closed surface acoustic wave communication channel into which one superconducting qubit can emit itinerant phonons that the same or a second qubit can later recapture. If the first qubit releases only half of a phonon, the system follows a superposition of paths during the phonon propagation: either an itinerant phonon is in the \u2026",

Here, we present a simple and inexpensive flip-chip bonding process, suitable for integrating hybrid quantum devices on chips from different substrates. The process only requires equipment and materials used routinely for contact photolithography, and it is possible to undo the bonding and reuse the chips. The technique requires minimal compressive force, so it is compatible with a wide range of different substrates. Unlike indium-based bonding, this process does not establish a galvanic connection between the two chips, but as we show, in some situations this is not necessary. We demonstrate the technique using lithographically patterned quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, fabricated on one chip, and couple these \u2026",
