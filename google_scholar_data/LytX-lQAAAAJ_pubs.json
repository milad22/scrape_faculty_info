            "We report on the implementation of crystal ion slicing in lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Deep-ion implantation is used to create a buried sacrificial layer in single-crystal c-cut poled wafers of LiNbO3, inducing a large etch selectivity between the sacrificial layer and the rest of the sample. 9-\u03bcm-thick films of excellent quality are separated from the bulk and bonded to silicon and gallium arsenide substrates. These single-crystal films have the same room-temperature dielectric and pyroelectric characteristics, and ferroelectric transition temperature as single-crystal bulk. A stronger high-temperature pyroelectric response is found in the films.",

It is found that the interdefect spacing can be adjusted to yield a flat top response, with close to 100% transmission and 45 Faraday rotation, for film structures as thin as 30 to 35 m. This is better than a three-fold reduction in thickness compared to the best Ce:YIG films for comparable rotations, and may allow a considerable reduction in size in manufactured optical isolators. Transmission bands as wide as 7 nm are predicted, which constitutes a considerable improvement over previously reported bandwidths for magnetic photonic crystals.

            "The miniaturization of optical isolators and their on-chip integration with various optoelectronic devices has been pursued for a number of years. However, reducing the standard paradigmatic construction used in commercial isolators to waveguide form requires stringent fabrication tolerances and special materials that tend to render the process difficult and costly. Thus, novel approaches in device design and materials technology are called for and are being pursued. This paper discusses the application of the Faraday and nonreciprocal phase shift effects in waveguide isolator operation, the complications that arise in the miniaturization of these devices, and the novel solutions being pursued.",
