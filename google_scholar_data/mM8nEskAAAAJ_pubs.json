Collider Physics offers an introduction to the fundamental particles and their interactions at the level of a lecture course for graduate students, with emphasis on the aspects most closely related to colliders--past, present, and future. It includes expectations for new physics associated with Higgs bosons and supersymmetry. This resourceful book shows how to make practical calculations and serves a dual purpose as a textbook and a handbook for collider physics phenomenology.",

Our analysis systematically takes account of theoretical uncertainties in bag factors, decay constants, and quark mixing matrix elements by Monte Carlo sampling. We combine our results to determine the regions in the charged-Higgs-boson parameter space that are consistent with present data. An important result is that the Collider Detector at Fermilab top-quark mass bound m t> 77 GeV can probably not be evaded by \u2026",

            "Gauge singlet extensions of the standard model (SM) scalar sector may help remedy its theoretical and phenomenological shortcomings while solving outstanding problems in cosmology. Depending on the symmetries of the scalar potential, such extensions may provide a viable candidate for the observed relic density of cold dark matter or a strong first order electroweak phase transition needed for electroweak baryogenesis. Using the simplest extension of the SM scalar sector with one real singlet field, we analyze the generic implications of a singlet-extended scalar sector for Higgs boson phenomenology at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider two broad scenarios: one in which the neutral SM Higgs and singlet mix and the other in which no mixing occurs and the singlet can be a dark matter particle. For the first scenario, we analyze constraints from electroweak precision observables and their \u2026",

We evolve the soft-supersymmetry-breaking parameters according to the renormalization group equations (RGE). The minimization of the Higgs potential is conveniently described by means of tadpole diagrams. We present complete one-loop expressions for these minimization conditions, including contributions from the matter and the gauge sectors. We concentrate on the low tan \u03b2 fixed point region (that provides a natural explanation of a large top quark mass) for which we find solutions to the RGE satisfying both experimental bounds and fine-tuning criteria. We also find that the constraint from the consideration of the lightest supersymmetric particle as the dark matter of the Universe is accommodated in much of parameter space where \u2026",

            "The status of the research on muon colliders is discussed and plans are outlined for future theoretical and experimental studies. Besides work on the parameters of a 3\u20134 and 0.5 TeV center-of-mass (COM) energy collider, many studies are now concentrating on a machine near 0.1 TeV (COM) that could be a factory for the s-channel production of Higgs particles. We discuss the research on the various components in such muon colliders, starting from the proton accelerator needed to generate pions from a heavy-Z target and proceeding through the phase rotation and decay (\u03c0\u2192 \u03bc \u03bd \u03bc) channel, muon cooling, acceleration, storage in a collider ring, and the collider detector. We also present theoretical and experimental R&D plans for the next several years that should lead to a better understanding of the design and feasibility issues for all of the components.

We discuss the implications these degeneracies have for detecting CP violation and present criteria for breaking them. A superbeam facility with a baseline at least as long as the distance between Fermilab and Homestake (1290 km) and a narrow band beam with energy tuned so that the measurements are performed at the first oscillation peak can resolve all the ambiguities other than the (\u03b8 23, \u03c0\/2\u2212 \u03b8 23) ambiguity (which can be resolved at a neutrino factory) and a residual (\u03b4, \u03c0\u2212 \u03b4) ambiguity.
