            "We model the rapid (\u223c 1 min) formation of a new electron radiation belt at L\u2243 2.5 that resulted from the Storm Sudden Commencement (SSC) of March 24, 1991 as observed by the CRRES satellite. Guided by the observed electric and magnetic fields, we represent the time\u2010dependent magnetospheric electric field during the SSC by an asymmetric bipolar pulse that is associated with the compression and relaxation of the Earth's magnetic field. We follow the electrons using a relativistic guiding center code. The test\u2010particle simulations show that electrons with energies of a few MeV at L> 6 were energized up to 40 MeV and transported to L\u2243 2.5 during a fraction of their drift period. The energization process conserves the first adiabatic invariant and is enhanced due to resonance of the electron drift motion with the time\u2010varying electric field. Our simulation results, with an initial W\u2212 8 energy flux spectra, reproduce \u2026",

These structures coincide with larger\u2010scale Alfv\u00e9nic waves that carry a large net Poynting flux along magnetic field lines toward the Earth. Both structures are typically observed in the PSBL but have also been observed deeper in the plasma sheet. The small\u2010scale spikes have electric field amplitudes up to 300 mV m\u22121 and associated magnetic field variations between 0.5 and 5 nT. Previous analysis has shown that the larger\u2010scale Alfv\u00e9n waves have periods of \u223c20\u201360 s and carry enough Poynting flux to explain the generation of the most intense auroral structures observed in the Polar Ultraviolet Imager data set.

            "Measurements of the cross polar cap electric potential, by the double probe electric field experiment aboard S3\u20103, from 55 orbits in the dawn\u2010dusk plane are compared with the reconnection electric fields predicted by a variety of models, both theoretical and experimental. The purpose of these comparisons is to understand the extent to which nonreconnection contributions to the polar cap potential must be included, to determine the time response of the polar cap potential to time varying reconnection rates, and to determine the efficiency and saturation levels of the reconnection process. It is found that (1) After several hours of northward interplanetary magnetic field, the cross polar cap potential declines to progressively lower values than those after 1 hour of northward interplanetary magnetic field. This suggests that it requires several hours for the ionospheric polar cap potential to respond to the \u2018turning off\u2019 or \u2026",

            "The Polar satellite carries a system of four wire booms in the spacecraft spin plane and two rigid booms along the spin axis. Each of the booms has a spherical sensor at its tip along with nearby guard and stub surfaces whose potentials relative to that of their sphere are controlled by associated electronics. The potential differences between opposite sphere pairs are measured to yield the three components of the DC to >1 MHz electric field. Spheres can also be operated in a mode in which their collected current is measured to give information on the plasma density and its fluctuations. The scientific studies to be performed by this experiment as well as the mechanical and electrical properties of the detector system are described.",
