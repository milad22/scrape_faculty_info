Microwave radiation is launched at a frequency that approaches a cutoff layer in the plasma and at an angle that is oblique to the cutoff layer. Bragg backscattering occurs near the cutoff layer for fluctuations with k\u22a5\u2248\u22122ki, where ki is the incident probe wave vector at the scattering location.

The process of testing and validating such codes is critical for extrapolation to next-step fusion devices.

When using small \u201cpin\u201d cathodes (\u223c1\u2002mm in diameter) on a medium size pulsed-current generator such as the Cornell Beam Research Accelerator, the central magnetic field approaches 400 T, yielding magnetic pressures larger than 0.5 Mbar.

While Hall physics does not dominate jet dynamics due to the large particle density and flow inside, it strongly impacts flows in the jet periphery where plasma density is low. As a result, Hall physics affects indirectly the geometrical shape of the jet and its density profile. The comparison between experiments and numerical simulations demonstrates that the Hall term enhances the jet density when the plasma current flows away from the jet compared to the case where the plasma current flows towards it.",

The dominant wavelength of the modulation becomes constant late in time. In this work laser shadowgraphy is used to measure the growth of the wavelength and amplitude of the instability as well as the size of the coronal plasma in aluminum wire arrays from the time of plasma formation to the time the wavelength seen late in time is reached.

However, to avoid rapid cooling of the fuel by transfer of heat to the liner an axial magnetic field is required. This field has to be compressed during the implosion since the thermal insulation is more demanding as the compressed DT plasma becomes hotter and its volume smaller. This compression of the magnetic field is driven both by the imploding liner and plasma. To highlight how this magnetic field compression by the plasma and liner evolves we have separately studied Z-pinch implosions generated by gas puff and liner loads. The masses of the gas puff and liner loads were adjusted to match COBRA's current rise times.
