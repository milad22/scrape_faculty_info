As an example, we obtain the one-loop contribution to amplitudes for n-gluon scattering in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the helicity configuration of the Parke-Taylor tree amplitudes. We prove that our N = 4 ansatz is correct using general properties of the relevant one-loop n-point integrals.

We discuss applications to multiloop calculations via the unitarity method. In particular, we illustrate the relations between different contributions to a two-loop four-point QCD amplitude. We also use this identity to reorganize gravity tree amplitudes diagram by diagram, offering new insight into the structure of the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations between gauge and gravity tree amplitudes. This insight leads to similar but novel relations. We expect this to be helpful in higher-loop studies of the ultraviolet properties of gravity theories.",

The amplitude was constructed previously via the unitarity method, in terms of two Feynman loop integrals, one of which has been evaluated already. Here we use the Mellin-Barnes integration technique to evaluate the Laurent expansion of the second integral. Strikingly, the amplitude is expressible, through the finite terms, in terms of the corresponding one-and two-loop amplitudes, which provides strong evidence for a previous conjecture that higher-loop planar N= 4 amplitudes have an iterative structure. The infrared singularities of the amplitude agree with the predictions of Sterman and Tejeda-Yeomans based on resummation.

Once this is imposed, gravity amplitudes are obtained using two copies of gauge-theory diagram numerators. Here we conjecture that this duality persists to all quantum loop orders and can thus be used to obtain multiloop gravity amplitudes easily from gauge-theory ones. As a nontrivial test, we show that the three-loop four-point amplitude of N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory can be arranged into a form satisfying the duality, and by taking double copies of the diagram numerators we obtain the corresponding amplitude of N= 8 supergravity.

We include a simpler form of the previously published amplitudes for e+e\u2212 to four quarks. We obtain the amplitudes using their analytic properties to constrain their form. Systematically eliminating spurious poles from the amplitudes leads to relatively compact results.",

The expression is based on consistency of unitarity cuts and infrared divergences. We expand the integrals around \u03f5= 0, and obtain analytic expressions for the poles from 1\/\u03f5 8 through 1\/\u03f5 4. We give numerical results for the coefficients of the 1\/\u03f5 3 and 1\/\u03f5 2 poles. These results all match the known exponentiated structure of the infrared divergences, at four separate kinematic points. The value of the 1\/\u03f5 2 coefficient allows us to test a conjecture of Eden and Staudacher for the four-loop cusp (soft) anomalous dimension. We find that the conjecture is incorrect, although our numerical results suggest that a simple modification of the expression, flipping the sign of the term containing \u03b6 3 2, may yield the correct answer.
