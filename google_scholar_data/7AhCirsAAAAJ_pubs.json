By entangling the beam\u2019s transverse degrees of freedom with the which-path states of a Sagnac interferometer, it is possible to realize an optical amplifier for polarization independent deflections. The theory for the interferometric weak value amplification method is presented along with the experimental results, which are in good agreement. Of particular interest, we measured the angular deflection of a mirror down to 400\u00b1200 frad and the linear travel of a piezo actuator down to 14\u00b17 fm.",

            "Since its introduction 25 years ago, the quantum weak value has gradually transitioned from a theoretical curiosity to a practical laboratory tool. While its utility is apparent in the recent explosion of weak value experiments, its interpretation has historically been a subject of confusion. Here a pragmatic introduction to the weak value in terms of measurable quantities is presented, along with an explanation for how it can be determined in the laboratory. Further, its application to three distinct experimental techniques is reviewed. First, as a large interaction parameter it can amplify small signals above technical background noise. Second, as a measurable complex value it enables novel techniques for direct quantum state and geometric phase determination. Third, as a conditioned average of generalized observable eigenvalues it provides a measurable window into nonclassical features of quantum mechanics. In this \u2026",

The undoing procedure has only a finite probability of success because of the nonunitary nature of quantum measurement, though it is accompanied by a clear experimental indication of whether or not the undoing has been successful. The probability of success decreases with increasing strength of the measurement, reaching zero for a traditional projective measurement. Measurement undoing (\u201cquantum undemolition\u201d) may be interpreted as a kind of quantum eraser, in which the information obtained from the first measurement is erased by the second measurement, which is an essential part of the undoing procedure.

This method has the advantage of reduced technical noise and allows for the use of detectors with a low saturation intensity.

Using the Fisher-information metric, we demonstrate that weak-value techniques can put all of the Fisher information about the detected parameter into a small portion of the events and show how this fact alone gives technical advantages. We go on to consider a time-correlated noise model and find that a Fisher-information analysis indicates that the standard method can have much larger information about the detected parameter than the postselected technique.
