We observe that the lattice transforms from hexagonal to nearly square over the field range of 0\u20134 T for fields applied along the [001] direction. Above\u2248 0.75 T, we find that the lattice orientation is strongly linked to the symmetry of the underlying V 3 Si crystal and has a (100) symmetry plane. Near the rhombus-to-square transition at 4 T, we observe anisotropic long-range translational order, consistent with predictions of the elasticity of the lattice near this transition.",

This width is consistent with that determined from the distribution of oxygen on a Cu(001) crystal after an O+ ion beam deposition, measured using Auger electron spectroscopy.

Electrical conductance of a crater \u03c3 c (Q) increased by 4 orders of magnitude (7.9\u00d7 10\u2212 4 \u03bc S to 6.1 \u03bc S) as Q increased, corresponding to crater depths ranging from 2 to 11 \u00c5. By employing a heated spike model, we determine that the energy required to produce the craters spans from 8 to 25 keV over the investigated charge states.

The specific design requirements for this modified instrument were chosen to enable the exposure of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device to monoenergtic, well-collimated beams of alkali ions while monitoring both the scattered beam flux and the device characteristics. Our goal is to explore the role that hot electrons injected toward the MOS device surface play in the neutralization of scattered ions. To illustrate the functionality of our system, we present energy-resolved spectra for Na+, K+, and Cs+ ions scattered from the surface of a Ag(001) single crystal for a range of incident energies. In addition, we show MOS device current-voltage characteristics measured in situ in a new rapid-turnaround load lock and sample translation stage.",

Scattering geometries were chosen that simplify the selection of single collisions between the incident ions and surface atoms and consequently also simplify the identification of the charge transfer mechanisms occurring in the O-Cu system. It was found that the ratio of O+ to O\u2212 ions is independent of the incident ion charge state, demonstrating that memory loss occurs over the entire range of energies and scattering geometries investigated. From general arguments based on the energies of the electronic states of the O-Cu system, we attribute the formation of scattered O\u2212 ions and neutral O atoms to a resonant charge transfer process. Evidence is presented that the formation of O+ ions is due to a hard collision between the incident ions and top layer surface atoms. Similar \u2026",
