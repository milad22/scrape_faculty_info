Optical measurements, including reflection-mode optical microscopy and transmission and single-domain reflection spectroscopy, reveal that the periodic arrays exhibit a photonic band gap in the (1 1 1) direction of the fcc lattice, and calculations are presented to estimate the effective value of the refractive index of the colloidal spheres. Finally, photoluminescence (PL) measurements show that the ZnO lasing thresholds are lower in periodic structures than in random arrays of identical spheres.",

The interference of scattered light, which is weak in the passive systems, is greatly enhanced in the presence of high gain, providing coherent and resonant feedback for lasing. The lasing modes are confined in the vicinity of the pumped volume due to absorption of emitted light outside it. In the ballistic regime where the size of the gain volume is less than the scattering mean free path, lasing oscillation occurs along the direction in which the gain volume is most extended, producing directional laser output. The feedback for lasing originates mainly from backscattering of particles near the boundaries of the pumped region. It results in nearly constant frequency spacing of lasing modes, which scales inversely with the maximum dimension of the gain volume.",

The ratio of the sphere diameter to the lasing wavelength was varied in a wide range, which covered the transition from the weak Rayleigh scattering regime to the strong Mie scattering regime. Experimentally, when the diameters of monodispersed ZnO spherical particles changed from less than 100 to more than 600 nm we observed a drastic decrease of the lasing threshold at small-particle size followed by a plateau at large particle size. We attribute this effect to the particle-size dependence of transport mean free path l_t, which was deduced from coherent backscattering measurements. Theoretical calculation of l_t reproduced experimental behavior. Using the finite-difference time domain method, we obtained the lasing threshold and its standard \u2026",

The photonic crystals are inverse opals with high refractive index contrast that simultaneously confine light and provide optical gain. Highly directional lasing with tunable wavelength is obtained by optical pumping. Comparison of the experimental results to the calculated band structure shows that lasing occurs in high-order bands with abnormally low group velocity. This demonstrates that the high-order band structure of three-dimensional photonic crystals can be used to effectively confine light and enhance emission.

Light scattering, which had been regarded detrimental to lasing action for a long time, actually provided coherent feedback for lasing. We also trapped laser light in micrometer-sized random media. The trapping was caused by disorder-induced scattering and interference. This nontraditional way of light confinement has important application to microlasers. The threshold of random laser can be reduced by incorporating some degree of order into an active random medium. Our calculation result shows that by optimizing the degree of order one can dramatically reduce the threshold of random laser to the values comparable to htose of photonic bandgap defect lasers.",

            "We present direct experimental evidence for position-dependent diffusion in open random media. The interference of light in time-reversed paths results in renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which varies spatially. To probe the wave transport inside the system, we fabricate two-dimensional disordered waveguides and monitor the light intensity from the third dimension. Change the geometry of the system or dissipation limits the size of the loop trajectories, allowing us to control the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient. This work shows the possibility of manipulating wave diffusion via the interplay of localization and dissipation.",
