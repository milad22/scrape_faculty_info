            "The current understanding of astrophysical magnetic fields is reviewed, focusing on their generation and maintenance by turbulence. In the astrophysical context this generation is usually explained by a self-excited dynamo, which involves flows that can amplify a weak \u2018seed\u2019 magnetic field exponentially fast. Particular emphasis is placed on the nonlinear saturation of the dynamo. Analytic and numerical results are discussed both for small scale dynamos, which are completely isotropic, and for large scale dynamos, where some form of parity breaking is crucial. Central to the discussion of large scale dynamos is the so-called alpha effect which explains the generation of a mean field if the turbulence lacks mirror symmetry, i.e. if the flow has kinetic helicity. Large scale dynamos produce small scale helical fields as a waste product that quench the large scale dynamo and hence the alpha effect. With this in mind, the \u2026",

Among other topics, we consider the enhancement of global magnetic fields in the interarm regions, magnetic spiral arms, and representations as superpositions of azimuthal modes, emphasizing a number of unresolved questions. It is argued that a turbulent hydromagnetic dynamo of some kind and an inverse cascade of magnetic energy gives the most plausible explanation for the regular galactic magnetic fields. Primordial theory is found to be unsatisfactory, and fields of cosmological origin may not even be able to provide a seed field for a dynamo. Although dynamo theory has its own problems, the general form of the dynamo equations appears quite robust.

Supersonic flows are initially generated by the Balbus-Hawley magnetic shear instability. The resulting flows regenerate a turbulent magnetic field which, in turn, reinforces the turbulence. Thus, the system acts like a dynamo that generates its own turbulence. However, unlike usual dynamos, the magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy of the turbulence by a factor of 3-10. By assuming the field to be vertical on the outer (upper and lower) surfaces we do not constrain the horizontal magnetic flux. Indeed, a large-scale toroidal magnetic field is generated, mostly in the form of toroidal flux tubes with lengths comparable to the toroidal extent of the box. This large-scale field is mainly of even (ie, quadrupolar) parity with respect to the midplane and \u2026",

The resulting flow, which is essentially the prototype of the \u03b12 dynamo of mean field dynamo theory, produces strong dynamo action with an additional large\u2010scale field on the scale of the box (at wavenumber  ; forcing is at  ). This large\u2010scale field is nearly force free and exceeds the equipartition value. As the magnetic Reynolds number Rm increases, the saturation field strength and the growth rate of the dynamo increase. However, the time it takes to build up the large\u2010scale field from equipartition to its final superequipartition value increases with magnetic Reynolds number. The large\u2010scale field generation can be identified as being due to nonlocal interactions originating from the forcing scale, which is characteristic of the \u03b1\u2010effect.

            "We investigate hydromagnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding universe. We present the basic, covariant MHD equations, find solutions for MHD waves in the early universe, and investigate the equations numerically for random magnetic fields in two spatial dimensions. We find the formation of magnetic structures at larger and larger scales as time goes on. In three dimensions we use a cascade (shell) model that has been rather successful in the study of certain aspects of hydrodynamic turbulence. Using such a model we find that after\u223c 10 9 times the initial time the scale of the magnetic field fluctuation (in the comoving frame) has increased by 4-5 orders of magnitude as a consequence of an inverse cascade effect (ie, transfer of energy from smaller to larger scales). Thus at large scales primordial magnetic fields are considerably stronger than \u2026",

            "We use three-dimensional simulations to study compressible convection in a rotating frame with magnetic elds and overshoot into surrounding stable layers. The, initially weak, magnetic eld is ampli ed and maintained by dynamo action and becomes organised into ux tubes that are wrapped around vortex tubes. We also observe vortex buoyancy which causes upward ows in the cores of extended downdrafts. An analysis of the angles between various vector elds shows that there is a tendency for the magnetic eld to be parallel or antiparallel to the vorticity vector, especially when the magnetic eld is strong. The magnetic energy spectrum has a short inertial range with a slope compatible with k+ 1= 3 during the early growth phase of the dynamo. During the saturated state the slope is compatible with k? 1. A simple analysis based on various characteristic timescales and energy transfer rates highlights important qualitative ideas regarding the energy budget of hydromagnetic dynamos.",
