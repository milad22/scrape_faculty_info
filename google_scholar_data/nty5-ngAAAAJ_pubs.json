            "The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication, and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviours 1. Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive development, which can range from above average to intellectual disability 2. Although ASDs are known to be highly heritable (\u223c 90%) 3, the underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown. Here we analysed the genome-wide characteristics of rare (< 1% frequency) copy number variation in ASD using dense genotyping arrays. When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1,287 matched controls, cases were found to carry a higher global burden of rare, genic copy number variants (CNVs)(1.19 fold, P= 0.012), especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and\/or intellectual disability (1.69 fold, P= 3.4\u00d7 10-4).

            "Most psychiatric disorders are moderately to highly heritable. The degree to which genetic variation is unique to individual disorders or shared across disorders is unclear. To examine shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17\u201329% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68\u00b10.04 se), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43\u00b10.06 se), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47\u00b10.06 se), and ADHD \u2026",

Linkage and copy number variation analyses implicate chromosome 11p12\u2013p13 and neurexins, respectively, among other candidate loci.

Chinese hamster ovary CHO\u2010K1 cell lines expressing D4 receptor variants displayed pharmacological profiles that were in close agreement with previous data from transiently expressed D4 receptors in COS\u20107 cells. Dopamine stimulation of the D4 receptors resulted in a concentration\u2010dependent inhibition of the forskolin\u2010stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. The potency of dopamine to inhibit cAMP formation was about twofold reduced for D4.7 (EC50 of \u223c37 nM) compared with the D4.2 and D4.4 variants (EC50 of \u223c16 nM).

We analyzed 2,446 ASD-affected families and confirmed an excess of genic deletions and duplications in affected versus control groups (1.41-fold, p = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125) and an increase in affected subjects carrying exonic pathogenic CNVs overlapping known loci associated with dominant or X-linked ASD and intellectual disability (odds ratio = 12.62, p = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221215, \u223c3% of ASD subjects). Pathogenic CNVs, often showing variable expressivity, included rare de novo and inherited events at 36 loci, implicating ASD-associated genes (CHD2, HDAC4, and GDI1) previously linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as other genes such as SETD5, MIR137, and HDAC9. Consistent with hypothesized gender-specific modulators, females with ASD were more likely to have highly penetrant CNVs (p = 0.017) and \u2026",
