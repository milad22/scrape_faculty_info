            "The transition from care into adulthood is a difficult step for any young person, but young people leaving care have a high risk of social exclusion, both in terms of material disadvantage and marginalisation. In Young People's Transitions from Care to Adulthood leading academics gather together the latest international research relating to the transition of young people leaving care, outlining and comparing the range of legal and policy frameworks, welfare regimes and innovative practice across 16 countries. The book also highlights the variations that exist between different groups leaving care. Featuring key messages for policy and practice, this book will give academics, practitioners and policymakers valuable insights into how to encourage resilience and improve outcomes for care leavers.",

The participants comprised two samples of young people who were living in out\u2010of\u2010home care (mainly foster care) in the province of Ontario, Canada, 340 aged 10\u201315\u2003years and 132 aged 5\u20139\u2003years. Virtually all had experienced severe adversity in their families of origin, such that in most cases the legal custody, care, and control of the young people had been permanently transferred from their parents to a local Children's Aid Society.

The purpose of our study was to build an exploratory predictive model of psychological adjustment, defined in terms of anxiety and physical aggression. Participants comprised 220 young people, aged 14 to 17, residing in Ontario, Canada. Selected predictors consisted of the factors most commonly thought to favor positive psychological adjustment among young people. A series of hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to test predictive models of psychological adjustment. The findings revealed a significant association between lower levels of anxiety and higher-quality relationships with the female caregiver, a greater number of close friendships, and higher self-esteem. Less frequent physically aggressive behaviors were associated with a smaller number of primary caregivers, higher \u2026",

            "Since the beginnings of its development in Britain in 1987, the Looking After Children (LAC) initiative has had a profound influence in Canada-as well as in Australia and across Europe-in sharpening the developmental focus and improving the quality of services for children and adolescents who, because of abuse, neglect, extreme poverty, or other circumstances, live in out-of-home care. With its emphasis on high expectations, positive substitute parenting, and good short-term and long-term outcomes, LAC has been an important vehicle for promoting resilience (ie, positive outcomes in spite of serious threats to development) in child welfare, one that will remain a beneficial influence in Canada and internationally for many years to come. Promoting Resilience in Child Welfare presents reviews of research, new empirical findings, and useful practice and policy suggestions derived from the perspectives of LAC and resilience theory by an array of international voices. Practitioners, out-of-home care providers, youths in care, in-service trainers, students, researchers, and policy makers in Canada and across the world will find much in this book that speaks to more effective ways of improving the lives of young people being looked after in out-of-home care.",

            "In the present study, we formulated and tested a basic model of the educational success of young people in out-of-home care. We used data from 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 on a sample of 1106 young people in care in Ontario, Canada. The youths were 12\u201317 years of age; 56.24% were male and 43.76% female. The indicators of educational success in both years were the youth's average marks and the youth's school performance in reading, math, science and overall, as rated by his or her caregiver. Based on resilience theory and on a model of the influence of maltreatment on educational achievement, our model included four categories of predictors: control variables (youth gender and age and, in the longitudinal analyses, the year 7 value of the year 8 dependent variable), three placement types (foster, kinship care or group homes), three risk factors (previous repetition of a grade in school, a health \u2026",
