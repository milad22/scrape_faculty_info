            "We construct the Lagrangian for an effective theory of highly energetic quarks with energy Q, interacting with collinear and soft gluons. This theory has two low energy scales, the transverse momentum of the collinear particles, p\u22a5, and the scale p\u22a5 2\/Q. The heavy to light currents are matched onto operators in the effective theory at one loop and the renormalization group equations for the corresponding Wilson coefficients are solved. This running is used to sum Sudakov logarithms in inclusive B\u2192 X s \u03b3 and B\u2192 X u l \u03bd decays. We also show that the interactions with collinear gluons preserve the relations for the soft part of the form factors for heavy-to-light decays found by Charles et al.[Phys. Rev. D 60, 014001 (1999)], establishing these relations in the large energy limit of QCD.",

As a solution to this puzzle, we suggest that the dominant \u03c8\u2032 production mechanism is the fragmentation of a gluon into a c c pair in a pointlike color-octet S-wave state, which subsequently evolves nonperturbatively into a \u03c8\u2032 plus light hadrons. This contribution to the fragmentation function is enhanced by a short-distance factor of 1\/\u03b1 s 2, which may compensate for its suppression by v 4, where v is the relative momentum of the charm quark in the \u03c8\u2032.",

Our results are consistent with recent data on \u03c8 production from the CDF and D0 experiments.

Our analysis accounts for \u03b1 s corrections from the production and mass scales, corrections due to constraints in defining invariant masses, nonperturbative corrections from the cross talk between the jets, and \u03b1 s corrections to the Breit-Wigner line shape.

            "\u25aa Abstract Recent data from the Tevatron collider have revealed that the production rate of prompt charmonium at large transverse momentum is orders of magnitude larger than the best theories of a few years ago had predicted. These surprising results can be understood by taking into account two recent developments that have dramatically revised the theoretical description of heavy-quarkonium production. The first is the realization that fragmentation must dominate at large transverse momentum, which implies that most charmonium in this kinematic region is produced by the hadronization of individual high-p T partons. The second is the development of a factorization formalism for quarkonium production based on nonrelativistic QCD that allows the formation of charmonium from color-octet pairs to be treated systematically. This review summarizes these theoretical developments and their implications for \u2026",

            "The 1S0, 3S1, and 3D1 nucleon\u2013nucleon scattering phase shifts are calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in an effective field theory. Predictions for the 1P1, 3P0,1,2, 1D2, and 3D2,3 phase shifts at this order are also compared with data. The calculations treat pions perturbatively and include the NNLO contributions from order Qr3 and Qr4 radiation pion graphs. In the 3S1, 3D1 and 3P0,2 channels we find large disagreement with the Nijmegen partial-wave analysis at NNLO. These spin triplet channels have large corrections from graphs with two potential pion exchange which do not vanish in the chiral limit. We compare our results to calculations within the Weinberg approach, and find that in some spin triplet channels the summation of potential pion diagrams seems to be necessary to reproduce the observed phase shifts. In the spin singlet channels the nonperturbative treatment of potential pions \u2026",

            "We consider top quarks produced at large energy in e+ e\u2212 collisions, and address the question of what top mass can be measured from reconstruction. The production process is characterized by well-separated scales: the center-of-mass energy Q, the top mass m, the top decay width \u0393 t, and also \u039b QCD; scales which can be disentangled with effective theory methods. In particular we show how the mass measurement depends on the way in which soft radiation is treated, and that this can shift the mass peak by an amount of order Q \u039b QCD\/m. We sum large logs for Q\u226b m\u226b \u0393 t> \u039b QCD and demonstrate that the renormalization group ties together the jet and soft interactions below the scale m. Necessary conditions for the invariant mass spectrum to be protected from large logs are formulated.
