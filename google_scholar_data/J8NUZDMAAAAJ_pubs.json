            "Organic syntheses are composed of two main types of reactions: Carbon-carbon bond formations and functional group transformations. CC bond formation is the essence of organic synthesis1 and provides the foundation for generating more complicated organic compounds from simpler ones. Although enzymatic processes in nature must occur in an aqueous environment by necessity, water has been a solvent to be avoided for common organic reactions. Since the pioneering studies of Diels-Alder reactions by Breslow, 2 there has been increasing recognition that organic reactions can proceed well in aqueous media and offer advantages over those occurring in organic solvents. 3 A decade ago, the first comprehensive review on carbon-carbon bond formations in aqueous media was reported. 4 At that time, only a few dozen references existed in the literature on this subject, with the exception of hydroformylation \u2026",

            "  Synthetic chemists aspire both to develop novel chemical reactions and to improve reaction conditions to maximize resource efficiency, energy efficiency, product selectivity, operational simplicity, and environmental health and safety. Carbon\u2212carbon bond formation is a central part of many chemical syntheses, and innovations in these types of reactions will profoundly improve overall synthetic efficiency.This Account describes our work over the past several years to form carbon\u2212carbon bonds directly from two different C\u2212H bonds under oxidative conditions, cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). We have focused most of our efforts on carbon\u2212carbon bonds formed via the functionalization of sp3 C\u2212H bonds with other C\u2212H bonds. In the presence of simple and cheap catalysts such as copper and iron salts and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, dioxygen, tert-butylhydroperoxide, and 2,3-dichloro-5,6 \u2026",
