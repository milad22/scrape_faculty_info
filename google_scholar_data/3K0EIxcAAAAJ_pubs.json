The Ni\/ITO (10 nm\/250 nm) layers were prepared by thermal evaporation and rf magnetron sputtering, respectively. Although the as-deposited Ni\/ITO contacts present rectified behavior, the linear current\u2013voltage characteristics can be obtained. The contact resistance can be reduced significantly for the ITO\/Ni\/p-GaN samples after suitable rapid thermal process. The contact property of ITO\/Ni\/p-GaN shows lowest specific contact resistivity of 8.6\u00d710\u22124\u200a\u03a9\u200acm2 and high transparency (above 80% for 450\u2013550 nm) as the sample annealed at 600\u200a\u00b0C in air. Possible mechanisms for the observed low contact resistance and high transparency will be discussed. The present process is compatible with the fabrication for the high-efficient GaN light-emitting devices.",

For a typical lamp-form PSS LED operating at a forward current of 20 mA, the output power and external quantum efficiency were estimated to be 10.4 mW and 14.1%, respectively.
