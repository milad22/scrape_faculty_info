VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the \u2026",

During a five-week pilot, a group of students spent after-school time learning the basic elements of dance and then using them to program three-dimensional characters that could perform. Throughout the pilot, we found students consistently standing up in front of their computers and using their bodies to think through the actuation of their characters. Preliminary results suggest that designing a virtual-physical dance performance is a motivating and engaging social context in which to introduce students, especially girls, to alternative applications in computing.",

Specifically, it examines qualitative case study research findings and student examples from a dance artist-in-residence that explored curricular content using dance as its primary mode of enquiry and expression. Throughout the residency, students constructed meaning through their dance experiences in dynamic and autonomous ways, exhibiting complex literacy practices of enquiry and communication. Focusing on the kindergarten student participants\u2019 experiences, the authors highlight three themes in their dance literacy practices: (a) artistic autonomy, (b) embodied knowledge and (c) multimodality. As embodied knowledge, dance innately allowed for integrative literacy possibilities in the dance residency.

The author provides examples from the residency of how these signatures theoretically align with the data, demonstrating how these students engaged with curricular and dance content through embodied democratic practices.

Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks.

The purpose of this article, which documents and presents pilot study findings from a dance workshop that engaged practicing teachers surrounding the issue of immigration, is to understand how dance can be integrated into the curriculum to prepare students to engage in democratic deliberation. Data collection consisted of pre- and post-workshop interviews with participants and was analyzed based on common principles of democracy and democratic education found in the literature. Findings point to the important role that dance could have in developing the trust, empathy, and reflectiveness necessary to engage in civil dialogue that is the essential foundation of a democratic society.",

            "This dissertation chronicles the qualitative case study of a dance artist-in-residence at a diverse and inclusive K-5 school in an urban district, integrating science, social studies, physical education, music, and visual arts school curriculum and culminating in two public performances. This study focused on how students made meaning through this dance experience and what this tells us about knowledge, dance, movement, and the body in schools and how this can help us improve education through using dance and movement. Using Joan Scott's (1991; 1993) notion of experience as fundamentally historical and theoretical as my theoretical framework for exploring the notion of experience, I examined student experiences, collecting data throughout the residency and post-residency in multiple forms: observations, interviews, photographic and video footage, student work in archival and performative forms, residency artifacts, and curricular materials. One of the most significant findings of this study was the disruption of the school caused by the dance residency. I found that there were five categories of interactions and relationships that caused and affected this disruption and subsequently lead to the success of the whole-school dance residency as a positive and complex school intervention:(1) Assumptions;(2) Disjunctures;(3) Challenges;(4) Introductions; and (5) Expressions\/Representations. In my analysis chapters, I discuss these interactions and relationships within the context of the residency. Based upon them, I make recommendations for future arts and dance intervention programs and for using the arts as a form of assessment of students' \u2026",
