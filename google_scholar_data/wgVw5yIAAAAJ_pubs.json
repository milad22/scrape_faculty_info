            "A Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometric magnetic field sensor based on a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) and magnetic fluid (MF) was designed and experimentally demonstrated. The sensing probe consists of a single-mode-(SM)-multimode-PCF-SM fiber structure through arc fusion splicing. It was then laser engrave notched with the femtosecond laser so that the PCF cladding was selectively infilled MF. A well-defined interference pattern was obtained on account of the tunable refractive index of the MF infilled PCF cladding. The transmission spectra of the proposed sensor under different magnetic field intensities have been measured and theoretically analyzed. The results show that the sensitivity of the proposed sensor can reach \u22120.13\u2009\u2009dB\/mT and 0.07334 nm\/mT in the magnetic field intensity from 1 mT to 20 mT and 2 mT to 20 mT, respectively.",

            "Corrosion of steel bar is one of key factors undermining reinforced concrete (RC) structures in a harsh environment. This paper attempts to review the non-destructive procedures from the aspect of the corrosion measurement techniques, especially their advantages and limitations. Systematical classification of diagnostic methods is carried out to determine any probable corrosion issues before the structures become severe, and helps choose the suitable method according to different construction features. Furthermore, the three electrochemical factors method is introduced to inspire researchers to combine various techniques to improve corrosion evaluation accuracy. The recommendations for future work are summarized, in conclusion. View Full-Text",

            "In this work, we experimentally investigated the effect of CO_2 laser pretreatment on regenerated grating formulated in few-mode fibers (FMFs) (two-mode and four-mode step-index fibers). In the preparation, the pristine FMFs were first treated with direct CO_2 laser annealing followed by a slow cooling procedure to minimize the frozen-in stresses and the thermal stresses in the fibers before the grating inscription. After the thermal regeneration process, the produced regenerated gratings (RGs) were then subject to a thermal durability test at 1050\u00b0C for 10 h. In the comparison against the results from the RGs formulated in non-treated FMFs, the finding indicates that RGs in treated fibers have a better regeneration ratio and thermal resilience. It is believed that the thermal stress relaxation and structural rearrangement in the fiber glass are the major factors that lead to the lower grating recovery during the state of \u2026",

            "We proposed an analytical model to describe the relationship between the axial stress profile of a few-mode fiber Bragg grating with the variations in the resonant wavelengths during a chemical etching process. As a mechanism of preserving state of equilibrium, the etched fiber is experiencing a varying axial strain\u2014contractive or expansive depending on the total axial stress over the remaining cross-sectional area of the fiber. It is found that the induced strain on the etched fiber is the main constituent to the blueshifts and redshifts in the resonant wavelengths during the etching process. The proposed model has been experimentally verified and the estimated axial stress profiles are in good agreement with the measurement by the polariscopic technique.",

The FMFBGs at both the ends of the FMF segment that serve as selective mode converters enable the pulse stream to double pass the FMF segment twice via access to the optical path length on LP 11  mode in the FMF. The induced time delay by the proposed system is approximately four times the time delay of a single pass in the FMF segment. The proposed system has opened up a new horizon in the optical buffering technology for an optical communication system.",

Specifically, we investigate the behavior of the thermal decay, recovery and eventually the permanent erasure of the gratings in the temperature range from 25 to 1300 C. In the domain of demarcation energy, the thermal responses of the gratings can be normalized and they share similar characteristic curves despite the different temperature ramping rates used in the annealing treatment. It is found that the demarcation energy at the regeneration point and the attempt-to-escape frequency for each grating can be associated with the confinement factors of the fibers. The finding in this work has provided a new insight in the manufacture of regenerated fiber Bragg grating sensors by using few-mode fibers for multiparameter sensing in high temperature environments.",

The etched FM-FBG has been fabricated and its intrinsic property of having different sensitivities for different reflection peaks in the spectrum has been used for sensing the multiple parameters, such as temperature and refractive index of the ambient environment. The experimental characterization of the fabricated etched FM-FBG sensor has been carried out by using six samples of standard sodium chloride (NaCl(aq)) solutions with refractive indices (RIs) ranging from 1.3159 to 1.3375 at 24 \u00b0C temperature. The reflection spectra have been acquired for each sample by varying the temperature from 24 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C. The temperature and RI sensitivities have been investigated \u2026",

The RCG is manufactured from an 18-mm long seed chirped grating through a thermal annealing treatment, to enhance its thermal resistance and durability against the high temperature induced by the CO 2  laser irradiation. The intensity profile of the incident laser on the grating can be determined from the phase shift derivative function calculated from the output spectra of the interferometer. By scanning the grating across the laser beam, a 2-D intensity profile of the CO 2  laser can be attained.",
