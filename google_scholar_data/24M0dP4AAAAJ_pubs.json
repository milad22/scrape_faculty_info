The observations of this prestellar core provide a natural test for theoretical models of core formation and evolution. Based on their results, the above authors claim a discrepancy with the implied infall motions from ambipolar diffusion models. In this paper, we reexamine the earlier ambipolar diffusion models and conclude that the L1544 core can be understood to be a magnetically supercritical core undergoing magnetically diluted collapse. We also present a new ambipolar diffusion model specifically designed to simulate the formation and evolution of the L1544 core. This model, which uses reasonable input parameters, yields mass and radial density distributions, as well as neutral and ion infall speed profiles, that are in very good agreement with physical values \u2026",

The epoch of point-mass formation (PMF) is investigated by a self-consistent extension of previously presented models of core formation and contraction in axisymmetric, self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetically supported interstellar molecular clouds. Prior to PMF, the core is dynamically contracting and is not well approximated by a quasi-static equilibrium model. Ambipolar diffusion, which plays a key role in the early evolution of the core, is unimportant during the dynamical pre-PMF collapse phase. However, the appearance of a central mass, through its effect on the gravitational field in the inner core regions, leads to a\" revitalization\" of ambipolar diffusion in the weakly ionized \u2026",
