The approximations involved in the CMD method are thus fully characterized by mathematical derivations. Additional new approaches are also presented: centroid Hamiltonian dynamics (CHD), linearized quantum dynamics (LQD), and a perturbative correction of the LQD method (PT-LQD). The CHD method is shown to be a variation of the CMD method which conserves the approximate time dependent centroid Hamiltonian. The LQD method amounts to a linear approximation for the quantum Liouville equation, while the PT-LQD method includes a perturbative correction to the LQD method. All of these approaches are then tested for the equilibrium position \u2026",

The equilibrium centroid distribution is first shown to be a well-defined distribution function which is specific to the canonical density operator. A quantum mechanical quasi-density operator (QDO) is associated with each value of the distribution so that, upon application of the standard quantum mechanical formalism, the QDO can be used to provide a rigorous definition of both static and dynamical centroid variables. Various properties of the dynamical centroid variables are derived, including the perspective that the centroid constraint on the imaginary time paths introduces a nonstationarity in the equilibrium ensemble which, in turn, can be shown to \u2026",

The results are compared with those based on the theory of F\u00f6rster's resonance energy transfer. It is shown that coherently coupled multichromophores can speed up the transfer of energy substantially and in a way insensitive to the disorder.",

            "A theory of coherent resonance energy transfer [Jang et al., J. Chem. Phys. 129, 101104 (2008)] is extended for coherent initial condition. For the situation where the initial excitation is an arbitrary linear combination of donor and acceptor excitations, a second order time local quantum master equation combined with polaron transformation is derived. Inhomogeneous terms in the resulting equation have contributions not only from initial donor and acceptor populations but also from their coherence terms. Numerical tests are performed for general super Ohmic spectral density where the bath degrees of freedom coupled to donor and acceptor can be correlated with each other. Calculation results demonstrate sensitivity of early nonstationary population dynamics on the relative sign of initial donor and acceptor excitation states. It is shown that contribution of inhomogeneous terms is more significant for coherent initial \u2026",
