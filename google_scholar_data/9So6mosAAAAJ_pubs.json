            "Three-dimensional topological insulators are a new state of quantum matter with a bulk gap and odd number of relativistic Dirac fermions on the surface. By investigating the surface state of Bi2Te3 with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the surface state consists of a single nondegenerate Dirac cone. Furthermore, with appropriate hole doping, the Fermi level can be tuned to intersect only the surface states, indicating a full energy gap for the bulk states. Our results establish that Bi2Te3 is a simple model system for the three-dimensional topological insulator with a single Dirac cone on the surface. The large bulk gap of Bi2Te3 also points to promising potential for high-temperature spintronics applications.",

This state is predicted to become massive if time reversal symmetry is broken, and to become insulating if the Fermi energy is positioned inside both the surface and bulk gaps. We introduced magnetic dopants into the three-dimensional topological insulator dibismuth triselenide (Bi2Se3) to break the time reversal symmetry and further position the Fermi energy inside the gaps by simultaneous magnetic and charge doping. The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.",

However, the conductivity of these compounds tends to be dominated by the bulk of the material because of chemical imperfection, making the transport properties of the surface nearly impossible to measure.

Similarly, the new iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition (i.e., a broken C4 symmetry) that either precedes or is coincident with a collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undoped parent compounds, and superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed via doping. Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of compounds has been reported by neutron scattering, scanning tunneling microscopy, and transport measurements.
