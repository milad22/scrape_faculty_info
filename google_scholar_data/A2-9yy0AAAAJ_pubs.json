            "A class of models for relaxation in strongly interacting glassy materials is suggested. Degrees of freedom are divided into a sequence of levels such that those in level n+ 1 are locked except when some of those in level n find the right combination to release them, this representing the hierarchy of constraints in real systems. The Kohlrausch anomalous relaxation law, exp [\u2212(t \u03c4) \u03b2], emerges naturally, and a maximum time scale is found which exhibits a Vogel-Fulcher-type temperature dependence.",

The solution provides a description of fluctuation dynamics of systems with many degenerate states separated by a hierarchy of energy barriers. Dynamical behavior is found to depend on the scaling of barriers with ultrametric distance. We find a range of interesting behavior, from temperature-dependent power-law decay to the Kohlrausch law.",
