Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: \u03b1 = 1\/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge \u2212 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge \u2212 2; a 2.5\u03c3 tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon\u2019s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level \u2026",

Expressed within the standard model extension (SME) or Nordtvedt\u2019s anisotropic universe model, the analysis limits four coefficients describing anisotropic gravity at the ppb level and three others, for the first time, at the 10 ppm level.

This effect, known as gravitational redshift, is important to the operation of the global positioning system 2, timekeeping 3, 4 and future experiments with ultra-precise, space-based clocks 5 (such as searches for variations in fundamental constants). The gravitational redshift has been measured using clocks on a tower 6, an aircraft 7 and a rocket 8, currently reaching an accuracy of 7\u00d7 10-5. Here we show that laboratory experiments based on quantum interference of atoms 9, 10 enable a much more precise measurement, yielding an accuracy of 7\u00d7 10-9.

Chameleon fields and other theories with screening mechanisms, however, can evade these tests by suppressing the forces in regions of high density, such as the laboratory. Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber, we reduced the screening mechanism by probing the field with individual atoms rather than with bulk matter. We thereby constrained a wide class of dark energy theories, including a range of chameleon and other theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration.",
