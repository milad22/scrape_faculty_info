            "Evaluation of the electrostatic properties of biomolecules has become a standard practice in molecular biophysics. Foremost among the models used to elucidate the electrostatic potential is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; however, existing methods for solving this equation have limited the scope of accurate electrostatic calculations to relatively small biomolecular systems. Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures. The results point to the likely role of electrostatics in a variety of activities of these structures.",

This new edition presents mathematical concepts and quantitative tools that are essential for effective use of modern computational methods that play a key role in the practical solution of boundary value problems. With a careful blend of theory and applications, the authors successfully bridge the gap between real analysis, functional analysis, nonlinear analysis, nonlinear partial differential equations, integral equations, approximation theory, and numerical analysis to provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding and analyzing core mathematical and computational modeling problems. Thoroughly updated and revised to reflect recent developments, the book includes an extensive new chapter on the modern tools of computational mathematics for boundary value problems.

The equation is discretized with the finite volume method, and the numerical solution of the discrete equations is accomplished with multiple grid techniques originally developed for twodimensional interface problems occurring in reactor physics. A detailed analysis of the resulting method is presented for several computer architectures, including comparisons to diagonally scaled CG, ICCG, vectorized ICCG and MICCG, and to SOR provided with an optimal relaxation parameter. Our results indicate that the multigrid method is superior to the preconditioned CG methods and SOR and that the advantage of multigrid grows with the problem size. \u00a9 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

In this first article, we explain how adaptive multilevel finite element methods can be used to obtain extremely accurate solutions to the PBE with very modest computational resources, and we present some illustrative examples using two well\u2010known test problems. The PBE is first discretized with piece\u2010wise linear finite elements over a very coarse simplex triangulation of the domain.
