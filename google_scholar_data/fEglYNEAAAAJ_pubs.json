            "Performance testing is one of the most common and important measures used in sports science and physiology. Performance tests allow for a controlled simulation of sports and exercise performance for research or applied science purposes. There are three factors that contribute to a good performance test: (i) validity; (ii) reliability; and (iii) sensitivity. A valid protocol is one that resembles the performance that is being simulated as closely as possible. When investigating race-type events, the two most common protocols are time to exhaustion and time trials. Time trials have greater validity than time to exhaustion because they provide a good physiological simulation of actual performance and correlate with actual performance. Sports such as soccer are more difficult to simulate. While shuttle-running protocols such as the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test may simulate physiology of soccer using time \u2026",

Introduction: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ingesting a glucose plus fructose drink compared with a glucose-only drink (both delivering carbohydrate at a rate of 1.8 gIminj1) and a water placebo on endurance performance. Methods: Eight male trained cyclists were recruited (age 32 T 7 yr, weight 84.4 T 6.9 kg, VO2max 64.7 T 3.9 mLIkgj1Iminj1, Wmax 364 T 31 W). Subjects ingested either a water placebo (P), a glucose (G)-only beverage (1.8 gIminj1), or a glucose and fructose (GF) beverage in a 2: 1 ratio (1.8 gIminj1) during 120 min of cycling exercise at 55% Wmax followed by a time trial in which subjects had to complete a set amount of work as quickly as possible (~ 1 h). Every 15 min, expired gases were analyzed and blood samples were collected. Results: Ingestion of GF resulted in an 8% quicker time to completion during the time trial (4022 s) compared with G (3641 s) and a 19% improvement compared with W (3367 s). Total carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation was not different between GF (2.54 T 0.25 gIminj1) and G (2.50 gIminj1), suggesting that GF led to a sparing of endogenous CHO stores, because GF has been shown to have a greater exogenous CHO oxidation than G. Conclusion: Ingestion of GF led to an 8% improvement in cycling time-trial performance compared with ingestion of G. Key Words: GLUCOSE, FRUCTOSE,",

            "UNLABELLED: Pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter drug to relieve nasal and sinus congestion. Although it has been suggested that pseudoephedrine could be a stimulant and ergogenic aid, pseudoephedrine was recently removed from the banned substance list by the International Olympic Committee and placed on the monitoring program (from January 2004). It was felt that evidence was lacking for an ergogenic effect, although few studies have investigated the effects of pseudoephedrine on exercise performance. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of pseudoephedrine on 1500-m running performance. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized crossover design, seven male athletes completed two 1500-m running trials on an outdoor track after having completed a familiarization trial. All trials were 7 d apart. After a 12-h overnight fast, subjects reported to the laboratory and received a standardized breakfast (energy asymptotically equal to 500 kcal 50% CHO). Subjects were given either 2.5 mg. kg (-1) bw pseudoephedrine or 2.5 mg. kg (-1) bw maltodextrins (placebo) in gelatin capsules 70 min before the start of the warm-up, which started 20 min before they ran 1500 m all-out. Pre-and postexercise blood samples were collected and analyzed for lactate and glucose concentrations, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (PCO2), and percent oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Pseudoephedrine significantly decreased time to completion of 1500-m time trials in the present study by 2.1%(from 279.65+\/-4.36 s with placebo to 273.86+\/-4.36 s with pseudoephedrine) with no reported side effects.
