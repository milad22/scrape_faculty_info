            "In the search for multiferroic materials magnetic compounds with a strongly elongated unit-cell (large axial ratio c\/a) have been scrutinized intensely. However, none was hitherto proven to have a switchable polarization, an essential feature of ferroelectrics. Here, we provide evidence for the epitaxial stabilization of a monoclinic phase of BiFeO 3 with a giant axial ratio (c\/a= 1.23) that is both ferroelectric and magnetic at room temperature. Surprisingly, and in contrast with previous theoretical predictions, the polarization does not increase dramatically with c\/a. We discuss our results in terms of the competition between polar and antiferrodistortive instabilities and give perspectives for engineering multiferroic phases.",

Such precise comparison allows us to provide a bridge between the atomistic and macroscopic descriptions of the ECE and identify the factors that may critically compromise or even destroy their equivalence. Our computational data reveal the intrinsic features of ECE in ferroelectrics with multiple ferroelectric transitions and confirm the potential of these materials to exhibit giant electrocaloric response.
