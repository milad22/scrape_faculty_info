            "We review the state of observational and theoretical studies of the shaping of planetary nebulae (PNe) and protoplanetary nebulae (pPNe). In the past decade, high-resolution studies of PNe have revealed a bewildering array of morphologies with elaborate symmetries. Recent imaging studies of pPNe exhibit an even richer array of shapes. The variety of shapes, sometimes multiaxial symmetries, carefully arranged systems of low-ionization knots and jets, and the often Hubble-flow kinematics of PNe and pPNe indicate that there remains much to understand about the last stages of stellar evolution. In many cases, the basic symmetries and shapes of these objects develop on extremely short timescales, seemingly at the end of AGB evolution when the mode of mass loss abruptly and radically changes. No single explanation fits all of the observations. The shaping process may be related to external \u2026",

The method is based on the staggered mesh technique to constrain the transport of magnetic field: the magnetic field components are defined at grid interfaces with their advective fluxes on grid edges, while other quantities are defined at grid centers. The magnetic field at grid centers for the upwind step is calculated by interpolating the values from grid interfaces. The advective fluxes on grid edges for the magnetic field evolution are calculated from the upwind fluxes at grid interfaces. Then the magnetic field can be maintained with\u2207 bold dot {\\bmi B}= 0 exactly, if this is so initially, while the upwind scheme is used for the update of fluid quantities.

The convergent flows are created by electrodynamic acceleration of plasma in a conical array of fine metallic wires (a modification of the wire array Z\u2010pinch). Stagnation of plasma flow on the axis of symmetry forms a standing conical shock effectively collimating the flow in the axial direction. This scenario is essentially similar to that discussed by Cant\u00f3 and collaborators as a purely hydrodynamic mechanism for jet formation in astrophysical systems. Experiments using different materials (Al, Fe, and W) show that a highly supersonic ( ), well\u2010collimated jet is generated when the radiative cooling rate of the plasma is significant.

A shock forms near the boundary between the winds, creating the relatively dense shell characteristic of a planetary nebula. A spherically symmetric wind will produce a spherically symmetric shell, yet over half of known planetary nebulae are not spherical; rather, they are elliptical or bipolar in shape 2. A magnetic field could launch and collimate a bipolar outflow, but the origin of such a field has hitherto been unclear, and some previous work has even suggested that a field could not be generated 3. Here we show that an asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star can indeed generate a strong magnetic field, having as its origin a dynamo at the interface between the rapidly rotating core and the more slowly rotating envelope of the star.

            "In many ways the discovery that star formation involves outflow as well as inflow from gravitational collapse marked the beginning of modern studies of the assembly of stars. Jets and outflows were the first and most easily observed recognition that the narrative of star formation would include many players and processes beyond the spherical collapse of clouds. The extraordinary progress made in the study of protostellar jets and outflows since the first discovery of Herbig-Haro (HH) objects (1950s), HH jets (1980s), and molecular outflows (1980s) also reflects the growing power and sophistication of star-formation science. The combination of ever-higher-resolution observational and computational methods, combined with innovative laboratory experiments, have allowed many aspects of the protostellar outflow problem to be clarified, although as we shall see, crucial issues such as the launching process (es) remain debated. Hypersonic collimated protostellar mass loss appears to be a ubiquitous aspect of the star-formation process. The observations currently indicate that most, if not all, low-and high-mass stars produce accretion-powered collimated ejections during their formation. These ejections are traced in two ways [see, eg, the excellent Protostars and Planets V (PPV) observational reviews by Ray et al.(2007), Arce et al.(2007), Bally et al.(2007)].First there are the narrow, highly collimated \u201cjets\u201d of atomic and\/or molecular gas with velocities on the order of v~ 100\u2212 1000 km s\u20131 (v increasing with central source mass). These jets are believed to arise through magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes in the rotating star-disk system. The other \u2026",

Our scaled laboratory experiments, representative of young stellar object outflows, reveal that stable and narrow collimation of the entire flow can result from the presence of a poloidal magnetic field whose strength is consistent with observations. The laboratory plasma becomes focused with an interior cavity. This gives rise to a standing conical shock from which the jet emerges. Following simulations of the process at the full astrophysical scale, we conclude that it can also explain recently discovered x-ray emission features observed in low-density regions at the base of protostellar jets, such as the well-studied jet HH 154.",

Multiple spatial dimensions are treated through a Strang-type operator splitting. The constraint of a divergence-free field is enforced exactly by calculating a correction via a gauge transformation in each time step.Results from two-dimensional shock tube tests show that the code captures correctly discontinuities in all three MHD waves families as well as contact discontinuities. The numerical viscosities and resistivity in the code, which are useful in order to understand simulations involving turbulent flows, are estimated through the decay of two-dimensional linear waves. Finally, the robustness of the code in two-dimensions is demonstrated through calculations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the Orszag-Tang vortex.",
