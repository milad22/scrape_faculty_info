            "Arc volcanism is intimately linked to mineral dehydration reactions in the subducting oceanic mantle, crust, and sediments. The location of slab dehydration reactions depends strongly on the temperature and pressure conditions at the top of the subducting plate and hence on the detailed thermal structure of subduction zones. A particularly important physical property of subduction zone thermal models is the viscosity of the mantle wedge. The introduction of an olivine rheology, with appropriate stress and temperature dependence, focuses flow into the tip of the mantle wedge. This leads to a temperature increase of a few hundred degrees in the wedge and the top of the slab as compared to the isoviscous case. Sensitivity tests show that this conclusion is robust under a variety of subduction zone parameters. The new high\u2010resolution finite element models are used to reevaluate the thermal structure of the Honshu \u2026",

            "Catalysis by single isolated atoms of precious metals has attracted much recent interest, as it promises the ultimate in atom efficiency. Most previous reports are on reducible oxide supports. Here we show that isolated palladium atoms can be catalytically active on industrially relevant \u03b3-alumina supports. The addition of lanthanum oxide to the alumina, long known for its ability to improve alumina stability, is found to also help in the stabilization of isolated palladium atoms. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm the presence of intermingled palladium and lanthanum on the \u03b3-alumina surface. Carbon monoxide oxidation reactivity measurements show onset of catalytic activity at 40 C. The catalyst activity can be regenerated by oxidation at 700 C in air. The high-temperature stability and regenerability of these ionic palladium species make \u2026",

However, until now, there lacked experimental evidence to verify the predicted high-pressure structures for cold-compressed elemental carbon at least up to 50 GPa. Here we present direct experimental evidence that this enigmatic high-pressure structure is currently only consistent with M-carbon, one of the proposed carbon structures. Furthermore, we show that this phase transition is extremely sluggish, which led to the observed broad x-ray diffraction peaks in previous studies and hindered the proper identification of the post-graphite phase in cold-compressed carbon.",
