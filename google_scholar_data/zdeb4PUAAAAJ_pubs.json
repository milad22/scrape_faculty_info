Such invariants protect the \u201ctopological insulator\u201d phase and give rise to a spin Hall effect carried by edge states. Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z 2 invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z 2 invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z 2 invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.",

The time evolution of simple (unentangled) initial states is studied numerically for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension described by the random-field X X Z Hamiltonian. Interactions induce a dramatic change in the propagation of entanglement and a smaller change in the propagation of particles. For even weak interactions, when the system is thought to be in a many-body localized phase, entanglement shows neither localized nor diffusive behavior but grows without limit in an infinite system: interactions act as a singular perturbation on the localized state with no interactions. The significance for proposed atomic experiments is that local measurements will show a large but nonthermal entropy in the many-body localized state. This entropy develops \u2026",

The QSHE requires an energy gap in the bulk and gapless edge modes that conduct spin-up and spin-down excitations in opposite directions. When the number of Kramers pairs of edge modes is odd, certain one-particle scattering processes are forbidden due to a topological Z 2 index. We show that in a many-body description, there are other scattering processes that can localize the edge modes and destroy the QSHE: the region of stability for both classes of models (even or odd number of Kramers pairs) is obtained explicitly in the chiral boson theory. For a single Kramers pair, the QSHE is stable to weak interactions and disorder, while for two Kramers pairs it is not; however, the two-pair case can be stabilized by either finite attractive or repulsive \u2026",

A self-contained introduction to the single-particle theory is then given, followed by the many-particle definition of a topological insulator as a material with quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The last section reviews recent work on strongly correlated topological insulators and new effects that arise from the proximity effect between a topological insulator and a superconductor.
