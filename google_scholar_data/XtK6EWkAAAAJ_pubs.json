            "When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect 1, 2 dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin\u2013orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit 3, 4, 5, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields 6. Bulk Bi 1-x Sb x single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates 7, 8 for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator 9, 10, 11. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

Exotic spin-transport phenomena, such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect, have been speculated to originate from a topological order whose identification requires a spin-sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any system. Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture\u2013imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi1\u2013xSbx, we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties.

            "The development of ferromagnetism in Mn-doped Bi 2 Te 3 is characterized through measurements on a series of single crystals with different Mn content. Scanning tunneling microscopy analysis shows that the Mn substitutes on the Bi sites, forming compounds of the type Bi 2\u2212 x Mn x Te 3, and that the Mn substitutions are randomly distributed, not clustered. Mn doping first gives rise to local magnetic moments with Curie-like behavior, but by the compositions Bi 1.96 Mn 0.04 Te 3 and Bi 1.91 Mn 0.09 Te 3, a second-order ferromagnetic transition is observed, with T C\u223c 9\u201312 K. The easy axis of magnetization in the ferromagnetic phase is perpendicular to the Bi 2 Te 3 basal plane. Thermoelectric power and Hall effect measurements show that the Mn-doped Bi 2 Te 3 crystals are p-type. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that the topological surface states that are present in pristine Bi \u2026",
