A distribution of pitting and repassivation potentials was observed at each Cl\u2212 concentration. Factors controlling the transition from metastable to stable pitting were identified by comparing the electrochemical behaviors of stable pits at elapsed times equal to the mean lifetime of metastable pits. This comparison also provided insight on the origins of statistical distributions of pitting potentials. The key differences were that (i) stable pits had a faster rate of rise in pit current which implies a faster growth rate and, subsequently, larger pit radii at times equal to metastable pit lifetimes, and (ii) stable pits satisfied the criterion, at all times during growth, indicating that a concentrated solution must be maintained for pit survival \u2026",

Electrochemical impedance, as well as statistical and spectral electrochemical noise methods for obtaining polarization resistance, also were discussed. Traditional sources of error such as high excitation voltage amplitudes, insufficiently slow voltage ramp rates, high alternating current (AC) frequencies, inadequate polarization hold periods, high solution resistance, presence of parallel reduction-oxidation reactions, and nonuniform current and potential distributions were examined with the goal of defining some of the conditions and \u2026",

It was determined that analysis of impedance data, while accounting for a physically justified inductive response at low frequencies, enabled the determination of the polarization resistance, RP at the zero frequency limit. The determination of RP, as evaluated herein from electrochemical testing, provided excellent correlation to the mass loss and volume of hydrogen collected.

The method is, therefore, particularly suitable for the early detection of the degradation of highly resistive protective organic coatings on metals. Initial application of electrical methods for evaluating organic coatings on steel involved measurement of DC resistance or determination of an equivalent capacitance measured at a single frequency. Changes in the capacitance relate to the uptake of water while changes in the resistance of the coating have been analyzed in terms of penetration by ionic species from the environment. In recent years the measurement of the frequency-dependent impedance of a coating has allowed a more detailed evaluation based on the deviation of the coating impedance from a capacitive response.

They suggest that the sudden onset of corrosion is explained by an explosive autocatalytic growth in the number of metastable pits and that stabilization of individual pits takes place only later. This finding agrees with a theoretical approach treating the onset of pitting corrosion as a cooperative critical phenomenon resulting from interactions among metastable pits, and it extends perspectives on the control and prevention of corrosion onset.",
