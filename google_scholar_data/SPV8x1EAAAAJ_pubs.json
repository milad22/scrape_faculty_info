            "We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron\u2013positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward\u2013backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, m Z and \u0393 Z, and its couplings to fermions, for example the \u03c1 parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured: m Z= 91.1875\u00b10.0021 GeV, \u0393 Z= 2.4952\u00b10.0023 GeV, \u03c1 \u2113= 1.0050\u00b10.0010, sin 2 \u03b8 eff lept= 0.23153\u00b10.00016. The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840\u00b10.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions \u2026",

            "The D\u00d8 experiment enjoyed a very successful data-collection run at the Fermilab Tevatron collider between 1992 and 1996. Since then, the detector has been upgraded to take advantage of improvements to the Tevatron and to enhance its physics capabilities. We describe the new elements of the detector, including the silicon microstrip tracker, central fiber tracker, solenoidal magnet, preshower detectors, forward muon detector, and forward proton detector. The uranium\/liquid-argon calorimeters and central muon detector, remaining from Run I, are discussed briefly. We also present the associated electronics, triggering, and data acquisition systems, along with the design and implementation of software specific to D\u00d8.",

For a top quark mass of 170 GeV\/c 2, we obtain \u03c3 t t= 8.18\u2212 0.87+ 0.98 pb in agreement with the theoretical prediction. Based on predictions from higher order quantum chromodynamics, we extract a mass for the top quark from the combined t t cross section, consistent with the world average of the top quark mass. In addition, the ratios of t t cross sections in different final states are used to set upper limits on the branching fractions B (t\u2192 H+ b\u2192 \u03c4+ \u03bd b) and B (t\u2192 H+ b\u2192 c s b) as a function of the charged Higgs boson mass.",

In particular, the masses of the top quark (M t) and W boson (M W) 1 constrain the mass of the long-hypothesized, but thus far not observed, Higgs boson. A precise measurement of M t can therefore indicate where to look for the Higgs, and indeed whether the hypothesis of a standard model Higgs is consistent with experimental data. As top quarks are produced in pairs and decay in only about 10-24 s into various final states, reconstructing their masses from their decay products is very challenging. Here we report a technique that extracts more information from each top-quark event and yields a greatly improved precision (of\u00b15.3 GeV\/c 2) when compared to previous measurements 2.

When corrected for detector acceptance and resolution, the asymmetry is found to be (19.6\u00b16.5)%. We also measure a corrected asymmetry based on the lepton from a top quark decay, found to be (15.2\u00b14.0)%. The results are compared to predictions based on the next-to-leading-order QCD generator mc@ nlo.

These measurements are based on a data set of approximately 160 000 hadronicZ 0 decays and 18 000 decays into electrons, muons and taus, recorded by the OPAL experiment at centre of mass energies near the mass of theZ 0. The total width and the partial widths to visible final states, derived from the measured cross sections, are used to extract the invisible width. The effective couplings of theZ 0 to charged leptons are studied using measurements of the lepton pair cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries at the different centre of mass energy points of theZ 0 scan.
