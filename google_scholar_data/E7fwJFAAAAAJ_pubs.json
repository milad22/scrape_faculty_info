            "Undoped, high-quality diamond is, under almost all circumstances, one of the best insulators known. However, diamond covered with chemically bound hydrogen shows a pronounced conductivity when exposed to air. This conductivity arises from positive-charge carriers (holes) and is confined to a narrow near-surface region. Although several explanations have been proposed, none has received wide acceptance, and the mechanism remains controversial. Here, we report the interactions of hydrogen-terminated, macroscopic diamonds and diamond powders with aqueous solutions of controlled pH and oxygen concentration. We show that electrons transfer between the diamond and an electrochemical reduction\/oxidation couple involving oxygen. This charge transfer is responsible for the surface conductivity and also influences contact angles and zeta potentials. The effect is not confined to diamond and may \u2026",

This is attributed to the more negative flat band potential of nanowires compared to the nanoparticles as determined by open circuit photo voltage measurements made at high light intensities. The nanowires were employed in hybrid structures consisting of highly interconnected SnO2 nanowire matrix coated with TiO2 nanoparticles, which showed an open circuit voltage of 720\u2009mV and an efficiency of 4.1% compared to 2.1% obtained with pure SnO2 nanowire matrix. The electron transport time constants for SnO2 nanowire matrix were an order of magnitude lower and the recombination time constants are about 100 times higher than that of TiO2 nanoparticles.

However, the interfacial charge transfer processes play a pivotal role in dictating the net photoconversion efficiency. We present here kinetics of hole transfer, characterization of the intermediates involved in the hole oxidation of sulfide ion, and the back electron transfer between sulfide radical and electrons injected into TiO2 nanoparticles. The kinetic rate constant (107\u2013109 s\u20131) for the hole transfer obtained from the emission lifetime measurements suggests slow hole scavenging from CdSe by S2\u2013 is one of the limiting factors in attaining high overall efficiency. The presence of the oxidized couple, by addition of S or Se to the electrolyte, increases the photocurrent, but it also enhances the rate of back electron transfer.",

UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy shows that the band gap of WO3 reduced from 2.9 eV to 2.2 eV after nitridation to W2N. Photoelectrochemical properties of both WO3 and W2N nanowire array electrodes were investigated. WO3 nanowire arrays show maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 85% at 370 nm at 1.2 V vs. SCE. The high quantum efficiency is attributed to the nanowire architecture which ensures efficient light absorption and charge transport. The nanowire arrays were stable even up to 8 h of continuous gas evolution. W2N nanowire arrays showed good photoactivity even at moderate bias. However, the pure W2N electrodes were unstable with respect to photocorrosion. The mixed phase W2N\u2013WO3 nanowires showed improvement in \u2026",

Here we show that this effect is a more general phenomenon and influences the properties of other semiconductors when the band lineup between the ambient and electronic states in the semiconductor is appropriate. We find that the luminescent intensities from GaN and ZnO change in different, but predictable, ways when exposed to HCl and NH3 vapors in humid air. The effect is reversible and has been observed on single crystals, nanowires, flakes, and powders. These observations are explained by electron exchange between the oxygen electrochemical redox couple in an adsorbed water film and electronic states in the semiconductor.
