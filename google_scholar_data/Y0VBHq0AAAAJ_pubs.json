            "Black TiO2 nanoparticles with a crystalline core and amorphous-shell structure exhibit superior optoelectronic properties in comparison with pristine TiO2. The fundamental mechanisms underlying these enhancements, however, remain unclear, largely due to the inherent complexities and limitations of powder materials. Here, we fabricate TiO2 homojunction films consisting of an oxygen-deficient amorphous layer on top of a highly crystalline layer, to simulate the structural\/functional configuration of black TiO2 nanoparticles. Metallic conduction is achieved at the crystalline\u2013amorphous homointerface via electronic interface reconstruction, which we show to be the main reason for the enhanced electron transport of black TiO2. This work not only achieves an unprecedented understanding of black TiO2 but also provides a new perspective for investigating carrier generation and transport behavior at oxide interfaces \u2026",

We show that, under direct lattice matching framework, large and uniform vertical strain up to 2% can be achieved to significantly modify the magnetic anisotropy, magnetism, and magnetotransport properties in heteroepitaxial nanoscaffold films, over a few hundred nanometers in thickness. Comprehensive designing principles of large vertical strain have been proposed. Phase-field simulations not only reveal the strain distribution but also suggest that the ultimate strain is related to the vertical interfacial area and interfacial dislocation density. By changing the nanoscaffold density and dimension, the strain and the magnetic properties can be tuned.

The electronic transport properties and magnetic behaviors of these films are strongly dependent on the miscut angles. With increasing the miscut angle, the transport property of the film changes from semiconducting to semimetallic, which results most probably from the locally strained domains induced by the surface step terraces. In addition, a very large magnetoresistance (34% at 60 K) was achieved for the 0.5\u00b0-miscut film, which is \u223c30% larger than that for the film grown on the regular (001) SrTiO3 substrates.",

Notably, there have been tremendous efforts to understand the effect of changes in oxygen content on the properties of perovskite thin films that are not composed of cations with multiple valance states. Here, we study the effect of oxygen vacancies on structural and electrical properties in epitaxial thin films of SrFeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SFO), where SFO is a compound with multiple valance states at the B site. Various annealing treatments are used to produce different oxygen contents in the films, which has resulted in significant structural changes in the fully strained SFO films. The out-of-plane lattice parameter and tetragonality increase with decreasing oxygen concentration, indicating the crystal structure is closely related to the oxygen content. Importantly, variation of the oxygen content in the films \u2026",

The structural and electrical properties of SFO thin films are monitored with time in different atmospheres at room temperature, showing time-dependent crystal structure and electrical conductivity. The increased out-of-plane lattice parameter and resistivity over time are associated with the increased oxygen vacancies density in SFO thin films. The epitaxial strain plays an important role in determining the initial resistivity, and the sample environment determines the trend of resistivity change over time. An amorphous Al2O3 passivation layer has been found to be effective in stabilizing the structure and electrical properties of SFO thin films.

The saturated magnetization shows a drastic increase and resistivity is significantly reduced in the ozone annealed samples, indicating the strong coupling between physical properties and oxygen content.
