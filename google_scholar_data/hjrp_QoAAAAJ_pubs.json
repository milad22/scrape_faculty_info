            "Conventional optical components are limited to size scales much larger than the wavelength of light, as changes to the amplitude, phase and polarization of the electromagnetic fields are accrued gradually along an optical path. However, advances in nanophotonics have produced ultrathin, so-called \u2018flat\u2019optical components that beget abrupt changes in these properties over distances significantly shorter than the free-space wavelength 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Although high optical losses still plague many approaches 9, phonon polariton (PhP) materials have demonstrated long lifetimes for sub-diffractional modes 10, 11, 12, 13 in comparison to plasmon-polariton-based nanophotonics. We experimentally observe a threefold improvement in polariton lifetime through isotopic enrichment of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Commensurate increases in the polariton propagation length are demonstrated via direct imaging of \u2026",

            "The terahertz spectral regime, ranging from about 0.1\u201315 THz, is one of the least explored yet most technologically transformative spectral regions. One current challenge is to develop efficient and compact terahertz emitters\/detectors with a broadband and gapless spectrum that can be tailored for various pump photon energies. Here we demonstrate efficient single-cycle broadband THz generation, ranging from about 0.1\u20134 THz, from a thin layer of split-ring resonators with few tens of nanometers thickness by pumping at the telecommunications wavelength of 1.5 \u03bcm (200 THz). The terahertz emission arises from exciting the magnetic-dipole resonance of the split-ring resonators and quickly decreases under off-resonance pumping. This, together with pump polarization dependence and power scaling of the terahertz emission, identifies the role of optically induced nonlinear currents in split-ring resonators. We also \u2026",

From the decay of the transient anti-Stokes scattering of the G-mode following ultrafast excitation, we measured a lifetime of 2.2\u00b10.1 ps for zone-center optical phonons. We also observed a transient stiffening of G-mode phonons, an effect attributed to the reduction of the electron-phonon coupling for high electronic temperatures.",

The measurements are performed using a pump-probe Raman scattering scheme with femtosecond laser pulses. For nanotubes, measured over a temperature range of 6 K\u2013700 K, we observe little temperature dependence of the decay rate below room temperature. Above 300 K, the decay rate increases from 0.8 to 1.7 ps\u2212 1. The decay rates observed for graphite range from 0.5 to 0.8 ps\u2212 1 for temperatures from 300 K\u2013700 K.

Here, we observe a more than 10\u00d7 enhancement in the indirect band gap photoluminescence of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) deposited on various metals (e.g., Cu, Au, Ag), while the direct band gap emission remains unchanged. We believe the main mechanism of light emission arises from photoexcited hot electrons in the metal that are injected into the conduction band of MoS2 and WSe2 and subsequently recombine radiatively with minority holes in the TMDC. Since the conduction band at the K-point is 0.5 eV higher than at the \u03a3-point, a lower Schottky barrier exists for the \u03a3-point band, making \u2026",
