            "Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin and comprise the structural building blocks of the living eukaryotic genome. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) has long been used to delineate nucleosomal organization. Microarray-based nucleosome mapping experiments in yeast chromatin have revealed regularly-spaced translational phasing of nucleosomes. These data have been used to train computational models of sequence-directed nuclesosome positioning, which have identified ubiquitous strong intrinsic nucleosome positioning signals. Here, we successfully apply this approach to nucleosome positioning experiments from human chromatin. The predictions made by the human-trained and yeast-trained models are strongly correlated, suggesting a shared mechanism for sequence-based determination of nucleosome occupancy. In addition, we observed striking complementarity between classifiers trained on experimental data from weakly versus heavily digested MNase samples. In the former case, the resulting model accurately identifies nucleosome-forming sequences; in the latter, the classifier excels at identifying nucleosome-free regions. Using this model we are able to identify several characteristics of nucleosome-forming and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. First, by combining results from each classifier applied de novo across the human ENCODE regions, the classifier reveals distinct sequence composition and periodicity features of nucleosome-forming and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Short runs of dinucleotide repeat appear as a hallmark of nucleosome-disfavoring sequences, while nucleosome \u2026",

            " Motivation: Alternative splicing is currently seen to explain the vast disparity between the number of predicted genes in the human genome and the highly diverse proteome. The mapping of expressed sequences tag (EST) consensus sequences derived from the GeneNest database onto the genome provides an efficient way of predicting exon\u2013intron boundaries, gene structure and alternative splicing events. However, the alternative splicing events are obscured by a large number of putatively artificial exon boundaries arising due to genomic contamination or alignment errors. The current work describes a methodology to associate quality values to the predicted exon\u2013intron boundaries. High quality exon\u2013intron boundaries are used to predict constitutive and alternative splicing ranked by confidence values, aiming to facilitate large-scale analysis of alternative splicing and splicing in general \u2026",

            "Alternative splicing contributes significantly to the complexity of the human transcriptome and proteome. Computational prediction of alternative splice isoforms are usually based on EST sequences that also allow to approximate the expression pattern of the related transcripts. However, the limited number of tissues represented in the EST data as well as the different cDNA construction protocols may influence the predictive capacity of ESTs to unravel tissue-specifically expressed transcripts. We predict tissue and tumor specific splice isoforms based on the genomic mapping (SpliceNest) of the EST consensus sequences and library annotation provided in the GeneNest database. We further ascertain the potentially rare tissue specific transcripts as the ones represented only by ESTs derived from normalized libraries. A subset of the predicted tissue and tumor specific isoforms are then validated via RT-PCR experiments over a spectrum of 40 tissue types. Our strategy revealed 427 genes with at least one tissue specific transcript as well as 1120 genes showing tumor specific isoforms. While our experimental evaluation of computationally predicted tissue-specific isoforms revealed a high success rate in confirming the expression of these isoforms in the respective tissue, the strategy frequently failed to detect the expected restricted expression pattern. The analysis of putative lowly expressed transcripts using normalized cDNA libraries suggests that our ability to detect tissue-specific isoforms strongly depends on the expression level of the respective transcript as well as on the sensitivity of the experimental methods.

            "Nucleosome occupancy plays a key role in regulating access to eukaryotic genomes. Although various chromatin regulatory complexes are known to regulate nucleosome occupancy, the role of DNA sequence in this regulation remains unclear, particularly in mammals. To address this problem, we measured nucleosome distribution at high temporal resolution in human cells at hundreds of genes during the reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma\u2013associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We show that nucleosome redistribution peaks at 24 h post-KSHV reactivation and that the nucleosomal redistributions are widespread and transient. To clarify the role of DNA sequence in these nucleosomal redistributions, we compared the genes with altered nucleosome distribution to a sequence-based computer model and in vitro\u2013assembled nucleosomes. We demonstrate that both the predicted model and the assembled nucleosome \u2026",
