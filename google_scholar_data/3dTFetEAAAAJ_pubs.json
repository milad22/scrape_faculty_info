            "The relativistic dynamics of an electron submitted to the three-dimensional field of a focused, ultrahigh-intensity laser pulse are studied numerically. The diffracting field in vacuum is modeled by the paraxial propagator and exactly satisfies the Lorentz gauge condition everywhere. In rectangular coordinates, the electromagnetic field is Fourier transformed into transverse and longitudinal wave packets, and diffraction is described through the different phase shifts accumulated by the various Fourier components, as constrained by the dispersion relation. In cylindrical geometry, the radial dependence of the focusing wave is described as a continuous spectrum of Bessel functions and can be obtained by using Hankel\u2019s integral theorem. To define the boundary conditions for this problem, the beam profile is matched to a Gaussian-Hermite distribution at focus, where the wave front is planar. Plane-wave dynamics are \u2026",

A laser pulse heats a 100 nm thick Al film which cools by conduction into a GaAs substrate. The top 120\u2013250 nm of the GaAs substrate is doped with In to create a buried layer with a distinct lattice constant. The cooling of the Al film is monitored by time-domain thermoreflectance and, in the second set of experiments, the heating and cooling of the GaAs: In buried layer are monitored by time-resolved x-ray diffraction. The combination of these data shows that thermal transport by ballistic phonons accounts for nearly 20% of the heat flow across the buried layer on nanosecond time scales.",

The IFEL concept has been demonstrated as a viable vacuum laser acceleration process; it is shown here that by using an ultrashort, ultrahigh-intensity drive laser pulse, the IFEL interaction bandwidth and accelerating gradient are increased considerably, thus yielding large energy gains. Using a chirped pulse and negative dispersion focusing optics allows one to take further advantage of the laser optical bandwidth and produce a chromatic line focus maximizing the gradient. The combination of these novel ideas results in a compact vacuum laser accelerator capable of accelerating picosecond electron bunches with a high gradient (GeV\/m) and very low energy spread.",

To formally demonstrate that electrons can indeed be accelerated in vacuum by focusing or diffracting electromagnetic waves, the interaction between a point charge and coherent dipole radiation is studied in detail. The corresponding four-potential exactly satisfies both Maxwell\u2019s equations and the Lorentz gauge condition everywhere, and is analytically tractable. It is found that in the far-field region, where the field distribution closely approximates that of a plane wave, we recover the Lawson-Woodward result, while net acceleration is obtained in the near-field region.

            "Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used to observe the transient species generated by one-photon detachment of an electron from aqueous bromide. The K-edge spectrum of the short-lived Br0 atom exhibits a resonant 1s-4p transition that is absent for the Br\u2212 precursor. The strong 1s-4p resonance suggests that there is very little charge transfer from the solvent to the open-shell atom, whereas weak oscillations above the absorption edge indicate that the solvent shell around a neutral Br0 atom is defined primarily by hydrophobic interactions. These conclusions are in agreement with Monte Carlo and quantum chemical simulations of the solvent structure.",
