            "When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect 1, 2 dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin\u2013orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit 3, 4, 5, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields 6. Bulk Bi 1-x Sb x single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates 7, 8 for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator 9, 10, 11. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
