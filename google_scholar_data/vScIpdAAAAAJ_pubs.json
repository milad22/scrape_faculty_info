            "A particle model of energetic electron transport in sputtering magnetron discharges is presented. The model assumes time\u2010independent magnetic and electric fields and supposes that scattering by neutral atoms is the dominant transport mechanism. Without scattering, we find that some orbits are confined indefinitely. Using the differential cross sections for elastic, excitation, and ionization collisions in argon, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the electrons emitted by ion bombardment of a planar magnetron cathode to predict the spatial distribution of ionization. We find good agreement with experimental measurements of the radial profile of ion flux to the cathode and of the axial profile of optical emission.",
