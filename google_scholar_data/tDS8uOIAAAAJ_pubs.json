            "Hybrid metal\u2010ion capacitors (MICs) (M stands for Li or Na) are designed to deliver high energy density, rapid energy delivery, and long lifespan. The devices are composed of a battery anode and a supercapacitor cathode, and thus become a tradeoff between batteries and supercapacitors. In the past two decades, tremendous efforts have been put into the search for suitable electrode materials to overcome the kinetic imbalance between the battery\u2010type anode and the capacitor\u2010type cathode. Recently, some transition\u2010metal compounds have been found to show pseudocapacitive characteristics in a nonaqueous electrolyte, which makes them interesting high\u2010rate candidates for hybrid MIC anodes. Here, the material design strategies in Li\u2010ion and Na\u2010ion capacitors are summarized, with a focus on pseudocapacitive oxide anodes (Nb2O5, MoO3, etc.), which provide a new opportunity to obtain a higher power \u2026",

It was found that the dispersion of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets within composites was key for achieving an excellent capacitive performance of the samples. However, the mass ratio of ZnO to rGO determined whether rGO sheets within composites were dispersed or agglomerated. The composite achieved homogeneous incorporation of rGO sheets within the ZnO matrix when the mass ratio of ZnO to rGO was equal to 93.3:6.7. This composite, in which the weight percent of rGO was only 6.7%, appeared in the SEM images to be almost entirely filled with rGO sheets coated by ZnO and exhibited high specific capacitance and excellent cycling ability \u2026",
