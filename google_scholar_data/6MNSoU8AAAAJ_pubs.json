Suspension \u223c150 nm above a Si\/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene.",

It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.",

Unlike conventional solids where electrons are described with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, electronic excitations in graphene are governed by the Dirac hamiltonian 1. Some of the intriguing electronic properties of graphene, such as massless Dirac quasiparticles with linear energy\u2013momentum dispersion, have been confirmed by recent observations 2, 3, 4, 5. Here, we report an infrared spectromicroscopy study of charge dynamics in graphene integrated in gated devices. Our measurements verify the expected characteristics of graphene and, owing to the previously unattainable accuracy of infrared experiments, also uncover significant departures of the quasiparticle dynamics from predictions made for Dirac fermions in idealized, free-standing graphene.

In particular, the presence of the \u03bd= 0,\u00b11 QH plateaus indicates that the Landau level at the charge neutral Dirac point splits into four sublevels, lifting sublattice and spin degeneracy. The QH effect at \u03bd=\u00b14 is investigated in a tilted magnetic field and can be attributed to lifting of the spin degeneracy of the n= 1 Landau level.",
