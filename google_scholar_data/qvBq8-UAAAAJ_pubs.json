In order to test the theory, we perform event-driven molecular simulations of a two-dimensional gas of inelastic hard disks, driven by contact with a heat bath. Even for strong dissipation, high densities, and small numbers of particles, we find that continuum theory describes the system well. With a bath that heats the gas homogeneously, strong velocity correlations produce a slightly smaller energy loss due to inelastic collisions than that predicted by kinetic theory. With an inhomogeneous heat bath, thermal or velocity gradients are induced. Determination of the resulting fluxes allows calculation of the thermal conductivity and shear viscosity, which are compared to the predictions of granular kinetic theory, and which can be used in continuum modeling of granular flows.

Avalanches provide a mechanism for the stretching and folding needed to mix granular solids. However, unlike fluids, when particles dissimilar in size, density, or shape flow, they can spontaneously demix or segregate. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we track the transport of granular solids in a slowly rotating tube both with and without segregation effects. Compared with experiments in a 2-dimensional rotating disk partially filled with colored particles, the mixing kinematics and the granular pattern formation in a tube are changed by an axial flow instability. From simple physical principles we argue how size and density segregation mechanisms can be made to cancel, allowing good mixing of dissimilar particles, and we show experiments verifying this.

            "The magnetization in hyperpolarized gas (HP) MRI is generated by laser polarization that is independent of the magnet and imaging process. As a consequence, there is no equilibrium magnetization during the image acquisition. The competing processes of gas inflow and depolarization of the spins lead to large changes in signal as one samples k\u2010space. A model is developed of dynamic changes in polarization of hyperpolarized 3He during infusion and in vivo imaging of the lung and verified experimentally in a live guinea pig. Projection encoding is used to measure the view\u2010to\u2010view variation with temporal resolution <4 ms. Large excitation angles effectively sample the magnetization in the early stages of inflow, highlighting larger airways, while smaller excitation angles produce images of the more distal spaces. The work provides a basis for pulse sequences designed to effectively exploit HP MRI in the lung.",
