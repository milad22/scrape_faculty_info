STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Data relating to all blood donations to the American Red Cross have been consolidated into a single database. The prevalence of confirmed\u2010positive test results for HBsAg, HCV, HIV, and HTLV were evaluated for each year for first\u2010time donors from 1995 through 2001. Incidence rates for these infections were evaluated among repeat donors having at least two donations in a 2\u2010year period. The frequencies of HIV\u20101 RNA\u2010 and HCV RNA\u2010positive, seronegative donations were assessed for first\u2010time and repeat donations.

This study analyzes temporal trends of these two infections since NAT introduction.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donation data from 1999 to 2008 were analyzed; each donation was tested for antibodies and viral RNA for HIV and HCV. Incidence for first\u2010time (FT) donors was derived by multiplying that among repeat (RP) donors by the ratio of NAT yield rates between FT and RP donors. Incidence for all donors was the weighted mean based on percentage of FT and RP donors. Residual risk (RR) was determined using the window\u2010period model.RESULTS: During the 10\u2010year period approximately 66 million donations were screened with 32 HIV (1:2 million) and 244 HCV (1:270,000) NAT yield donations identified.

The first reports on the feasibility of routine blood donation NAT screening were published in 1998\u2044 99, followed by wide-scale implementation or mandated NAT testing in multiple countries over the subsequent several years [1\u20135]. Although studies demonstrated that NAT testing could efficiently detect serologically negative donors who were infected with all three major transfusion-transmitted viruses (HCV, HIV-1 and HBV), most countries initially mandated NAT testing only for HCV or for HCV and HIV-1. Thus, despite the cost and logistical challenges to blood banks that tried to establish NAT testing on a routine basis, HCV and HIV-1 NAT testing expanded rapidly in the early 90s in many countries.

            "BACKGROUND: Plasma components from female donors were responsible for most cases of transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI) reported to the American Red Cross (ARC) between 2003 and 2005. Consequently, we began preferentially distributing plasma from male donors for transfusion in 2006 and evaluated the effect on reported TRALI cases in the ensuing 2 years.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Suspected TRALI cases reported to the ARC Hemovigilance Program in calendar years (CY) 2006, 2007, and 2008 are described. Any case involving a fatality was also independently reviewed by three ARC physicians and classified as probable TRALI or not TRALI.RESULTS: The percentage of plasma collected from male donors and distributed for transfusion increased each year from 55% in CY2006 to 79% in CY2007 and 95% in CY2008.

            "BACKGROUND: This study used two approaches to estimate the current incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a US donor population.METHODS: HBV incidence was estimated through the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) yield approach and the seroconversion method. Residual risk was estimated by the incidence\u2013window period model. HBsAg yield refers to an HBsAg confirmed\u2010positive, antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (anti\u2010HBc)\u2013nonreactive donation, adjusted for false\u2010positive neutralization results. The number of HBsAg\u2010seroconverting repeat donors divided by total number of person\u2010years of evaluation or the HBsAg yield rate divided by HBsAg yield window gave rise to incidence estimates.RESULTS: The seroconversion and the yield approach, respectively, gave an incidence estimate of 3.41 or 3.43 per 105 person\u2010years.
