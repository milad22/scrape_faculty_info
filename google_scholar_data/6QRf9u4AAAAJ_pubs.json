Bjorken scaling implies that the quarks interact weakly. An asymptotically free gauge theory allows realistic calculations taking full account of strong interactions.",

This results in a new spin-dependent fragmentation function that acts at the twist-2 level. One example of a process where it contributes is semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering with a transversely polarized nucleon target but with an unpolarized electron beam. This process is treated in detail. Another process in the cross section for singly polarized hadron-hadron scattering when two high-p \u22a5 hadrons are measured in the final state and are close to back-to-back in azimuth. The new fragmentation function is sensitive to the coupling of the fragmentation process to (spontaneous) chiral symmetry breaking.",

We specify the required N = 0 coefficients, employing the order \u03b1s2 results of Kodaira and Trentadue and of Davies and Stirling. We then show how the expression should be modified to deal with current energy scales. We also discuss the connection between low-QT and high-QT formulae.",

This generalizes previous work on vector meson production in the diffractive region of small x. The amplitude is expressed in terms of off-diagonal generalizations of the usual parton densities. The full theorem applies to all kinds of mesons and not just to vector mesons. The parton densities used include not only the ordinary parton density, but also the helicity density (g 1 or \u0394 q) and the transversity density (h 1 or \u03b4 q), and these can be probed by measuring the polarization of the produced mesons with unpolarized protons.",

            "Recently, Brodsky, Hwang and Schmidt have proposed a new mechanism that gives a transverse spin symmetry at leading twist in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering. I show that the new mechanism is compatible with factorization and is due to a transverse-spin asymmetry in the kT distribution of quarks in a hadron (the \u201cSivers asymmetry\u201d). An earlier proof that the Sivers asymmetry vanishes because of time-reversal invariance is invalidated by the path-ordered exponential of the gluon field in the operator definition of parton densities. Instead, the time-reversal argument shows that the Sivers asymmetry is reversed in sign in hadron-induced hard processes (e.g., Drell\u2013Yan), thereby violating naive universality of parton densities. Previous phenomenology with time-reversal-odd parton densities is therefore validated.",
