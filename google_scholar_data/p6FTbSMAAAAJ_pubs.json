            "Hydrogen-terminated boron-doped diamond (BDD) has emerged as a unique electrode material displaying, among other properties, extraordinary low reactivity in aqueous electrolytes1, 2 over a wide potential range. 2 Electrochemical studies of BDD in nonaqueous solvents would offer an even larger voltage window and, thereby, the possibility of investigating an expanded array of reactions without interference from processes derived from electrolyte decomposition. This paper presents cyclic voltammetry of hydrogen-terminated BDD films, grown on diamond macles, 3 in LiClO4-poly (ethyleneoxide)(PEO) and LiI\/PEO solid polymer electrolytes. Diamond is an ideal substrate material as its lack of chemical reactivity may avoid ambiguities in the interpretation of the electrochemical data derived from reactions involving other supports, which either form alloys, such as silicon, 4 or promote lithium underpotential \u2026",

Defects were introduced on selected sections of HOPG(bp) surfaces via Ar+ bombardment by employing specially designed masks. The effect of such defects on the electronic and structural nature of the Pt clusters formed was examined by evaporating the metal simultaneously on both damaged and nominally pristine sections of HOPG(bp). HRSEM and STM images of Pt deposits formed at 300 K on pristine HOPG(bp) were found to display three-dimensional fractal-type aggregates. Image analysis of such Pt clusters gave a fractal dimension DL=1.7 for Pt \u2026",

The results obtained for the underpotential (UPD) and bulk deposition of Al on Au were found to be very similar to those reported in the literature for measurements carried out under 1 atm of an inert gas in a glovebox.
