            "We review the physical properties of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) of the type AII1\u2212xMnxBVI (e.g., Cd1\u2212xMnxSe, Hg1\u2212xMnxTe). Crystallographic properties are discussed first, with emphasis on the common structural features which these materials have as a result of tetrahedral bonding. We then describe the band structure of the AII1\u2212xMnxBVI alloys in the absence of an external magnetic field, stressing the close relationship of the sp electron bands in these materials to the band structure of the nonmagnetic AIIBVI \u2018\u2018parent\u2019\u2019 semiconductors. In addition, the characteristics of the narrow (nearly localized) band arising from the half\u2010filled Mn 3d5 shells are described, along with their profound effect on the optical properties of DMS. We then describe our present understanding of the magnetic properties of the AII1\u2212xMnxBVI alloys. In particular, we discuss the mechanism of the Mn++\u2010Mn++ exchange, which \u2026",

When the junction is irradiated with a radiofrequency f 0 in the absence of an external magnetic field, quantized voltage steps (Shapiro steps) with a height \u0394 V= h f 0\/2e are observed, as is expected for conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is carried by charge-2e Cooper pairs.

The concentrations of free holes determined by electrochemical capacitance-voltage profiling and of uncompensated Mn 2+ spins determined from superconducting quantum-interference device magnetization measurements are found to depend on the concentration of unstable defects involving highly mobile Mn interstitials. This leads to large variations in T C of Ga 1\u2212 x Mn x As when it is annealed at different temperatures in a narrow temperature range. The fact that annealing under various conditions has failed to produce Curie temperatures above\u223c 110 K is attributed to the existence of an upper limit on the free hole concentration in low-temperature-grown Ga 1\u2212 x Mn x As.",

These materials are ternary semiconductor alloys whose lattice is made up in part of substitutional magnetic ions. Cd1\u2212xMnxTe and Hg1\u2212xMnxTe are examples of such systems. As semiconductors, these alloys display interesting and important properties, such as the variation of the energy gap and of effective mass with composition. They also exhibit magnetic properties which are interesting in their own right, e.g., a low temperature spin glass transition and magnon excitations. Most importantly, however, the presence of substitutional magnetic ions in these alloys leads to spin\u2013spin exchange interaction between the localized magnetic moments and the band electrons. This in turn has rather important consequences on band structure and on donor \u2026",

            "The current state of information technology accentuates the dichotomy between processing and storage of information, with logical operations carried out by charge-based devices and non-volatile memory based on magnetic materials. The main obstacle for a wider use of magnetic materials for information processing is the lack of efficient control of magnetization. Reorientation of magnetic domains is conventionally carried out by non-local external magnetic fields or by externally polarized currents 1, 2, 3. The efficiency of the latter approach is enhanced in materials where ferromagnetism is carrier-mediated 4, because in such materials the control of carrier polarization provides an alternative means for manipulating the orientation of magnetic domains. In some crystalline conductors, the charge current couples to the spins by means of intrinsic spin\u2013orbit interactions, thus generating non-equilibrium electron spin \u2026",
