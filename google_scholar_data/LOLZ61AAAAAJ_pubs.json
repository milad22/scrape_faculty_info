            "Using a new parallel computing technique, we have run the largest cosmic string simulations ever performed. Our results confirm the existence of a long transient period where a nonscaling distribution of small loops is produced at lengths depending on the initial correlation scale. As time passes, this initial population gives way to the true scaling regime, where loops of size approximately equal to one-twentieth the horizon distance become a significant component. We observe similar behavior in matter and radiation eras, as well as in flat space. In the matter era, the scaling population of large loops becomes the dominant component; we expect this to eventually happen in the other eras as well.",

This scenario is well motivated from grand unified theories and string-theoretic models with an inflationary phase below the grand unified theories\/string scale. The network initially evolves according to a scaling solution, but with breakage events resulting from confined monopoles (beads) being pair produced and accelerated apart. We find these ultrarelativistic beads to be a potent source of gravitational wave bursts, detectable by initial LIGO, advanced LIGO, and LISA. Indeed, advanced LIGO could observe bursts from strings with tensions as low as G \u03bc\u223c 10\u2212 12.

Traditional shooting methods fail because of the extreme non-linearity of field evolution over a macroscopic distance as a function of initial conditions. Minimization methods tend to become either slow or imprecise for larger numbers of fields due to their dependence on the high dimensionality of discretized function spaces. We present a new method for finding solutions which is both very efficient and able to cope with the non-linearities. Our method directly integrates the equations of motion except at a small number of junction points, so we do not need to introduce a discrete domain for our functions. The method, based on multiple shooting, typically finds solutions involving three fields in around a minute, and can find solutions for eight fields in about an hour.

Recent investigations have suggested modifications to the usual picture of false vacuum decay that leads to efficient and rapid tunneling in the landscape when certain conditions are met. This can be due to stringy effects (e.g. tunneling via the DBI action), or effects arising from the presence of multiple vacua (e.g. resonance tunneling). In this paper we discuss both DBI tunneling and resonance tunneling. We provide a QFT treatment of resonance tunneling using the Schr\u00f6dinger functional approach. We also show how DBI tunneling for supercritical barriers can naturally lead to conditions suitable for resonance tunneling. We argue, using basic ideas from percolation theory, that tunneling can be rapid in a landscape where a typical vacuum has multiple decay channels, and discuss various \u2026",
