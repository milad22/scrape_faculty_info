            "THE ability of magnetotactic bacteria to orientate and navigate along geomagnetic field lines is due to the controlled intracellular deposition of the iron oxide mineral, magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) 1, 2. The function and crystal chemical specificity of this mineral has been considered to be unique amongst the prokaryotes 3. Moreover, the bacterial production of magnetite may represent a significant contribution to the natural remanent magnetism of sediments 4, 5. Here we report, the intracellular biomineralization of single crystals of the ferrimagnetic iron sulphide, greigite (Fe 3 S 4), in a multicellular magnetotactic bacterium common in brackish, sulphide-rich water and sediment. We show that these crystals are often aligned in chains and associated with single crystals of the non-magnetic mineral, iron pyrite (FeS 2). Our results have important implications for understanding biomineralization processes and magnetotaxis in \u2026",

            "Diet plays an important role in maintaining health. Among the different products delivering essential nutrients to the body, an egg has arguably a special place, being a rich and balanced source of essential amino and fatty acids as well some minerals and vitamins. This paper focuses on the benefits to the consumer of improving the nutritional quality of eggs by enhancing levels of anti-oxidants and n-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The advantages of simultaneous enrichment of eggs with vitamin E, carotenoids, selenium and DHA include better stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during egg storage and cooking, high availability of such nutrients as vitamin E and carotenoids, absence of off-taste and an improved anti-oxidant and n-3 status of people consuming these eggs.

Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we have studied magnetic particles isolated from ethmoid tissue of the sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka. Low-magnification electron micrographs showed chains containing up to 58 (median = 21\u201325) electron-dense particles that were held together by intimately attached organic material. The particle size range was 25\u201360 nm with a mean of 48 nm and a standard deviation of 8.5 nm. Elemental analysis, by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA), electron diffraction patterns and HRTEM lattice images, showed that many of the particles were structurally well-ordered and \u2026",

            "Necrotic enteritis is a disease in poultry that can have a high economic and animal welfare cost, and has become increasingly prevalent in the European Union due to factors such as the removal of antibiotic growth promoters and the requirement to exclude animal by-products from diet formulations. Estimates of the prevalence of necrotic enteritis vary widely (1\u201340 %) as does the cost of the disease, and the sub-clinical form may be the most important manifestation of the disease as this is likely to go undetected and hence untreated. An outbreak of necrotic enteritis is primarily associated with rapid proliferation of the anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, leading to gaseous extension of the small intestine, the production of one or more exotoxins, and enteric toxicosis. The molecular progression of the disease is quite complex and at the bacterial level involves quorum sensing, toxin production \u2026",

Significant activities of the major isozymes of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which protect against the peroxidation associated with high degree of fatty acid unsaturation, were found in spermatozoa from all species. The seminal plasma also had these activities and showed additional mechanisms for protecting spermatozoa from peroxidation.

Antioxidant systems are expressed in the embryonic tissues and are responsible for maintaining antioxidant protection during different stages of embryoonic development, in particular at hatching time when oxidative stress is highly pronounced (Surai, 1999). The antioxidant systems of the avian embryo are based on the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (Surai, 1999a; Surai, 2000a), and fat-soluble and water-soluble natural antioxidants (Surai, 1999).

All products were added at a rate of 2%, apart from marigold extract which was added at a rate of 0\u00b72%.3.\u2003Visual assessment of yolk colour (Roche colour fan) showed a stabilised yolk colour of 1\u00b76, 7\u00b77, 8\u00b75, 8\u00b78 and 10\u00b76 for the control, PX, TP, MG and MG\u2009+\u2009TP treatments, respectively.4.\u2003The total carotenoid concentration of the egg yolks were 2\u00b72, 22\u00b74, 4\u00b71, 39\u00b70 and 37\u00b77\u2009\u00b5g \u2026",

Broiler breeders (n = 352) were fed 1 of 4 diets: SO (soybean oil with no added Se), SO with Se (SO+Se), fish oil (FO), or FO and Se (FO+Se). Eggs from prepeak (23 wk) and peak production (27 wk) breeders were stored for 14 d under typical (15 \u00b0 C, 78% RH) conditions. Eggs were analyzed for albumen Haugh units (HU) and pH, shell characteristics, egg component weight, Se content, and fatty acid (FA) profile. The efficiency of transfer of Se into the egg was greater in low Se treatments compared with in high Se treatments. The majority of Se from the low Se treatments was deposited in the yolk, whereas in high Se treatments, the Se was deposited evenly in the yolk and albumen. In the low Se treatments, the Se content of yolk and albumen was lower \u2026",
