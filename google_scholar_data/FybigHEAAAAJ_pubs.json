            "Lattice-mismatch strains are widely known to control nanoscale pattern formation in heteroepitaxy, but such effects have not been exploited in colloidal nanocrystal growth. We demonstrate a colloidal route to synthesizing CdS-Ag2S nanorod superlattices through partial cation exchange. Strain induces the spontaneous formation of periodic structures. Ab initio calculations of the interfacial energy and modeling of strain energies show that these forces drive the self-organization of the superlattices. The nanorod superlattices exhibit high stability against ripening and phase mixing. These materials are tunable near-infrared emitters with potential applications as nanometer-scale optoelectronic devices.",

The practical realization of these opportunities requires systematic generation and classification of the relevant computational data by high-throughput methods.

By using band-corrected pseudopotential density functional theory calculations, we study how the band gap, optical absorption, and carrier localization can be controlled by forming quantum-well-like and nanowire-based heterostructures of ZnO\/ZnS and ZnO\/ZnTe. In the case of ZnO\/ZnS core\/shell nanowires, which can be synthesized using existing methods, we obtain a band gap of 2.07 eV, which corresponds to a Shockley\u2212Quiesser efficiency limit of 23%. On the basis of these nanowire results, we propose that ZnO\/ZnS core\/shell nanowires can be used as photovoltaic devices with organic polymer semiconductors as p-channel contacts.      ",

We demonstrate that the selectivity for cation exchange to take place at different facets of the nanocrystal plays an important role in determining the resulting morphology of the binary heterostructure. In the case of copper(I) (Cu+) cation exchange in cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods, the reaction starts preferentially at the ends of the nanorods such that copper sulfide (Cu2S) grows inward from either end. The resulting morphology is very different from the striped pattern obtained in our previous studies of silver(I) (Ag+) exchange in CdS nanorods where nonselective nucleation of silver sulfide (Ag2S) occurs (Robinson, R. D.; Sadtler, B.; Demchenko, D. O.; Erdonmez, C. K.; Wang, L.-W.; Alivisatos, A. P. Science 2007, 317, 355\u2212358). From interface formation energies calculated for \u2026",

In contrast to common isolated defects, the C N\u2212 O N complex is energetically favorable, and its calculated optical properties, such as absorption and emission energies, a zero phonon line, and the thermodynamic transition level, all show excellent agreement with measured luminescence data. Thus, by combining hybrid density functional theory and experimental measurements, we propose a solution to a long-standing problem of the GaN yellow luminescence.",

The YL band, related to transitions via the\u2212\/0 level of the same defect, has a maximum at 2.1 eV and can be observed only for some high-purity samples. However, in less pure GaN samples, where no GL band is observed, another YL band with a maximum at 2.2 eV dominates the photoluminescence spectrum. The latter is attributed to the C N O N complex.",

By tuning the width of the quantum well, the lowest resonant level can be moved into the energy interval where the density of states for minority spins is zero. This leads to a great enhancement of the magnetoresistance, which exhibits a strong maximum as a function of the quantum well width.

One of them is the green luminescence band (GL2) having a maximum at 2.35 eV which was observed previously in undoped GaN grown by molecular-beam epitaxy in Ga-rich conditions. The same PL band was observed in Mg-doped GaN, also grown in very Ga-rich conditions. The unique properties of the GL2 band allowed us to reliably identify it in different samples. The best candidate for the defect which causes the GL2 band is a nitrogen vacancy (V N). We propose that transitions of electrons from the conduction band to the+\/2+ transition level of the V N defect are responsible for the GL2 band in high-resistivity undoped and Mg-doped GaN.",
