A large number of empirical questions and hypotheses are developed that together make up an identity distinctive framework for the study of organizations, including the relationship of identity to the organizational life cycle. A new methodology, extended metaphor analysis, is proposed for studying dual and multiple identity organizations.

This preliminary study compares the degree to which family and nonfamily firms are socially responsible using data from 1991 to 2000 from the S&P 500. Two hundred sixty\u2013one firms (202 nonfamily and 59 family) appeared in the S&P 500 for the 10\u2013year period. Findings show that family firms are more socially responsible than nonfamily firms along several dimensions.

            "In the field of organizational identity, theory development has far outpaced theory testing. Specifically, several researchers have proposed identity-based models of organizational identification but few have operationalized and tested them. Furthermore, virtually no research has explored how members identify with multiple-identity organizations. This study addresses these gaps and makes three specific contributions to identity theory. First, we operationalize and test a model in which a member's organizational identification is conceptualized in terms of an identity comparison process, i.e., a cognitive comparison between what a member perceives the identity to be and what they think it should be. Second, we extend current thinking by operationalizing organizational identification in terms of multiple and competing identities. Third, as a theory-building exercise, we explore the possibility that a similar identity \u2026",

            "The study of organizations has moved beyond focusing on single organizations to an examination of populations oforganizations relating to their environments (Aldrich,! 979), but the development of concepts and datagathering methods appropriate to this level has been remarkably slow. Anthropologists, sociologists studying community structure, and politicai sociologists and economists studying power relations have shifted their ioci, with the putative unit of analysis becoming a net-Work rather than individual elements of a network (Mitchell, 1972; Perrucci and Pilisuk, 1970; Sheingold, 1973). Most studies of organization-environment interaction still focus on isolated organizations relating to their environments, with a few exceptions (Levine, 1972; Van de Ven et al., 1974). Network concepts, if \u00bad at all, are treated as metaphors rather than analyti-\u00bal tools. In this chapter it is argued that models and ethods are \u2026",
