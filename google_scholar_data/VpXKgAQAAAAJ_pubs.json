On this basis, we hypothesized that apoptosis in this cell type might be induced by angiotensin II (ANG II) through its interaction with the ANG II receptor. Purified ANG II induced dose-dependent apoptosis in both the human AEC-derived A549 cell line and in primary type II pneumocytes isolated from adult Wistar rats as detected by nuclear and chromatin morphology, caspase-3 activity, and increased binding of annexin V. Apoptosis also was induced in primary rat AECs by purified angiotensinogen. The nonselective ANG II-receptor antagonist saralasin completely abrogated \u2026",

TTX occludes the ion-permeation pathway at the outer vestibule of the channel. In addition to a critical guanidinium group, TTX possesses six hydroxyl groups, which appear to be important for toxin block. The nature of their interactions with the outer vestibule remains debatable, however. The C-11 hydroxyl (C-11 OH) has been proposed to interact with the channel through a hydrogen bond to a carboxyl group, possibly from domain IV. On the other hand, previous experiments suggest that TTX interacts most strongly with pore loops of domains I and II.

Despite fasting serum C\u2010peptide levels being an accurate and stable marker of endogenous insulin production used in patients with diabetes, it is unknown whether C\u2010peptide could serve as a marker of insulin resistance and predict outcomes in patients without diabetes.This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the NHANES\u20103 (1988\u20131994) survey with mortality follow\u2010up through December 31, 2006. Participants included 5153 subjects, 40 to 74 years of age with fasting glucose \u226570 mg\/dL, without diabetes by history or laboratory testing. Receiver\u2010operating\u2010curve analysis compared fasting C\u2010peptide against known insulin resistance measures such as fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, HOMA\u2010IR \u2026",

            "\u03bc-Conotoxin GIIIA (\u03bc-CTX) is a high-affinity ligand for the outer vestibule of selected isoforms of the voltage-gated Na+ channel. The detailed bases for the toxin\u2019s high affinity binding and isoform selectivity are unclear. The outer vestibule is lined by four pore-forming (P) loops, each with an acidic residue near the mouth of the vestibule. \u03bc-CTX has seven positively charged residues that may interact with these acidic P-loop residues. Using pair-wise alanine replacement of charged toxin and channel residues, in conjunction with double mutant cycle analysis, we determined coupling energies for specific interactions between each P-loop acidic residue and selected toxin residues to systematically establish quantitative restraints on the toxin orientation in the outer vestibule. Xenopus oocytes were injected with the mutant or native Na+ channel mRNA, and currents measured by two-electrode voltage clamp. Mutant \u2026",
