            "We place perturbative unitarity constraints on both the dimensionful and dimensionless parameters in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) Higgs Sector. These constraints, plus the requirement that the singlino and\/or Higgsino constitutes at least part of the observed dark matter relic abundance, generate upper bounds on the Higgs, neutralino and chargino mass spectrum. Requiring higher-order corrections to be no more than 41% of the tree-level value, we obtain an upper bound of 20 TeV for the heavy Higgses and 12 TeV for the charginos and neutralinos outside defined fine-tuned regions. If the corrections are no more than 20% of the tree-level value, the bounds are 7 TeV for the heavy Higgses and 5 TeV for the charginos and neutralinos. In all, by using the NMSSM as a template, we describe a method which replaces naturalness arguments with more rigorous perturbative unitarity \u2026",

            "In this paper we prove that the recursive (Knill) dimension of the join of two graphs has a simple formula in terms of the dimensions of the component graphs: . We use this formula to derive an expression for the Knill dimension of a graph from its minimum clique cover. A corollary of the formula is that a graph made of the arbitrary union of complete graphs  of the same order  will have dimension . We finish by finding lower and upper bounds on the Knill dimension of a graph in terms of its clique number.",
