The wave equation for the electromagnetic wave propagating in such a structure is solved in the framework of the Kronig\u2013Penney model. The frequency band structure of the 1D graphene-based photonic crystal is obtained analytically as a function of the filling factor and the thickness of the dielectric between the graphene stripes. The photonic frequency corresponding to the electromagnetic wave localized by a defect of the photonic crystal formed by an extra dielectric placed in the position of one stack of alternating graphene and dielectric stripes is obtained.",

We study Bose-Einstein condensation in the two-component system of dipolar A and B excitons. The effective mass, energy spectrum of the collective excitations, the sound velocity, and critical temperature are obtained for different TMDC materials. It is shown that in the Bogoliubov approximation, the sound velocity in the two-component dilute exciton Bose gas is always larger than in any one-component exciton system. The difference between the sound velocities for two-component and one-component dilute gases is caused by the fact that the sound velocity for a two-component system depends on the reduced mass of A and B excitons, which is always smaller than the individual mass of A or B exciton.

We find characteristic time scales, such as the minimal time to achieve fidelity 1, and the optimality of the approach within the iterative superadiabatic sequence. Specifically, we show that the population inversion in a two-level system, the splitting and cotunneling of two-interacting bosons, and the stirring of a Tonks-Girardeau gas on a ring to achieve mesoscopic superpositions of many-body rotating and nonrotating states can be significantly speeded up.",

The analytic solutions for the ring dark soliton are derived by using a transformation method. A shallow ring dark soliton is stable when the ring is slightly distorted, while for large deformation of the ring, vortex pairs appear and demonstrate different dynamical behaviors: the vortex pairs transform into dark lumplike solitons and revert to ring dark solitons periodically. Moreover, our results show that the dynamical evolution of the ring dark soliton can be dramatically affected by the Feshbach resonance, and the lifetime of the ring dark soliton can be greatly extended, which offers a useful method for observing ring dark solitons in future experiments.",
