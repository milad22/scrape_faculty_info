Given the topic and context specificity of PCK, this investigation was conducted in the context of the photosynthesis and heredity instruction of four teachers who were working at the same high school with the same curricular materials. Data sources included classroom observations, semi\u2010structured interviews, lesson plans, instructional materials, and students' work samples. Data were analyzed through three different approaches: (a) in\u2010depth analysis of explicit PCK, (b) enumerative approach, and (c) the constant comparative method. Data analysis indicated \u2026",

This study utilized a quantitative research method to investigate the correlation between a teacher\u2019s PCK level as measured by the PCK rubric (Park et al. 2008) and the degree to which his\/her classroom is reform-oriented as measured by RTOP (Sawada et al. 2002). Data included 33 instructional sessions of photosynthesis and heredity videotaped with 7 high school biology teachers. Each session was given a score on both the PCK rubric and RTOP by two independent raters. Results indicate that PCK score is significantly related to RTOP score in terms of both total score (r\u2009=\u2009.831, p\u2009<\u2009.01) and sub-component scores (ranging from r\u2009=\u2009.616 to .805, p\u2009<\u2009.01).

The participants included 835 fourth\u2010grade students and 416 11th\u2010grade students from four elementary schools and one high school in the United States. Students in treatment groups were asked to write three letters for exchange at the beginning\/during\/completion of an 8\u2010week teaching unit about force and motion. The structure of writing was based on three components of arguments: question, claim, and evidence. A comparison of the pre\u2010 and posttest results indicated that students who engaged in collaborative letter\u2010writing tasks performed better than students who did not.

This study aimed to examine how each pattern supports students' development of scientific knowledge through the construction and critique of arguments and what cognitive functions are associated with each pattern. To trace students' knowledge development over time using the four patterns, three students were selected as target subjects.
