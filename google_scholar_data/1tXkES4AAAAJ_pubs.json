            "The size of a planet is an observable property directly connected to the physics of its formation and evolution. We used precise radius measurements from the California-Kepler Survey to study the size distribution of 2025 Kepler planets in fine detail. We detect a factor of\u2265 2 deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1.5\u20132.0. This gap splits the population of close-in (P< 100 days) small planets into two size regimes:  and , with few planets in between. Planets in these two regimes have nearly the same intrinsic frequency based on occurrence measurements that account for planet detection efficiencies. The paucity of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 supports the emerging picture that close-in planets smaller than Neptune are composed of rocky cores measuring 1.5 or smaller with varying amounts of low-density gas that determine their total sizes.",

We calculate the weighted mean densities of planets in bins of 0.5 R\u2295 and identify a density maximum of 7.6 g cm\u20133 at 1.4 R\u2295. On average, planets with radii up to R P= 1.5 R\u2295 increase in density with increasing radius. Above 1.5 R\u2295, the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. Including the solar system terrestrial planets with the exoplanets below 1.5 R\u2295, we find \u03c1 P= 2.43+ 3.39 (R P\/R\u2295) g cm\u20133 for R P< 1.5 R\u2295, which is consistent with rocky compositions.

KOI-94 also hosts at least three smaller transiting planets, all of which were detected by the Kepler mission. With 26 radial velocities of KOI-94 from the WM Keck Observatory and a simultaneous fit to the Kepler light curve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is not inflated. Support for the planetary interpretation of the other three candidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timing variations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against false positives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within the photometric aperture.

Furthermore, the orbital period ratios are smaller in systems with smaller planets, suggesting that the patterns in planet sizes and spacing are linked through formation and\/or subsequent orbital dynamics.
