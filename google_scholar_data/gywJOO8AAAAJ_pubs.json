The normalized differential cross sections are measured separately for electron and muon decay channels as well as for their combination up to p T Z of 350 GeV for invariant dilepton masses 66 GeV< m \u2113 \u2113< 116 GeV. The measurement is compared to predictions of perturbative QCD and various event generators. The prediction of resummed QCD combined with fixed order perturbative QCD is found to be in good agreement with the data.",

For the free field realizations of N= 4 super Yang\u2013Mills theory in D= 4 and the (2, 0) tensor multiplet in D= 6, the ratio is bounded from above. The corresponding bounds are less stringent than the recently proposed Verlinde bound. We show that entropy bounds arise generically in CFTs in connection to monotonicity properties with respect to temperature changes of a generalized C-function. For strongly coupled CFTs with AdS duals, we show that the ratio obeys the Verlinde bound even in the presence of rotation. For such CFTs, we point out an intriguing resemblance in their thermodynamic formulas with the corresponding ones of two-dimensional CFTs. We show that simple scaling forms for the free energy and entropy of CFTs with AdS duals reproduce the thermodynamical properties of (D+ 1)-dimensional AdS \u2026",

We consider a general situation of single field inflation and show that the three point function involving two scalar modes and one tensor mode is uniquely determined, up to small corrections, by the conformal symmetries. Special conformal transformations play an important role in our analysis. Our result applies only to models where the inflaton sector also approximately preserves the full conformal group and shows that this three point function is a good way to test if special conformal invariance was preserved during inflation.",
