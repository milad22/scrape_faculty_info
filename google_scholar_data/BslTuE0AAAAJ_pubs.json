            "Ultrasound is an attractive modality for temperature monitoring because it is non-ionizing, convenient, inexpensive and has relatively simple signal processing requirements. This modality may be useful for temperature estimation if a temperature-dependent ultrasonic parameter can be identified, measured and calibrated. The most prominent methods for using ultrasound as a non-invasive thermometer exploit either (1) echo shifts due to changes in tissue thermal expansion and speed of sound (SOS), (2) variation in the attenuation coefficient or (3) change in backscattered energy from tissue inhomogeneities. The use of echo shifts has received the most attention in the last decade. By tracking scattering volumes and measuring the time shift of received echoes, investigators have been able to predict the temperature from a region of interest both theoretically and experimentally in phantoms, in isolated tissue regions \u2026",

            "Despite its common use in cancer treatment, radiotherapy has not yet entered the era of precision medicine, and there have been no approaches to adjust dose based on biological differences between or within tumours. We aimed to assess whether a patient-specific molecular signature of radiation sensitivity could be used to identify the optimum radiotherapy dose.We used the gene-expression-based radiation-sensitivity index and the linear quadratic model to derive the genomic-adjusted radiation dose (GARD). A high GARD value predicts for high therapeutic effect for radiotherapy; which we postulate would relate to clinical outcome. Using data from the prospective, observational Total Cancer Care (TCC) protocol, we calculated GARD for primary tumours from 20 disease sites treated using standard radiotherapy doses for each disease type.

            "Purpose: The objectives of this randomized trial were to determine if interstitial thermoradiotherapy (ITRT) improves tumor regression\/control in accessible lesions in comparison with interstitial radiotherapy (IRT) alone and to assess the skin and soft tissue complications with either modality. Methods and Materials: From January 1986 to June 1992, 184 patients with persistent or recurrent tumors after previous radiotherapy and\/or surgery, which were amenable to interstitial radiotherapy, were accessioned to a protocol developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). One hundred seventy-three cases were analyzed (87 patients in the IRT group and 86 in the ITRT arm). The two arms were well balanced regarding stratification criteria. Most tumors were in the head and neck (40% in the IRT group and 46% in the ITRT group,) and pelvis (42% and 43%, respectively). Eighty-four percent of patients in both arms had prior radiation therapy (\u2265 40 Gy); 50% and 40%, respectively, had prior surgery, and 34% in each arm had prior chemotherapy. The dose of radiation therapy administered was dependent on the previous radiation dose and did not exceed a total cumulative dose of 100 Gy. Hyperthermia was delivered in one or two sessions, either before or before and after interstitial implant. The intended goal of the hyperthermia was to maintain a minimal tumor temperature of 42.5 C for 30 to 60 min. Results: There was no difference in any of the study end points between the two arms. Complete response (CR) was 53% and 55% in both arms. Two-year survival was 34% and 35%, respectively. Complete response rate for persistent lesions \u2026",
