            "There are thousands of different nanometer-scale pores in biology, many of which act as sensors for specific chemical agents. Recent work suggests that protein and solid-state nanopores have many potential uses in a wide variety of analytical applications. In this review we survey this field of research and discuss the prospects for advances that could be made in the near future.",

            "We review a variety of micro- and nanoparticle formulations produced with microfluidic methods. A diverse variety of approaches to generate microscale and nanoscale particles has been reported. Here we emphasize the use of microfluidics, specifically microfluidic systems that operate in a continuous flow mode, thereby allowing continuous generation of desired particle formulations. The generation of semiconductor quantum dots, metal colloids, emulsions, and liposomes is considered. To emphasize the potential benefits of the continuous-flow microfluidic methodology for nanoparticle generation, preliminary data on the size distribution of liposomes formed using the microfluidic approach is compared to the traditional bulk alcohol injection method.",
