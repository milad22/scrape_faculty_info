Here, we demonstrate that use of MWCNTs to generate heat in response to near-infrared radiation (NIR) results in thermal destruction of kidney cancer in vitro and in vivo. We document the thermal effects of the therapy through magnetic resonance temperature-mapping and heat shock protein-reactive immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that use of MWCNTs enables ablation of tumors with low laser powers (3 W\/cm2) and very short treatment times (a single 30-sec treatment) with minimal local toxicity and no evident systemic toxicity. These treatment parameters resulted in complete ablation of tumors and a >3.5-month durable remission in 80% of mice treated with 100 \u03bcg of MWCNT. Use of MWCNTs with NIR may be effective \u2026",

Protons offer potential for more liver sparing, but clinical situations in which protons may be superior to photons are not well described. We developed and validated a treatment decision model to determine whether liver tumors of certain sizes and locations are more suited for photon versus proton SBRT.Six spherical mock tumors from 1 to 6 cm in diameter were contoured on computed tomography images of 1 patient at 4 locations: dome, caudal, left medial, and central. Photon and proton plans were generated to deliver 50 Gy in 5 fractions to each tumor and optimized to deliver equivalent target coverage and maximal liver sparing. Using these plans, we developed a hypothesis-generating model to predict the optimal modality for maximal liver sparing based on tumor size \u2026",

Two groups of stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC patients (group 1: eight patients with tumor motion less than 5 mm; group 2: six patients with tumor motion equal to or more than 5 mm) were re-planned with SPArc and RO-IMPT. Both plans were generated using robust optimization to achieve an optimal coverage with 99% of internal target volume (ITV) receiving 66 Gy (RBE) in 33 fractions. The dosimetric results and plan robustness were compared for both groups. The interplay effect was evaluated based on the ITV coverage by single-fraction 4D dynamic dose. Total delivery time was simulated based on a full gantry rotation with energy-layer-switching-time (ELST) from 0.2 to 4 s. Statistical analysis was also evaluated via Wilcoxon signed rank test. Both SPArc and RO-IMPT plans achieved similar robust target volume coverage for all patients, while SPArc significantly reduced the doses to critical structures as well as the interplay effect. Specifically, compared to RO-IMPT, SPArc reduced the average integral dose by 7.4% (p\u2009=\u20090.001), V20, and mean lung dose by an average of 3.2% (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and 1.6 Gy (RBE) (p\u2009=\u20090.001), the max dose to cord by 4.6 Gy (RBE) (p\u2009=\u20090.04), and the mean dose to heart and esophagus by 0.7 Gy (RBE) (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and 1.7 Gy (RBE) (p\u2009=\u20090.003) respectively.
