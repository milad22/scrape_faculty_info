Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is believed to be an autoimmune disorder with disturbed glucose\/insulin metabolism, requiring life-long insulin replacement therapy (IRT), 30% of patients develop end-organ failure. We present our experience of cotransplantation of adipose tissue derived insulin-secreting mesenchymal stem cells (IS-AD-MSC) and cultured bone marrow (CBM) as IRT for these patients. Methods. This was a prospective open-labeled clinical trial to test efficacy and safety of IS-AD-MSC+CBM co-transplantation to treat IDDM, approved by the institutional review board after informed consent in 11 (males : females: 7 : 4) patients with 1\u201324-year disease duration, in age group: 13\u201343 years, on mean values of exogenous insulin requirement of 1.14 units\/kg\u2009BW\/day, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac): 8.47%, and c-peptide levels: 0.1\u2009ng\/mL. Intraportal infusion of xenogeneic-free IS-AD-MSC from living donors, subjected to defined culture conditions and phenotypically differentiated to insulin-secreting cells, with mean quantum: 1.5\u2009mL, expressing Pax-6, Isl-1, and pdx-1, cell counts:               2     .     1     \u00d7     1     0              3           \/\u03bcL, CD45\u2212\/90+\/73+:40\/30.1%, C-Peptide level:1.8\u2009ng\/mL, and insulin level: 339.3 \u2009IU\/mL with CBM mean quantum: 96.3\u2009mL and cell counts:               2     8     .     1     \u00d7     1     0              3           \/\u03bcL, CD45\u2212\/34+:0.62%, was carried out.

Replacement of damaged \u03b2 cells by cell therapy can treat it. Currently available strategies are insulin replacement and islet\/pancreas transplantation. Unfortunately these offer rescue for variable duration due to development of autoantibodies. For pancreas\/islet transplantation a deceased donor is required and various shortfalls of treatment include quantum, cumbersome technique, immune rejection and limited availability of donors. Stem cell therapy with assistance of cellular reprogramming and \u03b2-cell regeneration can open up new therapeutic modalities.
