            "The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter \u039b cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: \u03a9 b h 2= 0.02267+ 0.00058\u20130.00059, \u03a9 c h 2= 0.1131\u00b10.0034, \u03a9 \u039b= 0.726\u00b10.015, n s= 0.960\u00b10.013 \u2026",

            "WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat \u039b\u2010dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale\u2010invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best\u2010fit parameters are  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large\u2010scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly\u03b1 forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon\/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D\/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB \u2026",

Using WMAP data only, the best\u2010fit values for cosmological parameters for the power\u2010law flat \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) model are  . The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six\u2010dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power\u2010law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison\u2010Zel\u2019dovich\u2010Peebles scale\u2010invariant spectrum  .
