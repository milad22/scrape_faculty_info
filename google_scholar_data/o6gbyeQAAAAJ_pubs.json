            "Fullerene single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) were produced in yields of more than 70 percent by condensation of a laser-vaporized carbon-nickel-cobalt mixture at 1200\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy showed that these SWNTs are nearly uniform in diameter and that they self-organize into \u201cropes,\u201d which consist of 100 to 500 SWNTs in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 17 angstroms. The x-ray form factor is consistent with that of uniformly charged cylinders 13.8 \u00b1 0.2 angstroms in diameter. The ropes were metallic, with a single-rope resistivity of <10\u22124 ohm-centimeters at 300 kelvin. The uniformity of SWNT diameter is attributed to the efficient annealing of an initial fullerene tubelet kept open by a few metal atoms; the optimum diameter is determined by competition between the strain energy of curvature of the graphene sheet and the dangling-bond energy of the open edge \u2026",

            "Carbon nanotubes can be thought of as graphitic sheets with a hexagonal lattice that have been wrapped up into a seamless cylinder. Since their discovery in 1991 1, the peculiar electronic properties of these structures have attracted much attention. Their electronic conductivity, for example, has been predicted 2, 3, 4 to depend sensitively on tube diameter and wrapping angle (a measure of the helicity of the tube lattice), with only slight differences in these parameters causing a shift from a metallic to a semiconducting state. In other words, similarly shaped molecules consisting of only one element (carbon) may have very different electronic behaviour. Although the electronic properties of multi-walled and single-walled nanotubes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 have been probed experimentally, it has not yet been possible to relate these observations to the corresponding structure. Here we present the results of scanning \u2026",

For equivalent sheet resistance, the films exhibit optical transmittance comparable to that of commercial indium tin oxide in the visible spectrum, but far superior transmittance in the technologically relevant 2- to 5-micrometer infrared spectral band. These characteristics indicate broad applicability of the films for electrical coupling in photonic devices. In an example application, the films are used to construct an electric field\u2013activated optical modulator, which constitutes an optical analog to the nanotube-based field effect transistor.",

While good progress has been made in controlling the position of the macroscopic probe of such devices to sub-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m accuracy, and in designing sensitive detection schemes, less has been done to improve the probe tip itself 4. Ideally the tip should be as precisely defined as the object under investigation, and should maintain its integrity after repeated use not only in high vacuum but also in air and water. The best tips currently used for scanning probe microscopy do sometimes achieve sub-nanometre resolution, but they seldom survive a'tip crash'with the surface, and it is rarely clear \u2026",

The actuation mechanism (quantum chemical\u2013based expansion due to electrochemical double-layer charging) does not require ion intercalation, which limits the life and rate of faradaic conducting polymer actuators.

            "We describe, in detail, a readily scalable purification process capable of handling single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) material in large batches. Characterization of the resulting material by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman scattering, and TGA shows it to be highly pure. Resistivity measurements on freestanding mats of the purified tubes are also reported. We also report progress in scaling up SWNT production by the dual pulsed laser vaporization process. These successes enable the production of gram per day quantities of highly pure SWNT, which should greatly facilitate investigation of material properties intrinsic to the nanotubes.",

            "Electron transport in conductors is usually well described by Fermi-liquid theory, which assumes that the energy states of the electrons near the Fermi level E F are not qualitatively altered by Coulomb interactions. In one-dimensional systems, however, even weak Coulomb interactions cause strong perturbations. The resulting system, known as a Luttinger liquid, is predicted to be distinctly different from its two-and three-dimensional counterparts 1. For example, tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid at energies near the Fermi level is predicted to be strongly suppressed, unlike in two-and three-dimensional metals. Experiments on one-dimensional semiconductor wires 2, 2, 3 have been interpreted by using Luttinger-liquid theory, but an unequivocal verification of the theoretical predictions has not yet been obtained. Similarly, the edge excitations seen in fractional quantum Hall conductors are consistent with Luttinger \u2026",

            "Isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) were grown by disproportionation of carbon monoxide at 1200\u00b0C, catalyzed by molybdenum particles a few nanometers in size. The tube diameters, ranging from 1 to 5 nm, closely correlated with the size of the catalytic particle found attached to the tube end. This result represents the first experimental evidence of SWNT produced by pre-formed catalytic particles. A mechanism for nucleation that is quite distinct from our recently proposed mechanism of SWNT produced by laser vaporization is advanced for formation of SWNT in the present case.",
