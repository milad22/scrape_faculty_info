Elementary applications covered include the rotation groups and their spacetime generalization, the Lorentz group, as well as the eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices. In addition, more sophisticated applications include the exceptional Lie groups, octonionic projective spaces, and applications to particle physics including the remarkable fact that classical supersymmetry only exists in particular spacetime dimensions.

The result is that the total cognitive load is too high for many students at the transition from the calculus and introductory physics sequences to upper-division courses for physics majors. We illustrate typical student difficulties in the context of an Amp\u00e8re\u2019s law problem.",

            "We describe a new curriculum for the final two years of a B.S. program in Physics. Case studies in the junior year provide concrete examples or Paradigms as pillars to support systematic Capstone lectures in the senior year. In each of nine three-week Paradigms, the junior progresses from a descriptive lower-division understanding to an advanced analysis of a topic defined by phenomenon rather than discipline. Students generally view the new format with favor. They are better at visualization and make important connections among physics disciplines. Independent assessment is ongoing.",
