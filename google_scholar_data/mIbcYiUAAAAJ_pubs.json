            "Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators produce distinct tissue-specific biological effects, but within the confines of the established models of ER action it is difficult to understand why. Previous studies have suggested that there might be a relationship between ER structure and activity. Different ER modulators may induce conformational changes in the receptor that result in a specific biological activity. To investigate the possibility of modulator-specific conformational changes, we have applied affinity selection of peptides to identify binding surfaces that are exposed on the apo-ERs \u03b1 and \u03b2 and on each receptor complexed with estradiol or 4-OH tamoxifen. These peptides are sensitive probes of receptor conformation. We show here that ER ligands, known to produce distinct biological effects, induce distinct conformational changes in the receptors, providing a strong correlation between ER conformation and biological \u2026",

When these peptides were coexpressed with estrogen receptor \u03b1 in cells, they functioned as ligand-specific antagonists, indicating that estradiol-agonist and tamoxifen\u2013partial agonist activities do not occur by the same mechanism.

            "Recruitment of transcriptional coactivators following ligand activation is a critical step in nuclear receptor-mediated target gene expression. Upon binding an agonist, the receptor undergoes a conformational change which facilitates the formation of a specific coactivator binding pocket within the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. This permits the \u03b1-helical LXXLL motif within some coactivators to interact with the nuclear receptors. Until recently, the LXXLL motif was thought to function solely as a docking module; however, it now appears that sequences flanking the core motif may play a role in determining receptor selectivity. To address this issue, we used a combinatorial phage display approach to evaluate the role of flanking sequences in influencing these interactions. We sampled more than 108 variations of the core LXXLL motif with estradiol-activated estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) as a target and found three \u2026",

A robust peptide-based coating technology capable of easily modifying the surface of titanium (Ti) metal through noncovalent binding is described. A short peptide possessing affinity for Ti was identified using a phage display screening process and subjected to an amino acid substitution exercise using solid-phase chemical synthesis. Through these studies, the HKH tripeptide motif was elucidated as an important contributor to Ti binding within the Ti-binding peptide. This peptide spontaneously and selectively adsorbs onto a Ti surface from dilute aqueous solution with submicromolar binding affinities as determined by ELISA and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), through a process \u2026",

We have utilized peptides to detect inhibitors of protein function. We hypothesized that most peptide ligands identified by phage display would bind to regions of biological interaction in target proteins and that these peptides could be used as sensitive probes for detecting low molecular weight inhibitors that bind to these sites.Results: We selected a broad range of enzymes as targets for phage display and isolated a series of peptides that bound specifically to each target. Peptide ligands for each target contained similar amino acid sequences and competition analysis indicated that they bound one or two sites per target. Of 17 peptides tested, 13 were found to be specific inhibitors of enzyme function. Finally, we used two peptides \u2026",

            "Increasing bacterial drug resistance and hard-to-eradicate opportunistic infections have created a need for new antibiotics. Sequencing of microbial genomes has yielded many new potential targets for antibacterial drug discovery. However, little is known about the biochemical activities of many of these targets, making it difficult to develop HTS assays for them. Peptides isolated by phage display can be used as \u2018surrogate ligands\u2019 in competition assays for screening of targets of unknown function with small-molecule libraries. These screening assays can be adapted into a variety of high-throughput formats, including those based on radioactive, luminescence or fluorescence detection.",

            "DNA fragments cloned from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanobrevibacter smithii which complement mutations in the purE and proC genes of E. coli have been sequenced. Sequence analyses, transposon mutagenesis and expression in E. coli minicells indicate that purE and proC complementations result from the synthesis of M. smithii polypeptides with molecular weights of 36,697 and 27,836 respectively. The encoding genes appear to be located in operons. The M. smithii genome contains 69% A\/T basepairs (bp) which is reflected in unusual codon usages and intergenic regions containing approximately 85% A\/T bp. An insertion element, designated ISM1, was found within the cloned M. smithii DNA located adjacent to the proC complementing region. ISM1 is 1381 bp in length, has 29 bp terminal inverted repeat sequences and contains one major ORF encoded in 87% of the ISM1 \u2026",
