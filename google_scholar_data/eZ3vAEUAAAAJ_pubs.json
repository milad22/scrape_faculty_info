            "We address the nature of the Mott transition in the Hubbard model at half-filling using cluster dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We compare cluster-DMFT results with those of single-site DMFT. We show that inclusion of the short-range correlations on top of the on-site correlations does not change the order of the transition between the paramagnetic metal and the paramagnetic Mott insulator, which remains first order. However, the short range correlations reduce substantially the critical U and modify the shape of the transition lines. Moreover, they lead to very different physical properties of the metallic and insulating phases near the transition point. Approaching the transition from the metallic side, we find an anomalous metallic state with very low coherence scale. The insulating state is characterized by the narrow Mott gap with pronounced peaks at the gap edge.",

The calculation reproduces key features observed in the nickelate materials, including an insulating gap in the paramagnetic state, a strong variation of static magnetic moments among Ni sites and an absence of charge order. A connection between structure and insulating behavior is documented. The site-selective Mott transition may be a more broadly applicable concept in the description of correlated materials.",

In contrast to previous DFT and DFT+ U theories, the present method accounts for the experimentally observed structure of LaNiO 3 and the insulating nature of the other perovskites, and quantitatively reproduces the metal-insulator and structural phase diagram in the plane of pressure and rare earth element.
