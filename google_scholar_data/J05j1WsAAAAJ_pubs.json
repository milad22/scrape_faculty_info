For both structures, the oxygen stoichiometry decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. The transition temperature depends on the oxygen partial pressure and occurs when the stoichiometry is near Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.5. The tetragonal structure has a partially occupied, nearly octahedral Cu-O arrangement, in contrast to the orthorhombic structure which has one-dimensional Cu-O chains.

To analyze a wide range of superlattices, we derived a general kinematical diffraction formula that includes random, continuous, and discrete fluctuations from the average structure. We show that only the structure factor of one single layer of each material has to be averaged over the random variables and prove that this relation is equivalent to earlier, less general models. Implementing a nonlinear-fitting algorithm to fit the entire x-ray-diffraction profile, refined parameters that describe the average superlattice structure and deviations from this average are obtained. We compare the results of structural refinement to results obtained independently from other measurements. The roughness introduced artificially during growth in Mo\/Ni and Nb\/Cu superlattices is accurately reproduced by the refinement. The lattice \u2026",

            "We have discovered a positive unidirectional exchange anisotropy in antiferromagnetic (Fe F 2) and ferromagnetic (Fe) bilayers cooled through the antiferromagnetic critical temperature T N in large magnetic fields. For low positive cooling fields, the ferromagnet's magnetization (M\u2212 H) loop center shifts to negative fields, as is normally observed in other systems. In contrast, large cooling fields can cause the shift to be positive. This can be explained if the Fe F 2 surface spins couple to the external magnetic cooling field above T N and the Fe F 2-Fe interaction is antiferromagnetic.",

            "Considerable excitement has been generated by the report of superconductivity above 90 K in a multi-phase Y\u2013Ba\u2013Cu oxide 1. The superconducting phase was subsequently identified as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 2, 3. The complete replacement of Y by the trivalent rare-earths La\u2013Lu, with the exception of Ce, Pr and Tb, yields a superconducting phase with a critical temperature (T c) almost identical to that reported for the yttrium compound 4\u20137. This is somewhat surprising as most of these ions carry significant magnetic moments, the presence of which rapidly decreases T c in ordinary superconductors. The three exceptions noted, Ce, Pr and Tb, are the rare-earth ions which have a stable tetravalent state. Here we present the results of a study of the structure and transport properties of the series of compounds Y 1\u2212 x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 (x= 0\u2212 1.0), in which we observe a monotonic decrease in T c and eventually a \u2026",
