For x beyond a critical doping value of x c\u2248 0.05 the low-energy spin-fluctuation peak position shifts from (1 2, 1 2) to (1 2\u00b1\u03b4, 1 2), and (1 2, 1 2\u00b1\u03b4); x c also represents the onset concentration for superconductivity. For 0.06<~ x<~ 0.12 the incommensurability \u03b4 follows approximately the quantitative relation \u03b4= x. However, beyond x\u2248 0.12 the incommensurability tends to saturate around \u03b4\u2248 1\/8. The superconducting-transition temperature T c (x) for stoichiometric samples at a given doping scales linearly with \u03b4 up to the optimal doping value of x. The peak momentum width of the spin fluctuations at low energies is small throughout the superconducting concentration region except in the \u2026",

We first present accurate measurements of the magnetic correlation length and the sublattice magnetization of a carrier-free La 2 CuO 4 crystal and analyze these in the context of recent theoretical predictions. We then systematically investigate the influence of different dopants on the magnetism: Our measurements indicate that static vacancies in the La 2 Cu 1\u2212 y Zn y O 4 system affect the magnetic correlations in a similar manner as electrons in Pr 2\u2212 x Ce x CuO 4. The magnetic correlation length is much more rapidly suppressed as a function of x in La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4, and for x\u2264 0.04 we find that it obeys the empirical relation \u03be\u2212 1 (x, T)= \u03be\u2212 1 (x, 0)+ \u03be\u2212 1 (0, T), where \u03be (0, T) is the measured correlation length of the carrier-free sample.

Cation disorder at the Sr crystallographic site is inherent in these materials and strongly affects the value of T c. Partial substitution of Sr by Ln (Ln= La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, and Bi) in Bi 2 Sr 1.6 Ln 0.4 CuO 6+ \u03b4 results in a monotonic decrease of T c with increasing ionic radius mismatch. By minimizing Sr site disorder at the expense of Ca site disorder, we demonstrate that the T c of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 can be increased to 96 K.

The observed modulation is strongest at roughly half the superconducting gap energy and is aligned with the Cu-O bonds, with a periodicity of four lattice constants, exhibiting features characteristic of a two-dimensional system of line objects. These features also exhibit asymmetries between the two orthogonal directions locally, pointing to a possible broken symmetry state (ie, a stripe phase). We further show that the density of states modulation manifests itself as a shift of states from above to below the superconducting gap. The fact that a single energy scale (ie, the gap) appears for both superconductivity and stripes suggests that these two effects have the same microscopic origin.",

            "The pseudogap region of the phase diagram is an important unsolved puzzle in the field of high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductivity, characterized by anomalous physical properties 1, 2. There are open questions about the number of distinct phases and the possible presence of a quantum-critical point underneath the superconducting dome 3, 4, 5. The picture has remained unclear because there has not been conclusive evidence for a new type of order. Neutron scattering measurements for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ \u03b4 (YBCO) resulted in contradictory claims of no 6, 7 and weak 8, 9 magnetic order, and the interpretation of muon spin relaxation measurements on YBCO 10, 11 and of circularly polarized photoemission experiments on Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 (refs 12, 13) has been controversial. Here we use polarized neutron diffraction to demonstrate for the model superconductor HgBa 2 CuO 4+ \u03b4 (Hg1201 \u2026",

            "Neutron-scattering measurements have been performed to search for possible elastic incommensurate magnetic peaks in superconducting La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4 with x= 0.10, 0.12, and 0.15. The most dramatic effects are found for x= 0.12; in this case, the peak intensity first appears at the onset of superconductivity T c (= 31 K). The resolution-limited peak width indicates that the static magnetic correlation length exceeds 200 \u00c5 isotropically in the CuO 2 planes. Weak elastic peaks are also observed at low temperatures for x= 0.10 while for x= 0.15 any incommensurate elastic scattering is below the limit of detectability. Elastic peaks are observed in Zn-substituted nonsuperconducting La 1.88 Sr 0.12 Cu 0.97 Zn 0.03 0 4. However, in this case, the Zn substitution degrades the magnetic order; the peak appears at lower temperature (17 K) and the correlation length is shorter (80 \u00c5) than that in the Zn-free x= 0.12 sample.",

            "Electronic inhomogeneity appears to be an inherent characteristic of the enigmatic cuprate superconductors. Here we report the observation of charge\u2013density\u2013wave correlations in the model cuprate superconductor HgBa 2 CuO 4+ \u03b4 (T c= 72 K) via bulk Cu L 3-edge-resonant X-ray scattering. At the measured hole-doping level, both the short-range charge modulations and Fermi-liquid transport appear below the same temperature of about 200 K. Our result points to a unifying picture in which these two phenomena are preceded at the higher pseudogap temperature by q= 0 magnetic order and the build-up of significant dynamic antiferromagnetic correlations. The magnitude of the charge modulation wave vector is consistent with the size of the electron pocket implied by quantum oscillation and Hall effect measurements for HgBa 2 CuO 4+ \u03b4 and with corresponding results for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ \u03b4, which indicates \u2026",
