            "Pressures in the 100 MPa range are known to have an enormous number of effects on the action of proteins, but straightforward means for determining the structural basis of these effects have been lacking. Here, crystallography has been used to probe effects of pressure on sperm whale myoglobin structure. A comparison of pressure effects with those seen at low pH suggests that structural changes under pressure are interpretable as a shift in the populations of conformational substates. Furthermore, a novel high-pressure protein crystal-cooling method has been used to show low-temperature metastability, providing an alternative to room temperature, beryllium pressure cell-based techniques. The change in protein structure due to pressure is not purely compressive and involves conformational changes important to protein activity. Correlation with low-pH structures suggests observed structural changes are \u2026",

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies in cells have been reported previously. Many current FLIM systems use high repetition rate (~ 10 7 Hz) lasers optimized for nanosecond lifetime measurements, making measurement of long, microsecond lifetime fluorophores difficult. Here, we present an experimental approach for obtaining a large temporal dynamic range in a FLIM system by using a low repetition rate (10 1 Hz), high output, nitrogen pumped dye laser and a wide-field, intensified CCD camera for image detection. We explore the feasibility of the approach by imaging the oxygen-sensitive dye tris (2, 2'-bipyridyl) dichloro-ruthenium (II) hexahydrate (RTDP) in solution and in living cells.

We found that the emission spectrum of the protonated form does not exhibit sensitivity to pressure, whereas the deprotonated form shows a piezochromic shift consistent with increased ICT character.

Here, we use nanosecond-gated spectral acquisition, combined with spectrum-shape quantification, to monitor the long excited-state lifetime autofluorescence (usually associated with protein-bound NADH conformations) separately from the autofluorescence signal as a whole. We observe that the autofluorescence response induced by two NADH-oxidation inhibitors\ue5f8cyanide and ethanol\ue5f8are similar in Saccharomyces cerevisiae when monitored using time-integrated detection but easily distinguished using time-gated detection.

            "Summary form only given. Fluorescence lifetimes are sensitive to local physical conditions and insensitive to artifacts affecting intensity based measurements, providing a complementary source of contrast for fluorescence microscopy. While lifetime microscopy is well-developed at visible wavelengths (e.g. fluorescence resonance energy transfer between exogenous fluorophores), FLIM of endogenous fluorophores is less developed with many potential uses (e.g. biomedical diagnostics). Near UV wavelengths may become important in clinical applications because structural proteins and metabolic co-factors have excitation maxima in this wavelength region. This paper presents the construction of a FLIM system with the sensitivity to detect cellular autofluorescence.",
