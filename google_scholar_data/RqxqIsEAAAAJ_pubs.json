            "Neutron stars with very strong surface magnetic fields have been suggested as the site for the origin of observed soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). In this paper we investigate the influence of such strong magnetic fields on the properties and internal structure of these strongly magnetized neutron stars (magnetars). We study properties of a degenerate equilibrium ideal neutron\u2010proton\u2010electron (npe) gas with and without the effects of the anomalous nucleon magnetic moment in a strong magnetic field. The presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field changes the ratio of protons to neutrons as well as the neutron drip density. We also study the appearance of muons as well as pion condensation in strong magnetic fields. We discuss the possibility that boson condensation in the interior of magnetars might be a source of SGRs.",

In this paper we explore the possibility that such stars could have sufficiently strong internal fields to alter their structure. We obtain a revised white dwarf mass\u2010radius relation in the presence of strong internal magnetic fields. We first derive the equation of state for a fully degenerate ideal electron gas in a magnetic field using an Euler\u2010MacLaurin expansion.

A puzzling feature of these data, however, is that some stars appear to have radii which are significantly smaller than that expected for a standard electron-degenerate white-dwarf equations of state. We construct a projection of white-dwarf radii for fixed effective mass and conclude that there is at least marginal evidence for bimodality in the radius distribution for white dwarfs. We argue that if such compact white dwarfs exist it is unlikely that they contain an iron core. We propose an alternative of strange-quark matter within the white-dwarf core. We also discuss the impact of the so-called color-flavour-locked (CFL) state in strange-matter core associated with color superconductivity. We show that the data \u2026",

These corrections are based upon our recently computed renormalized electron mass and modified state density due to the background thermal bath in the early universe.

We also find that the primordial 4 He abundance decreases by \u0394 Y p\u2243 0.01 while D and 7 Li increase.

We conclude that such instabilities will likely occur in the deep outer crust for the magnetic Baym, Pethick, and Sutherland model and in the inner crust and core for magnetars described in the relativistic Hartree theory.
