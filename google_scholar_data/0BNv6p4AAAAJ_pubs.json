            "The characteristics of well-aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW)\/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy- thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT) heterojunction solar cells with varying nanowire lengths are investigated. PEDOT adheres on the hydrophilic n-type silicon nanowire surface to form a core\u2212sheath heterojunction structure through the solution process. Such a structure increases the area of heterojunctions and shortens the carrier diffusion distance, and therefore, it greatly increases carrier collection efficiency. The cells exhibit stable rectifying diode behavior. Compared to the cells without a nanowire structure, the series resistance of the SiNW\/PEDOT cell decreases from 60.42 \u03a9 cm2 to 1.47 \u03a9 cm2, and the power conversion efficiency improves from 0.08% to 5.09%. The SiNW\/PEDOT solar cell harvests photons from 400 nm to 1100 nm and a maximum incident phototo-current conversion efficiency of \u223c32% at 700 nm.",

A pre-surface treatment was applied on a silicon wafer before the process of metal-assisted etching in silver nitrate and hydrogen fluoride solution. The treatment made silver ion continuously reduce on silver nuclei adherence on the silicon surface, leading to formation of dense silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles acting as local redox centers cause the formation of dense silicon nanowire arrays. In contrast, an H-terminated silicon surface made silver ion reduce uniformly on the silicon surface to form silver flakes. The silicon nanowires fabricated with a pre-surface treatment reveals higher density than those fabricated without a pre-surface treatment. The volume fraction improves from 18 to 38%. This improvement reduces the solar-weighted reflectance to as low as 3.3% for silicon \u2026",

The PEDOT: PSS adheres to the surface of the GaAs NW arrays to form ap\u2013n junction. The morphology of GaAs NW arrays strongly influences the characteristics of the GaAs NW\/PEDOT: PSS hybrid solar cells. The suppression of reflectance and the interpenetrating heterojunction interface of GaAs NW arrays offers great improvements in efficiency relative to a conventional planar cell.

ZnO NRs are successfully grown on an organic layer of PF using a modified seeding layer. The EL spectrum shows a broad emission band covering the entire visible range from 400 to 800 nm. White-light emission is possible because the ZnO-defect-related emission from the ZnO NR\/PF heterostructure is enhanced to become over thousand times stronger than that from the usual ZnO NR structure. This strong green\u2013yellow emission associated with the ZnO defects, combined with the blue PF-related emission, results in the white-light emission. Enhancement of the ZnO-defect emission is caused by the presence of Zn (OH) 2 at the interface between the ZnO NRs and PF. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \u2026",
