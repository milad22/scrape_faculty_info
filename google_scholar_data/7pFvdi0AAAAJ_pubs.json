In situ structural and chemical analyses reveal stoichiometric layered film growth with atomically smooth surface morphologies. Film growth along the (001) direction is confirmed by X-ray diffraction, and the crystalline nature of growth in the 2H phase is evident from Raman spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy is used to confirm the layered film structure and hexagonal arrangement of surface atoms. Temperature-dependent electrical measurements show an insulating behavior that agrees well with a two-dimensional variable-range hopping model, suggesting that transport in these films is dominated by localized charge-carrier states.",

The goal of this work is to demonstrate a high-\u03ba dielectric that serves as an effective n-type charge transfer dopant on monolayer (ML) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Utilizing amorphous titanium suboxide (ATO) as the \u201chigh-\u03ba dopant\u201d, we achieved a contact resistance of \u223c180 \u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm that is the lowest reported value for ML MoS2. An ON current as high as 240 \u03bcA\/\u03bcm and field effect mobility as high as 83 cm2\/V-s were realized using this doping technique. Moreover, intrinsic mobility as high as 102 cm2\/V-s at 300 K and 501 cm2\/V-s at 77 K were achieved after ATO encapsulation \u2026",

A sharp increase in the magnetoresistance with magnetic field at low temperature indicates the existence of weak anti-localization. The measured weak anti-localization effect agrees well with the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model, and the extracted phase coherence length shows a power-law dependence with temperature indicating the existence of a two-dimensional system. An insulating ground state has also been observed at low temperature showing a logarithmic divergence of the resistance that appears to be the influence of electron-electron interaction in a two-dimensional system.",

The perpendicular field magnetoresistance has been explained by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka theory alone in a system with strong spin-orbit coupling, from which we have estimated the mean free path, the phase coherence length, and the spin-orbit relaxation time. We have obtained the out-of-plane spin-orbit relaxation time to be small and the in-plane spin-orbit relaxation time to be comparable to the momentum relaxation time. The estimation of these charge and spin transport parameters are useful for spintronics applications. For parallel field magnetoresistance, we have confirmed the presence of Zeeman effect which is otherwise suppressed in perpendicular field magnetoresistance due to strong spin-orbit coupling.

Direct experimental measurements for the lower critical dimension for spin glasses is provided as an example. The method makes use of the spin glass correlation length \u03be (t, T).

Conventional behavior is observed as long as \u03be (t, T)< L. At the measurement time t co, when \u03be (t co, T)\u2248 L, the time dependence is observed to cross over to exponential.
