            "Synthetic photonic materials are an emerging platform for exploring the interface between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic material properties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Photons experiencing a Lorentz force develop handedness, providing opportunities to study quantum Hall physics and topological quantum science 6, 7, 8. Here we present an experimental realization of a magnetic field for continuum photons. We trap optical photons in a multimode ring resonator to make a two-dimensional gas of massive bosons, and then employ a non-planar geometry to induce an image rotation on each round-trip 9. This results in photonic Coriolis\/Lorentz and centrifugal forces and so realizes the Fock\u2013Darwin Hamiltonian for photons in a magnetic field and harmonic trap 10. Using spatial-and energy-resolved spectroscopy, we track the resulting photonic eigenstates as radial trapping is reduced, finally observing a \u2026",

It amounts to a coupling of the nonrelativistic system to the Newton-Cartan (NC) geometry with torsion. The approach generalizes the classic Luttinger\u2019s formulation of thermal transport. In particular, we clarify the geometric meaning of the fields conjugated to energy and energy current. These fields describe the geometric background with nonvanishing temporal torsion. We use the developed formalism to construct the equilibrium partition function of a nonrelativistic system coupled to the NC geometry in 2+ 1 dimensions and to derive various thermodynamic relations.",

In the lowest order in gradients, the linear response generating functional includes Chern-Simons, Wen-Zee, and gravitational Chern-Simons terms. The latter term has a contribution from the framing anomaly which fixes the value of thermal Hall conductivity and contributes to the Hall viscosity of the FQH states on a sphere.

We propose a resolution to this problem by introducing a theory invariant under area-preserving diffeomorphisms, which reduce to the higher rank gauge transformations upon linearization around a flat background. The proposed theory is geometric in nature and is interpreted as a theory of chiral topological elasticity. This theory exhibits some of the fracton phenomenology. We explore the conservation laws, topological excitations, linear response, various kinematical constraints, and canonical structure of the theory.

They describe Hall conductance and, with some provisions, thermal Hall conductance. The remaining two, including the Wen-Zee term, which contributes to the Hall viscosity, do not protect gapless edge modes but are instead related to the local boundary response fixed by symmetries.

It is an extension of space (time) symmetries of a charge-conserving matter that includes global symmetries responsible for the conservation of various components of the multipole moments of the charge density. We explain how to construct field theories invariant under the action of the algebra. These field theories generally break rotational invariance and exhibit anisotropic scaling. We further explain how to partially gauge the multipole algebra. Such gauging makes the symmetries responsible for the conservation of multipole moments local, while keeping rotation and translations symmetries global.
