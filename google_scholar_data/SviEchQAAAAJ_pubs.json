            "We review our present understanding of those non-perturbative features of supersymmetric gauge theories that are believed to determine the properties of their ground states (vacua). A wide variety of theories is discussed in detail: pure Yang-Mills, theories with massive or massless real matter fields, theories with chiral matter, both for SU(N) and for the case of a general compact gauge group (as for instance E8). Depending on some general features of the theory under consideration, various (perhaps) unexpected phenomena are shown to occur. Among these the breakdown of the (perturbatively established) non-renormalization theorem, the occurrence of runaway vacua in certain limits, the spontaneous dynamical breaking of supersymmetry itself in some chiral theories. Throughout the report we restrict ourselves to the confining picture instanton method, occasionally complementing it with the information \u2026",

            "The semileptonic decay channel B-> D tau nu is sensitive to the presence of a scalar current, such as that mediated by a charged-Higgs boson. Recently the BaBar experiment reported the first observation of the exclusive semileptonic decay B-> D tau nu, finding an approximately 2-sigma disagreement with the Standard-Model prediction for the ratio R (D)= BR (B-> D tau nu)\/BR (B-> D l nu), where l= e, mu. We compute this ratio of branching fractions using hadronic form factors computed in unquenched lattice QCD and obtain R (D)= 0.316 (12)(7), where the errors are statistical and total systematic, respectively. This result is the first Standard-Model calculation of R (D) from ab initio full QCD. Its error is smaller than that of previous estimates, primarily due to the reduced uncertainty in the scalar form factor f_0 (q^ 2). Our determination of R (D) is approximately 1-sigma higher than previous estimates and, thus, reduces the tension with experiment. We also compute R (D) in models with electrically charged scalar exchange, such as the type II two-Higgs doublet model. Once again, our result is consistent with, but approximately 1-sigma higher than, previous estimates for phenomenologically relevant values of the scalar coupling in the type II model. As a byproduct of our calculation, we also present the Standard-Model prediction for the longitudinal polarization ratio P_L (D)= 0.325 (4)(3).",

We use the MILC asqtad (2+1)-flavor lattice configurations at four lattice spacings and light-quark masses down to 1\/20 of the physical strange-quark mass. We extrapolate the lattice form factors to the continuum using staggered chiral perturbation theory in the hard-pion and SU(2) limits. We employ a model-independent z parametrization to extrapolate our lattice form factors from large-recoil momentum to the full kinematic range. We introduce a new functional method to propagate information from the chiral-continuum extrapolation to the z expansion. We present our results together with a complete systematic error budget, including a covariance matrix to enable the combination of our form factors with other lattice-QCD and experimental results. To obtain |Vub|, we simultaneously fit the experimental data for the B\u2192\u03c0\u2113\u03bd differential decay rate obtained by the BABAR and Belle collaborations together with our lattice form-factor results.

            "We show that, for two nontrivial \u03bb \u03c6 4 problems (the anharmonic oscillator and the Landau-Ginzburg hierarchical model), improved perturbative series can be obtained by cutting off the large field contributions. The modified series converge to values exponentially close to the exact ones. For \u03bb larger than some critical value, the method outperforms Pad\u00e9\u2019s approximants and Borel summations. The method can also be used for series which are not Borel summable such as the double-well potential series. We show that semiclassical methods can be used to calculate the modified Feynman rules, estimate the error, and optimize the field cutoff.",
