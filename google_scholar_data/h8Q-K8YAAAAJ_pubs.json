Combined with a jet invariant mass cut, N-subjettiness is an effective discriminating variable for tagging boosted objects and rejecting the background of QCD jets with large invariant mass. In efficiency studies of boosted W bosons and top quarks, we find tagging efficiencies of 30% are achievable with fake rates of 1%. We also consider the discovery potential for new heavy resonances that decay to pairs of boosted objects, and find significant improvements are possible using N-subjettiness. In this way, N-subjettiness combines the advantages of jet shapes with the discriminating power seen in previous jet substructure algorithms.",

Given N subjet axes within a jet, N-subjettiness sums the angular distances of jet constituents to their nearest subjet axis. Here, we generalize and improve on N-subjettiness by minimizing over all possible subjet directions, using a new variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. On boosted top benchmark samples from the BOOST2010 workshop, we demonstrate that a simple cut on the 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness ratio yields 20%(50%) tagging efficiency for a 0.23%(4.1%) fake rate, making N-subjettiness a highly effective boosted top tagger. N-subjettiness can be modified by adjusting an angular weighting exponent, and we find that the jet broadening measure is preferred for boosted top searches. We also explore multivariate techniques, and show that additional improvements are possible using a modified Fisher \u2026",

Such couplings can arise for the dilaton as well as for moduli and axion-like particles in the presence of C P violation. Ultralight dilaton DM acts as a background field that can cause tiny but coherent oscillations in Standard Model parameters such as the fine-structure constant and the proton-electron mass ratio. These minute variations can be detected through precise frequency comparisons of atomic clocks. Our experiment extends current searches for drifts in fundamental constants to the well-motivated high-frequency regime. Our proposed setups can probe scalars lighter than 1 0\u2212 15 eV with a discovery potential of dilatonic couplings as weak as 1 0\u2212 11 times the strength of gravity, improving current equivalence principle bounds by up to 8 orders of magnitude.

Bounds on the gluino are of particular importance, since it radiatively \u201csucks\u201d up the stop and Higgs-up soft masses. As a result, even models that easily accommodate a 125 GeV Higgs are almost as tuned as the simplest version of SUSY, the MSSM: at best at the percent level. In this paper, we further examine how current LHC results constrain naturalness in three classes of models that may relax LHC bounds on sparticles: split families, baryonic RPV, and Dirac gauginos. In models of split families and bRPV, the bounds on the gluino are only slightly reduced, resulting in a few percent tuning. In particular, having a natural spectrum in bRPV models typically implies that tops, W s, and Zs are easily produced in the cascade decays of squarks and gluinos.

This structure formation enhancement is driven by parametric resonance when the initial field misalignment is large, and it affects axion density perturbations on length scales of order the Hubble horizon when the axion field starts oscillating, deep inside the radiation-dominated era. This effect can turn an otherwise nearly scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations into one that has a spike at the aforementioned scales, producing objects ranging from dense DM halos to scalar-field configurations such as solitons and oscillons.
