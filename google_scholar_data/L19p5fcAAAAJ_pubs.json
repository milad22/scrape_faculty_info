Our main result is to rewrite a generic theory of gravity near a two-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime throat as a novel hydrodynamics coupled to the correlation functions of a conformal quantum mechanics. This gives a prescription for the computation of n-point functions in the dual quantum mechanics. We thereby find that the dual is maximally chaotic.",

We extend a previously proposed Schwarzian effective action to include a phase field, and this describes the low-temperature energy and Q fluctuations. We obtain higher-dimensional generalizations of the SYK models which display disordered metallic states without quasiparticle excitations, and we deduce their thermoelectric transport coefficients. We also examine the corresponding properties of Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories on black brane geometries which interpolate from either AdS 4 or AdS 5 to an AdS 2\u00d7 R 2 or AdS 2\u00d7 R 3 near-horizon geometry.

We show that Newton-Cartan geometry subject to the shift symmetry arises in null reductions of Lorentzian manifolds, and so our proposal is realized for theories which are holographically dual to quantum gravity on Schr\u00f6dinger spacetimes. We use this null reduction to efficiently form tensorial invariants under the boost and particle number symmetries.
