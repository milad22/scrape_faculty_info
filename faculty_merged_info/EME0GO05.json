The microwave techniques of Electron Paramagnetic\n                           Resonance (EPR), Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR), and Microwave Modulated\n                           Photoluminescence (MMPL) are usually employed in these studies. Amorphous silicon,\n                           crystalline III-V semiconductors, and chalcogenides have been the subjects of recent\n                           investigations.
