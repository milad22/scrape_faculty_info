                "Robert P. Devaty Associate Professor 211 Allen Hall (412) 624-9009 devaty@pitt.edu Dr. Devaty's research focuses on large bandgap semiconductors, especially silicon carbide (SiC). His interests include infrared reflectance, low temperature photoluminescence, magneto\u2013optical spectroscopy, SiC Schottky barriers, carrier lifetime measurements, and shallow impurities and deep centers in SiC. For a time, porous SiC was a topic of special interest. Currently (August 2017), the Large Bandgap Semiconductor Group is measuring and interpreting detailed near band edge absorption spectra of 4H and 6H SiC measured using wavelength modulated spectroscopy. These experiments provide detailed information about the electronic energy bands near the valence and conduction band minima, the phonons, and the electronic structure and behavior of free excitons. Among other topics, we are investigating the optical emission associated with breakdown in reverse biased SiC p-i-n structures.
