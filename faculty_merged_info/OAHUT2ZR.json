                "We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy\u2019s supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995\u20132007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000\u20132007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short\u2010period star S0\u20102 provides values for the distance ( ) of   kpc, the enclosed mass ( ) of    , and the black hole\u2019s RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s\u22121 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining   kpc and    . More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3\u2013    within 0.01 pc, \u223c100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the \u2026",
                "We report the results of the first\u2010epoch observation with the ACIS\u2010I instrument on the Chandra X\u2010Ray Observatory of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact radio source associated with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the dynamical center of the Milky Way. This observation produced the first X\u2010ray (0.5\u20137 keV) spectroscopic image with arcsecond resolution of the central   ( ) of the Galaxy. We report the discovery of an X\u2010ray source, CXOGC J174540.0\u2212290027, coincident with Sgr A* within  . The probability of a false match is estimated to be \u22720.5%. The spectrum is well fitted either by an absorbed power law with photon index   or by an absorbed optically thin thermal plasma with   keV and column density   cm\u22122. The observed flux in the 2\u201310 keV band is \u2248  ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121, and the absorption\u2010corrected luminosity is \u2248  ergs s\u22121. The X\u2010ray emission at the position of Sgr A* is extended, with an intrinsic size of \u2026",
                "We present new diffraction\u2010limited images of the Galactic center, obtained with the W. M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within 0 4 of the Galaxy\u2019s central dark mass, 17 proper\u2010motion stars, with K magnitudes ranging from 14.0 to 16.8, are identified, and 10 of these are new detections (six were also independently discovered by others). In this sample, three newly identified (S0\u201016, S0\u201019, and S0\u201020) and four previously known (S0\u20101, S0\u20102, S0\u20104, and S0\u20105) sources have measured proper motions that reveal orbital solutions. Orbits are derived simultaneously so that they jointly constrain the central dark object\u2019s properties: its mass, its position, and, for the first time using orbits, its motion on the plane of the sky. This analysis pinpoints the Galaxy\u2019s central dark mass to within 1.3 mas (10 AU) and limits its proper motion to   mas yr\u22121 (or equivalently   km s\u22121) with respect to the central stellar cluster.

                "The central half kiloparsec region of our Galaxy harbors a variety of phenomena unique to the central environment. This review discusses the observed structure and activity of the interstellar medium in this region in terms of its inevitable inflow toward the center of the Galactic gravitational potential well. A number of dissipative processes lead to a strong concentration of gas into a \u201cCentral Molecular Zone\u201d of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular medium is characterized by large densities, large velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and apparently strong magnetic fields. The physical state of the gas and the resultant star formation processes occurring in this environment are therefore quite unlike those occurring in the large-scale disk. Gas not consumed by star formation either enters a hot X ray\u2013emitting halo and is lost as a thermally driven galactic wind or continues moving inward, probably \u2026",
                "Over a 2 year period we have conducted a diffraction-limited imaging study at 2.2 \u03bcm of the inner 6''\u00d7 6''of the central stellar cluster of the Galaxy using the WM Keck 10 m telescope. The K-band images obtained in 1995 June, 1996 June, and 1997 May have the highest angular resolution obtained at near-infrared wavelengths from ground or space (\u03b8 res= 0 farcs 05= 0.002 pc) and reveal a large population of faint stars. We use an unbiased approach for identifying and selecting stars to be included in this proper-motion study, which results in a sample of 90 stars with brightness ranging from K= 9-17 mag and two-dimensional velocities as large as 1400\u00b1100 km s-1. Compared to earlier work (Eckart et al. 1997; Genzel et al. 1997), the source confusion is reduced by a factor of 9, the number of stars with proper-motion measurement in the central 25 arcsec 2 of our Galaxy is doubled, and the accuracy of the velocity \u2026",
                "The nuclei of most galaxies are now believed to harbour supermassive black holes 1. The motions of stars in the central few light years of our Milky Way Galaxy indicate the presence of a dark object with a mass of about 2.6\u00d7 10 6 solar masses (refs 2, 3). This object is spatially coincident with the compact radio source Sagittarius A*(Sgr A*) at the dynamical centre of the Galaxy, and the radio emission is thought to be powered by the gravitational potential energy released by matter as it accretes onto a supermassive black hole 4, 5. Sgr A* is, however, much fainter than expected at all wavelengths, especially in X-rays, which has cast some doubt on this model. The first strong evidence for X-ray emission was found only recently 6. Here we report the discovery of rapid X-ray flaring from the direction of Sgr A*, which, together with the previously reported steady X-ray emission, provides compelling evidence that the \u2026"
