                "Blueshifted absorption lines in the UV and X-ray spectra of active galaxies reveal the presence of massive outflows of ionized gas from their nuclei. The \u201cintrinsic\u201d UV and X-ray absorbers show large global covering factors of the central continuum source, and the inferred mass loss rates are comparable to the mass accretion rates. Many absorbers show variable ionic column densities, which are attributed to a combination of variable ionizing flux and motion of gas into and out of the line of sight. Detailed studies of the intrinsic absorbers, with the assistance of monitoring observations and photoionization models, provide constraints on their kinematics, physical conditions, and locations relative to the central continuum source, which range from the inner nucleus (\u223c0.01 pc) to the galactic disk or halo (\u223c10 kpc). Dynamical models that make use of thermal winds, radiation pressure, and\/or hydromagnetic \u2026",
                "We present a study of the intrinsic absorption lines in the ultraviolet spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The study is based on spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and includes the Seyfert 1 galaxies observed with the Faint Object Spectrograph and Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph at spectral resolutions of \u03bb\/\u0394\u03bb\u2248 1000-20,000 with good signal-to-noise ratios. We find that the fraction of Seyfert 1 galaxies that show intrinsic absorption associated with their active nuclei is more than one-half (10 of 17), which is much higher than previous estimates (3%-10%) based on IUE data. There is a one-to-one correspondence between Seyfert galaxies that show intrinsic UV absorption and X-ray\" warm absorbers,\" indicating that these two phenomena are related. Although our sample is not complete, we conclude that intrinsic absorption represents an important component that needs to be integrated into our overall \u2026",
                "The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the second servicing mission, in 1997 February. Four bands cover the wavelength range of 115\u20131000 nm, with spectral resolving powers between 26 and 200,000. Camera modes are used for target acquisition and deep imaging. Correction for HST's spherical aberration and astigmatism is included. The 115\u2013170 nm range is covered by a CsI MAMA (Multianode Microchannel Array) detector and the 165\u2013310 nm range by a Cs 2 Te MAMA, each with a format of 2048\u00d7 2048 pixels, while the 305\u2013555 and 550\u20131000 nm ranges are covered by a single CCD with a format of 1024\u00d7 1024 pixels. The multiplexing advantage of using these two\u2010dimensional detectors compared with the 1\u00d7 512 pixel detectors of the first\u2010generation spectrographs is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, depending on the mode \u2026"

                "Steve Kraemer Steve Kraemer Assocate Dean for Graduate Programs and Research\/ Professor and Director of IACS Dr. Kraemer is an extra-galactic astrophysicist and has extensive experience in the modeling of photoionized nebulae and the analysis of X-ray, UV, optical and IR spectra of active galaxies, in particular Seyfert galaxies. He has been PI of observing programs using Chandra, XMM-Newton, Hubble Space Telescope, and Spitzer. Dr. Kraemer was a co-investigator on the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph Instrument Development Team. Specific areas of research, which Kraemer conducts with Professor Mike Crenshaw (Georgia State University), Professor Jane Turner (UMBC), Dr. Henrique Schmitt (Naval Research Lab), Dr. Marcio Melendez (UMCP), Dr. T. Cody Fischer (GSU), among others, include: Mass Outflows in AGN and AGN feedback. The relationship between the mass of the central bulge of galaxies and that of the super-massive black holes that reside within suggests co-evolution. One possible mechanism is the clearing of gas by winds generated by the AGN, i.e. \"AGN feedback\". Mass outflows, in the form of blueshifted absorption lines in the UV and X-ray, are found in approximately half of all Seyfert galaxies, with radial velocities up to several 1000 km\/s. These outflows may be powerful enough to affect the host galaxy and hence may provide insight into AGN feedback processes. Physical conditions in the gas in the narrow-line regions (NLR) of Seyfert galaxies. Of particular interest is the question: is this gas ionized solely by EUV-Xray radiation from the central nuclear source or are there other important effects, such as ionization by relativistic particles associated with radio ``jets''? Furthermore, we have found that star-formation makes a significant contribution to the mid-IR emission-line spectra of many Seyfert galaxies and, likely, to optical spectra of the NLR. The kinematics of the narrow-line gas in Seyfert galaxies. Understanding the motion of gas in the inner regions of Seyfert galaxies may provide important clues regarding the evolution of this phase of activity. By combining the kinematic studies with the physical parameters of the NLR derived from photo-ionization modeling, we have found that NLR outflows may be more important to AGN feedback than outflows originating close to the AGN.
