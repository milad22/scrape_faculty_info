                "Blueshifted absorption lines in the UV and X-ray spectra of active galaxies reveal the presence of massive outflows of ionized gas from their nuclei. The \u201cintrinsic\u201d UV and X-ray absorbers show large global covering factors of the central continuum source, and the inferred mass loss rates are comparable to the mass accretion rates. Many absorbers show variable ionic column densities, which are attributed to a combination of variable ionizing flux and motion of gas into and out of the line of sight. Detailed studies of the intrinsic absorbers, with the assistance of monitoring observations and photoionization models, provide constraints on their kinematics, physical conditions, and locations relative to the central continuum source, which range from the inner nucleus (\u223c0.01 pc) to the galactic disk or halo (\u223c10 kpc). Dynamical models that make use of thermal winds, radiation pressure, and\/or hydromagnetic \u2026",
                "We present a study of the intrinsic absorption lines in the ultraviolet spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The study is based on spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and includes the Seyfert 1 galaxies observed with the Faint Object Spectrograph and Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph at spectral resolutions of \u03bb\/\u0394\u03bb\u2248 1000-20,000 with good signal-to-noise ratios. We find that the fraction of Seyfert 1 galaxies that show intrinsic absorption associated with their active nuclei is more than one-half (10 of 17), which is much higher than previous estimates (3%-10%) based on IUE data. There is a one-to-one correspondence between Seyfert galaxies that show intrinsic UV absorption and X-ray\" warm absorbers,\" indicating that these two phenomena are related. Although our sample is not complete, we conclude that intrinsic absorption represents an important component that needs to be integrated into our overall \u2026",
                "The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the second servicing mission, in 1997 February. Four bands cover the wavelength range of 115\u20131000 nm, with spectral resolving powers between 26 and 200,000. Camera modes are used for target acquisition and deep imaging. Correction for HST's spherical aberration and astigmatism is included. The 115\u2013170 nm range is covered by a CsI MAMA (Multianode Microchannel Array) detector and the 165\u2013310 nm range by a Cs 2 Te MAMA, each with a format of 2048\u00d7 2048 pixels, while the 305\u2013555 and 550\u20131000 nm ranges are covered by a single CCD with a format of 1024\u00d7 1024 pixels. The multiplexing advantage of using these two\u2010dimensional detectors compared with the 1\u00d7 512 pixel detectors of the first\u2010generation spectrographs is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, depending on the mode \u2026"
