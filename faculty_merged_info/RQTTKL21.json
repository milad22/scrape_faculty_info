Analysis of dynamical quantities (such as fractal dimensions and Lyapunov exponents 3) has provided insights into low-dimensional systems; but it has proven more difficult to understand spatiotemporal chaos in high-dimensional systems, despite abundant data describing its statistical properties 1, 4, 5. Initial attempts have been made to extend the dynamical approach to higher-dimensional systems, demonstrating numerically that the spatiotemporal chaos in several simple models is extensive 6, 7, 8 (the number of dynamical degrees of freedom scales with the system volume). Here we report a computational investigation of a phenomenon found in nature,\u2018spiral defect\u2019chaos 5, 9 in Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, in which we find that the spatiotemporal chaos in this state is extensive and \u2026",
                "We study the range of orientational order of a single layer of cylindrical block copolymer microdomains annealed on several types of substrates. The orientational persistence length or nematic correlation length (\u03be) is evaluated using recently developed imaging and analysis methods to measure the grain size of the block copolymer microdomains. We show that the substrate can lower \u03be for block copolymers with a majority component that interacts strongly with the substrate, but this can be mitigated by attaching a buffer layer of polystyrene brushes to the substrate. In addition, we show that, for a block copolymer where the block that strongly interacts with the substrate is the minority component, the microdomain correlation length does not increase when substrates are treated with this buffer layer. We suggest that in this case the brushes do not increase \u03be not only because of the lower volume fraction of the strongly \u2026",
                "The role of forcing on the dynamics of a vertically shaken granular monolayer is investigated. Using a flat plate, surprising negative velocity correlations are measured. A mechanism for this anticorrelation is proposed with support from both experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations. Using a rough plate, velocity correlations are positive, and the velocity distribution evolves from a Gaussian at very low densities to a broader distribution at high densities. These results are interpreted as a balance between stochastic forcing, interparticle collisions, and friction with the plate.",
                "The locally dense basis set approach to the calculation of nuclear magnetic resonance shieldings is one in which a sufficiently large or dense set of basis functions is used for an atom or molecular fragment containing the resonant nucleus or nuclei of interest and fewer or attenuated sets of basis functions employed elsewhere. Provided the dense set is of sufficient size, this approach is capable of determining chemical shieldings nearly as well as a calculation with a balanced basis set of quality equal to the locally dense set, but with considerable savings of CPU time. Detailed comparisons are provided of locally dense and balanced calculations in the gauge including atomic orbital (GIAO) method for the individual principal values, the isotropic shieldings, and the tensor orientations for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and phosphorus nuclei. It is seen that chemical functional groups can often define \u2026",
                "We analyze experimental data from Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection in a large aspect ratio cell using a new, efficient method applicable to disordered striped patterns from biological, chemical, optical, and fluid systems. We present statistics of various local pattern properties such as the local wave-vector magnitude, local pattern orientation, and defect densities. Using these statistics, we provide quantitative evidence demonstrating that the stability boundaries derived for infinite systems are applicable to local patches within disordered patterns. We also present the first experimental observation of multiple length scales within spiral defect chaos.",
                "Far-from-equilibrium, spatially extended chaotic systems have generally eluded analytical solution, leading researchers to consider theories based on a statistical rather than a detailed knowledge of the microscopic length scales. Building on the recent discovery of a separation of length scales between macroscopic behavior and microscopic chaos, a simple far-from-equilibrium spatially extended chaotic system has been studied computationally at intermediate, coarse-grained scales. Equilibrium properties such as Gibbs distributions and detailed balance are recovered at these scales, which suggests that the macroscopic behavior of some far-from-equilibrium systems might be understood in terms of equilibrium statistical mechanics.",
                "SUSTAINED nonequiibrium systems can be characterized by a fractal dimension D\u2a7e 0, which can be considered to be a measure of the number of independent degrees of freedom 1. The dimension D is usually estimated from time series 2 but the available algorithms are unreliable and difficult to apply when D is larger than about 5 (refs 3, 4). Recent advances in experimental technique 5\u20138 and in parallel computing have now made possible the study of big systems with large fractal dimensions, raising new questions about what physical properties determine D and whether these physical properties can be used in place of time-series to estimate large fractal dimensions. Numerical simulations 9\u201311 suggest that sufficiently large homogeneous systems will generally be extensively chaotic 12, which means that D increases linearly with the system volume V. Here we test an hypothesis that follows from this \u2026",
                "For the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation on a large periodic interval, we show that the transition from defect to phase turbulence is more accurately described as a smooth crossover rather than as a sharp continuous transition. We obtain this conclusion by using a parallel computer to calculate various order parameters, especially the density of space-time defects, the Lyapunov dimension density, and correlation lengths. Remarkably, the correlation length of the field amplitude fluctuations is, within a constant factor, equal to the length scale defined by the dimension density.",
                "We describe a series of experiments and computer simulations on vibrated granular media in a geometry chosen to eliminate gravitationally induced settling. The system consists of a collection of identical spherical particles on a horizontal plate vibrating vertically, with or without a confining lid. Previously reported results are reviewed, including the observation of homogeneous, disordered liquid-like states, an instability to a'collapse'of motionless spheres on a perfect hexagonal lattice, and a fluctuating, hexagonally ordered state. In the presence of a confining lid we see a variety of solid phases at high densities and relatively high vibration amplitudes, several of which are reported for the first time in this article. The phase behaviour of the system is closely related to that observed in confined hard-sphere colloidal suspensions in equilibrium, but with modifications due to the effects of the forcing and dissipation. We \u2026",
                "For Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection in a square cell with a fluid of Prandtl number \u03c3\u2248 1, we report experimental results on the bistability of the spatiotemporal chaotic state of spiral defect chaos (SDC) and a stationary state of ideal straight rolls (ISR). We present the first large aspect ratio experimental confirmation of the theoretical prediction of stable ISR in the parameter regime where typical initial conditions lead to SDC. As a function of the control parameter and for typical experimental initial conditions, we also find a transition in the selection between SDC and ISR which is mediated by front propagation. We characterize the transition with two measures, the spatial correlation length and the spectral pattern entropy, and find that the transition shows similarities to equilibrium phase transitions."

Duke Scholar at Duke University and earned his B.S. in 1990 as a Program II major, meeting the major requirements for Physics, Chemistry, and Math. He received a Ph.D. in Physics from Duke in 1994 for his work on spatiotemporal chaos. After completing his Ph.D., he became a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Computational Science and Engineering at Cornell University working with Prof. Eberhard Bodenschatz. After his time at Cornell, he became the Richard P. Feynman Fellow for Theory and Computing at Los Alamos National Laboratory, collaborating with Dr. Robert Ecke on pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos at the Center for Nonlinear Studies. Professor Egolf has been a faculty member at Georgetown University since 2000. Professor Egolf is a computational and theoretical physicist whose research focuses on trying to understand systems far-from-equilibrium (meaning that the energy input and the energy dissipated are not precisely balanced at all times). Unlike the situation for systems in equilibrium, researchers have so far been stymied in their efforts to develop a general, predictive theory of nonequilibrium systems. His research group uses the tools of nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics to try to establish the underpinnings for such a theory. Most of the work involves the use of large-scale computation on computer clusters with hundreds or thousands CPUs. The types of systems he studies range from fluid and granular systems to electrochemical waves in heart tissue to idealized mathematical models. In addition to this work in statistical physics, Professor Egolf is part of a collaboration studying effective theories of quantum chromodynamics. His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Research Corporation, NASA, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Professor Egolf is also a dedicated teacher and was awarded the Dean\u2019s Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2008. Most years, an undergraduate or two also work with him on their senior thesis research. Dynamical Events in Fluids, Fibrillation, and Jamming The behaviors of systems far-from-equilibrium can often appear hopelessly complicated \u2014 a muddled situation with a wide variety of length scales and time scales and often a chaotic dynamics that defies prediction. We have been using the mathematical tools of nonlinear dynamics to identify within this wild behavior particular events which determine the future evolution of the system. Using massively-parallel simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection, we found that the complex behavior of the Spiral Defect Chaos state of convection is actually largely determined by particular events (convection roll breaking) that are highly localized in space and time. It is only in the vicinity of these events that the system is particularly sensitive to small perturbations, so the rest of the system, although complex-looking, is to a large degree predictable. We have been applying these same techniques to a model of fibrillating heart tissue, with the hope of inspiring the development of targeted defibrillation in which tiny electrical (or chemical) pulses can be introduced in specified portions of the heart to lead the heart out of fibrillation in a gentle way. Again, we found that particular events within the complicated chaotic dynamics of fibrillation largely determine the future behavior of the fibrillating tissue. We have also been using the same dynamical analysis techniques to study the behavior of a two-dimensional granular layer subjected to shear. Granular materials are collections of discrete, macroscopic particles characterized by relatively straightforward interactions. Despite their apparent simplicity, these systems exhibit a number of intriguing phenomena, including the jamming transition, in which a disordered collection of grains becomes rigid when its density exceeds a critical value. We have been using dynamical analysis techniques to study the behavior of a two-dimensional granular layer subjected to shear. We have found that the transition from free-flowing states to jammed states is a dynamical transition from chaotic behavior to non-chaotic behavior. We also find that the dominant cooperative dynamical modes are strongly correlated with particle rearrangements and become increasingly unstable before stress jumps, providing a way to predict the times and locations of these striking stress-release events. Building Blocks of Spatiotemporal Chaos Such complicated behavior arising from isolated events provides hope that we may be able to develop an understanding of these systems by characterizing the events and the parts of the system involved in the events (much like the way we can understand a great deal about gases by understanding atoms and the ways they interact when they get close to each other). The idea that spatiotemporal chaotic systems could be considered as a collection of weakly-interacting subsystems was originally argued by Ruelle and later expanded upon by Cross and Hohenberg and others. In a series of papers, we have explored this idea in hopes of identifying these building blocks on which to base a statistical mechanics of spatiotemporal chaos. Statistical Mechanics Far-from-equilibrium One of the reasons researchers are hopeful that a statistical mechanics of spatiotemporal chaos might be developed is that the behavior of many of these systems resembles the phase transitions of equilibrium systems. In a paper in Science, I showed that, remarkably, a coarse-graining of a simple spatiotemporal chaotic system is indistinguishable from an equilibrium system of the Ising universality class. QCD Calculations using Effective Field Theories My scientific interests are quite broad, so I occasionally work on projects far afield from my usual research. I have been working with Professor Roxanne Springer at Duke to calculate various quantities using effective theories of low energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In our most recent work, we found that a new 3-body force is required to describe the interactions of 3 nucleons when 2 of them are charged (but that force is not needed when only one is charged). In earlier work, at the request of experimentalists at Fermilab, we calculated the decay rates of doubly-heavy baryons into a variety of channels. J. Vanasse, D.A. Egolf, J. Kerin, S. Konig, and R.P.
