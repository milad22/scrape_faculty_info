                "We used fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) to analyze organelle movement by conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein in a cell. We located a green fluorescence protein (GFP)\u2013tagged peroxisome in cultured Drosophila S2 cells to within 1.5 nanometers in 1.1 milliseconds, a 400-fold improvement in temporal resolution, sufficient to determine the average step size to be \u223c8 nanometers for both dynein and kinesin. Furthermore, we found that dynein and kinesin do not work against each other in vivo during peroxisome transport. Rather, multiple kinesins or multiple dyneins work together, producing up to 10 times the in vitro speed.",
                "The centroid of a fluorophore can be determined within \u22481.5-nm accuracy from its focused image through fluorescence imaging with one-nanometer accuracy (FIONA). If, instead, the sample is moved away from the focus, the point-spread-function depends on both the position and 3D orientation of the fluorophore, which can be calculated by defocused orientation and position imaging (DOPI). DOPI does not always yield position accurately, but it is possible to switch back and forth between focused and defocused imaging, thereby getting the centroid and the orientation with precision. We have measured the 3D orientation and stepping behavior of single bifunctional rhodamine probes attached to one of the calmodulins of the light-chain domain (LCD) of myosin V as myosin V moves along actin. Concomitant with large and small steps, the LCD rotates and then dwells in the leading and trailing position, respectively \u2026",
                "We report on an extensive study of the growth and transport properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined at the interface of AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on thick, semi-insulating GaN templates prepared by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Thick (\u223c20\u2009\u03bcm) GaN templates are characterized by low threading dislocation densities (\u223c5\u00d7108\u2009cm\u22122) and by room temperature resistivities of \u223c108\u2009\u03a9\u200acm. We describe sources of parasitic conduction in our structures and how they have been minimized. The growth of low Al containing (x\u2a7d0.05) AlxGa1-xN\/GaN heterostructures is investigated. The use of low Al containing heterostructures facilitates the study of the 2DEG transport properties in the previously unexplored regime of carrier density ns\u2a7d2\u00d71012\u2009cm\u22122. We detail the impact of MBE growth conditions on low temperature mobility. Using an undoped \u2026",
                "We studied the structural dynamics of chicken myosin V by combining the localization power of fluorescent imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) with the ability to detect angular changes of a fluorescent probe. The myosin V was labeled with bifunctional rhodamine on one of its calmodulin light chains. For every 74 nm translocation, the probe exhibited two reorientational motions, associated with alternating smaller and larger translational steps. Molecules previously identified as stepping alternatively 74\u20100 nm were found to actually step 64\u201010 nm. Additional tilting often occurred without full steps, possibly indicating flexibility of the attached myosin heads or probing of their vicinity. Processive myosin V molecules sometimes shifted from the top to the side of actin, possibly to avoid an obstacle. The data indicate marked adaptability of this molecular motor to a nonuniform local environment and provide \u2026",
                "High-quality AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures have been grown by ammonia gas-source molecular-beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. Incorporation of a low-temperature-grown AlN interlayer during the growth of a thick GaN buffer is shown to substantially increase the mobility of the piezoelectrically induced two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in unintentionally doped AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures. For an optimized AlN interlayer thickness of 30 nm, electron mobilities as high as 1500 cm2\/V\u200as at room temperature, 10\u200a310 cm2\/V\u200as at 77 K, and 12\u200a000 cm2\/V\u200as at 0.3 K were obtained with sheet densities of 9\u00d71012\u200acm\u22122 and 6\u00d71012\u200acm\u22122 at room temperature and 77 K, respectively. The 2DEG was confirmed by strong and well-resolved Shubnikov\u2013de Haas oscillations starting at 3.0 T. Photoluminescence measurements and atomic force microscopy revealed that the densities of native donors and grain \u2026",
                "We present data on mobility lifetime \u03c4t, quantum lifetime \u03c4q, and cyclotron resonance lifetime \u03c4CR, of a sequence of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in the AlGaN\/GaN system, covering a density range of 1 to 4.5\u00d71012\u2002cm\u22122. We observe a large discrepancy between \u03c4q and \u03c4CR(\u03c4q\u223c\u03c4CR\/6), and explain it as the result of density fluctuations of only a few percent. Therefore, only \u03c4CR\u2014and not \u03c4q\u2014is a reliable measure of the time between electron-scattering events in these specimens. The ratio \u03c4t\/\u03c4CR increases with increasing density in this series of samples, but scattering over this density range remains predominantly in the large-angle scattering regime.",
                "Using cyclotron resonance, we measure the effective mass, m*, of electrons in AlGaN\/GaN heterostructures with densities, n2D\u223c1 to 6\u00d71012\u2009cm\u22122. From our extensive data, we extrapolate a band edge mass of (0.208\u00b10.002)me. By comparing our m* data with the results of a multiband k\u22c5p calculation, we infer that the effect of remote bands is essential in explaining the observed conduction-band nonparabolicity (NP). Our calculation of polaron mass corrections\u2014including finite width and two-dimensional (2D) screening\u2014suggests those to be negligible. It implies that the behavior of m*(n2D) can be understood solely in terms of NP. Finally, using our NP and polaron corrections, we are able to reduce the large scatter in the published band edge mass values.",
                "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) provide an excellent analysis of recordings with very poor signal\/noise ratio made from systems such as ion channels which switch among a few states. This method has also recently been used for modeling the kinetic rate constants of molecular motors, where the observable variable\u2014the position\u2014steadily accumulates as a result of the motor's reaction cycle. We present a new HMM implementation for obtaining the chemical-kinetic model of a molecular motor's reaction cycle called the variable-stepsize HMM in which the quantized position variable is represented by a large number of states of the Markov model. Unlike previous methods, the model allows for arbitrary distributions of step sizes, and allows these distributions to be estimated. The result is a robust algorithm that requires little or no user input for characterizing the stepping kinetics of molecular motors as recorded by \u2026",
                "Robust circadian oscillations of the proteins PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) are hallmarks of a functional clock in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Early morning phosphorylation of PER by the kinase Doubletime (DBT) and subsequent PER turnover is an essential step in the functioning of the Drosophila circadian clock. Here using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy we study PER stability in the presence of DBT and its short, long, arrhythmic, and inactive mutants in S2 cells. We observe robust PER degradation in a DBT allele-specific manner. With the exception of doubletime-short (DBTS), all mutants produce differential PER degradation profiles that show direct correspondence with their respective Drosophila behavioral phenotypes. The kinetics of PER degradation with DBTS in cell culture resembles that with wild-type DBT and posits that, in flies DBTS likely does not modulate the clock by simply \u2026",
                "The molecular clock relies on a delayed negative feedback loop of transcriptional regulation to generate oscillating gene expression. Although the principal components of the clock are present in all circadian neurons, different neuronal clusters have varying effects on rhythmic behavior, suggesting that the clocks they house are differently regulated. Combining biochemical and genetic techniques in Drosophila, we identify a phosphorylation program native to the master pacemaker neurons that regulates the timing of nuclear accumulation of the Period\/Timeless repressor complex. GSK-3\/SGG binds and phosphorylates Period-bound Timeless, triggering a CK2-mediated phosphorylation cascade. Mutations that block the hierarchical phosphorylation of Timeless in vitro also delay nuclear accumulation in both tissue culture and in vivo and predictably change rhythmic behavior.
