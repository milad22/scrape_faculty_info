                "KamLAND has measured the flux of \u03bd e\u2019s from distant nuclear reactors. We find fewer \u03bd e events than expected from standard assumptions about \u03bd e propagation at the 99.95% CL In a 162 ton\u00b7 y r exposure the ratio of the observed inverse \u03b2-decay events to the expected number without \u03bd e disappearance is 0.611\u00b10.085 (s t a t)\u00b10.041 (s y s t) for \u03bd e energies> 3.4 M e V. In the context of two-flavor neutrino oscillations with CPT invariance, all solutions to the solar neutrino problem except for the \u201clarge mixing angle\u201d region are excluded.",
                "We present results of a study of neutrino oscillation based on a 766 ton\/year exposure of KamLAND to reactor antineutrinos. We observe 258 \u03bd e candidate events with energies above 3.4 MeV compared to 365.2\u00b123.7 events expected in the absence of neutrino oscillation. Accounting for 17.8\u00b17.3 expected background events, the statistical significance for reactor \u03bd e disappearance is 99.998%. The observed energy spectrum disagrees with the expected spectral shape in the absence of neutrino oscillation at 99.6% significance and prefers the distortion expected from \u03bd e oscillation effects. A two-neutrino oscillation analysis of the KamLAND data gives \u0394 m 2= 7.9\u2212 0.5+ 0.6\u00d7 10\u2212 5 e V 2. A global analysis of data from KamLAND and solar-neutrino experiments yields \u0394 m 2= 7.9\u2212 0.5+ 0.6\u00d7 10\u2212 5 e V 2 and tan\ufeff 2 \u03b8= 0.40\u2212 0.07+ 0.10, the most precise determination to date.",
                "We review and analyze the available information on the nuclear-fusion cross sections that are most important for solar energy generation and solar neutrino production. We provide best values for the low-energy cross-section factors and, wherever possible, estimates of the uncertainties. We also describe the most important experiments and calculations that are required in order to improve our knowledge of solar fusion rates.",
                "Data corresponding to a KamLAND detector exposure of 0.28 kton yr has been used to search for \u03bd e\u2019s in the energy range 8.3< E \u03bd e< 14.8 M e V. No candidates were found for an expected background of 1.1\u00b10.4 events. This result can be used to obtain a limit on \u03bd e fluxes of any origin. Assuming that all \u03bd e flux has its origin in the Sun and has the characteristic B 8 solar \u03bd e energy spectrum, we obtain an upper limit of 3.7\u00d7 10 2 c m\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 (90% CL) on the \u03bd e flux. We interpret this limit, corresponding to 2.8\u00d7 10\u2212 4 of the standard solar model B 8 \u03bd e flux, in the framework of spin-flavor precession and neutrino decay models.",
                "Parity nonconservation was studied for seventeen states in U 239 by measuring the helicity dependence of the total cross section for epithermal neutrons scattered from U 238. The root-mean-squared parity-violating matrix element for the mixing of p-wave and s-wave states was determined to be M= 0. 58\u2212 0.25+ 0.50 meV. This corresponds to a parity-violating spreading width of \u0393 PV= 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 7 eV. Under plausible assumptions this gives a value of 4\u00d7 10\u2212 7 for\u2016 \u03b1 P\u2016, the ratio of strengths of the P-odd and P-even effective nucleon-nucleon interactions.",
                "Parity-nonconserving longitudinal analyzing powers were measured for 23 p-wave neutron resonances in Th 232. Seven resonances show effects of greater than 2\u03c3 statistical significance (95% confidence)\u2014the largest sample yet measured in a single nucleus. All seven analyzing powers have positive sign. Strong sign correlations are not a feature of the conventional statistical model of parity mixing between compound nuclear states. The results suggest that the mechanism of parity violation in resonance reactions is more complicated than previously assumed.",
                "We reanalyze Oklo Sm 149 data using realistic models of the natural nuclear reactors. Disagreements among recent Oklo determinations of the time evolution of \u03b1, the electromagnetic fine structure constant, are shown to be due to different reactor models, which led to different neutron spectra used in the calculations. We use known Oklo reactor epithermal spectral indices as criteria for selecting realistic reactor models. Two Oklo reactors, RZ2 and RZ10, were modeled with MCNP. The resulting neutron spectra were used to calculate the change in the Sm 149 effective neutron capture cross section as a function of a possible shift in the energy of the 97.3-meV resonance. We independently deduce ancient Sm 149 effective cross sections and use these values to set limits on the time variation of \u03b1. Our study resolves a contradictory situation with previous Oklo \u03b1 results. Our suggested 2 \u03c3 bound on a possible time \u2026",
                "Parity nonconserving (PNC) longitudinal analyzing powers were measured for 23 p-wave neutron resonances in Th 232. Seven resonances show effects of greater than 2.4 \u03c3 statistical significance\u2014the largest sample yet measured in a single nucleus. All seven analyzing powers have positive sign. Strong sign correlations are not a feature of the conventional statistical model of parity mixing between compound nuclear states. The asymmetry was expressed as a sum of two terms: a constant asymmetry and a fluctuating asymmetry. With this ansatz the root-mean-square PNC matrix element M= 1. 2\u2212 0.4+ 0.5 meV, which corresponds to a spreading width of \u0393 PV= 6\u00d7 10\u2212 7 eV.",
                "An optical model analysis of results from a program of neutron time-of-flight measurements of elastic scattering from the 1\u2212 p shell nuclei is described. Experiments have been carried out at the TUNL FN Tandem van de Graaff facility using the H 2 (d, n) He 3 reaction as a neutron source. Experimental methods and past results for neutron scattering from Li 6, Li 7, Be 9, B 10, B 11, C 12, C 13, and O 16 are summarized. Data have generally been accumulated at bombarding energies from 7 to 15 MeV in 1-MeV steps, at scattering angles from 25 to 160. Cross sections are compared to previous work. Much of the neutron scattering data is well described by the spherical optical model, particularly for nuclei in which resonance structure is not prominent. However, spherical optical model parameters for heavier nuclei do not reproduce the data well. Parameter sets for the individual nuclei are presented along with the \u2026",
                "Differential cross sections were measured at 8, 10, 12 and 14 MeV for elastic scattering of neutrons from enriched samples of 54Fe, 56Fe, 63Cu and 65Cu. Inelastic scattering to the first excited state in 54, 56Fe was also observed. For the 63, 65Cu isotopes, the inelastic cross sections for scattering to the combined group of the three (five) states were determined at 8 and 10 MeV (12 and 14 MeV). The elastic scattering data are compared to predictions of earlier global optical models. New spherical optical model representations were obtained. These data were combined with data for nickel, tin and lead to generate a new global parametrization. Comparisons of derived volume integrals for the potentials, total cross sections and potential radii are made to available information."
