                "Applying Dickey\u2010Fuller time series techniques in tandem with intuitive plot\u2010displays, we examine recent trends in girls' violence and the gender gap as reported in four major sources of longitudinal data on youth violence. These sources are arrest statistics of the Uniform Crime Reports, victimization data of the National Crime Victimization Survey (where the victim identifies sex of offender) and self\u2010reported violent behavior of Monitoring the Future and National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. We find that the rise in girls' violence over the past one to two decades as counted in police arrest data from the Uniform Crime Reports is not borne out in unofficial longitudinal sources. Several net\u2010widening policy shifts have apparently escalated girls' arrest\u2010proneness: first, stretching definitions of violence to include more minor incidents that girls in relative terms are more likely to commit; second, increased policing of violence \u2026",
                "Context: Fatigue and underperformance are common in athletes. Understanding overtraining syndrome (OTS) is helpful in the evaluation, management, and education of athletes.Evidence Acquisition: Relevant articles in English were searched with OVID (1948-2011) and PubMed using the following keywords: overtraining syndrome, overtraining, overreaching, unexplained underperformance, staleness, pathophysiology, management, treatment, evaluation. Bibliographies were reviewed for additional resources.Results: OTS appears to be a maladapted response to excessive exercise without adequate rest, resulting in perturbations of multiple body systems (neurologic, endocrinologic, immunologic) coupled with mood changes. Many hypotheses of OTS pathogenesis are reviewed, and a clinical approach to athletes with possible OTS (including history, testing, and prevention) is presented.Conclusions: OTS \u2026",
                "We extend the scarce research on corporate crime to include gender by developing and testing a gendered focal concerns and crime opportunities framework that predicts minimal and marginal female involvement in corporate criminal networks. Lacking centralized information, we developed a rich database covering 83 corporate frauds involving 436 defendants. We extracted information from indictments and secondary sources on corporate conspiracy networks (e.g., co-conspirator roles, company positions, and distribution of profit). Findings support the gendered paradigm. Typically, women were not part of conspiracy groups. When women were involved, they had more minor roles and made less profit than their male co-conspirators. Two main pathways defined female involvement: relational (close personal relationship with a main male co-conspirator) and utility (occupied a financial-gateway corporate \u2026",
                "The authors examine 1980 to 2003 trends in female-to-male interpersonal violence reported in Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) arrest statistics and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) victimization data. Augmented Dickey-Fuller time-series techniques and intuitive plot displays show much overlap yet differences in each source\u2019s portrayal of trends in female violence levels and the gender gap. Both sources show little or no change in the gender gap for homicide and rape\/sexual assault, whereas UCR police counts show a sharp rise in female-to-male arrests for criminal assault during the past one to two decades\u2014but that rise is not borne out in NCVS counts. Net-widening policy shifts have apparently escalated the arrest proneness of females for \u201ccriminal assault\u201d (e.g., policing physical attacks\/threats of marginal seriousness that women in relative terms are more likely to commit); rather than women having \u2026",
                "Constructionist theories suggest the national rise in female violence arrests may be policy generated because arrest statistics are produced by violent behavior and changing official responses (e.g., net-widening enforcement policies). Normative theories attribute the rise to female behavior changes (e.g., in response to increased freedoms or hardships). We examine whether any narrowing of the arrest gender gap is borne out across offense types of varying measurement reliability, in victimization data, and across two post-arrest criminal justice stages. Advanced time-series analyses over 1980 through 2003 support the constructionist position. First, all sources show little or no increase in women's rates for the more reliably measured offenses of homicide and robbery, and for rape. Second, the assault gender gap narrows for arrests, but holds stable in victimization data. And, third, the assault gender gap \u2026",
                "In this chapter, the authors review the nature of female offending and advance a paradigm that builds on existing theory and work on gender. The authors begin by presenting an overview of pat-terns of female offending and the\" gender gap\" and contend that nowhere is the gender ratio more skewed than in the great disparity of males as offend ers and females as victims of sexual and domestic abuse. The authors introduce a gendered paradigm for explaining female crime first sketched elsewhere and explain how gendered theory is differ-ent from gender-specific theories. The gendered paradigm is then used to illu-minate more specifically the nature and context of female offending.On one hand, the authors adopt the position that in spite of their androcentric origins, traditional structural and so-cial process theories (even though they are based on studies of men) are rela-tively gender neutral and help explain female and male crime at a general level. On the other hand, the authors contend that many of the subtle and profound differences between female and male offending patterns may be better understood by a gendered approach that takes into account the continued profound differences between the lives of women and men that shape the different patterns of offending. The authors highlight the fact that rather than equality between the sexes",
                "This study investigated the effects of sleep extension on tennis serving accuracy, as well as daytime sleepiness in college varsity tennis players.Twelve (seven females and five males) healthy students on a college varsity tennis team maintained their habitual sleep\u2013wake schedule for a one-week baseline period followed by a one-week sleep extension period. Participants were requested to sleep at least nine hours, including naps, during the sleep extension period. Serving accuracy was assessed when participants were sleep deprived (prior to the sleep extension period) and after the sleep extension period. Levels of daytime sleepiness were monitored via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and caffeine consumption was recorded throughout the study.Participants slept significantly more in the second week \u2014 the sleep extension week \u2014 compared with \u2026",
                "Lauritsen, Heimer, and Lynch (hereafter LHL)(2009, this issue) had an ambitious goal-\" to resolve the gender gap debate\" over increases in female-to-male violence that has been ongoing since the 1970s (and perhaps earlier). Based on a gender gap comparison of Uniform Crime Report (UCR) arrest trends with National Crime Survey (NCS) and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) incident trends, LHL concluded that Adler's (1975) claim of a long-term decline in the violence gender gap is now confirmed, and the authors urged researchers to\" move beyond the debate over whether these changes in offending by gender have occurred.\" Their conclusion diverged with our work (Schwartz, Steffensmeier, and Feldmeyer, 2009; Steffensmeier et al., 2005, 2006), based on victim data as well as on self-reports, post-arrest statistics, and",
                "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are more common in female athletes because of anatomic and biomechanical factors. These injuries can have detrimental ramifications for the athlete and the health care system. Neuromuscular training programs have been designed to modify risk factors and prevent ACL injuries.This systematic review evaluates studies that assess the effectiveness of neuromuscular training programs in reducing ACL injuries in female athletes and provides an update to 2 previously published reviews.Systematic review.Medline, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant journal articles published from 1995 to 2011. We performed a manual review of relevant articles, authors, and journals, including bibliographies from identified articles. Ten studies were included in this review.Only 2 studies demonstrated a \u2026",
                " Utilizing 2000 data on 1,618 counties and seemingly unrelated regression, I assess whether family structure effects on homicide vary across family structure measures and gender. There is evidence of robust, multidimensional family structure effects across constructs reflecting the presence of two\u2010parent families: mother\/father absence, shortages of employed men, and nonmarital\/teen childbearing. Findings indicate mainly gender similarity in family structural sources of homicide, but subtle gender differences include stronger effects on male homicide patterns and female\u2010specific mediating effects of the care burden on homicide. Further exploration of diverse family constructs is warranted, but, methodologically, father absence is adequate as a control for family structure. Public policies and social programs aimed at strengthening families could lessen violence among both women and men. "
