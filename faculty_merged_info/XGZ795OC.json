                "Daniel L. Jafferis Daniel L. Jafferis Professor of Physics The research of Daniel Jafferis involves string theory, supersymmetric quantum field theory, and quantum gravity. String theory unifies many fundamental questions in theoretical physics, including the search for a complete description of quantum gravity, and the behavior of systems at strong coupling. Jafferis was one of the discoverers of the low energy three dimensional superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theory describing multiple M2 branes, which led to a new concrete arena for the gauge-gravity correspondence. His past work on supersymmetric quantum field theories in three dimensions involved finding an exact method for determining the dimensions of all chiral primary operators in strongly coupled conformal field theories, and the formulation a monotonic quantity for all renormalization group flows in three dimensions. Jafferis's current research focuses on understanding quantum gravity using the gauge\/gravity correspondence, entanglement entropy, and exact results in supersymmetric systems. ____________________________________ Administrative Support: Stephanie Clayman Jefferson Lab 475 17 Oxford St. jafferis@fas.harvard.edu p: (617) 384-9488 Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature List of Publications"
