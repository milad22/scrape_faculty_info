                "We demonstate a laser-cooled Cs fountain which can be used as a frequency standard. The fountain has been used to measure the frequency shift due to ultracold Cs-Cs collisions at temperatures below 2.8 \u03bcK. The measured shift is-12.9\u00b10.7 mHz for a density of (2.7\u00b11.5)\u00d7 10 9 cm\u2212 3 beginning with an even distribution (\u00b110%) among the F= 3, m F states. For a fountain with 95% of the atoms in the m F= 0 states, we measure a frequency shift of-5.5\u00b10.5 mHz at a density of (3.5\u00b12.0)\u00d7 10 8 cm\u2212 3."
