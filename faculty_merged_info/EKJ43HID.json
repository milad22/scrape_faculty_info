                "Adding optical functionality to a silicon microelectronic chip is one of the most challenging problems of materials research. Silicon is an indirect-bandgap semiconductor and so is an inefficient emitter of light. For this reason, integration of optically functional elements with silicon microelectronic circuitry has largely been achieved through the use of direct-bandgap compound semiconductors. For optoelectronic applications, the key device is the light source\u2014a laser. Compound semiconductor lasers exploit low-dimensional electronic systems, such as quantum wells and quantum dots, as the active optical amplifying medium. Here we demonstrate that light amplification is possible using silicon itself, in the form of quantum dots dispersed in a silicon dioxide matrix. Net optical gain is seen in both waveguide and transmission configurations, with the material gain being of the same order as that of direct-bandgap \u2026",
                " We report the direct observation of laboratory production of spherical, carbonaceous particles \u2013 \"tar balls\" \u2013 from smoldering combustion of two commonly occurring dry mid-latitude fuels. Real-time measurements of spectrally varying absorption \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m coefficients (AAC) indicate that a class of light absorbing organic carbon (OC) with wavelength dependent imaginary part of its refractive index \u2013 optically defined as \"brown carbon\" \u2013 is an important component of tar balls. The spectrum of the imaginary parts of their complex refractive indices can be described with a Lorentzian-like model with an effective resonance wavelength in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region. Sensitivity calculations for aerosols containing traditional OC (no absorption at visible and UV wavelengths) and brown carbon suggest that accounting for near-UV absorption by brown carbon leads to an increase in aerosol radiative forcing efficiency and increased light absorption. Since particles from smoldering combustion account for nearly three-fourths of the total carbonaceous aerosol mass emitted globally, inclusion of the optical properties of tar balls into radiative forcing models has significance for the Earth's radiation budget, optical remote sensing, and understanding of anomalous UV absorption in the troposphere.",
                "Narrow\u2010band color filters have been integrated on porous silicon layers. Distributed Bragg reflectors and Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interference filters based on layered porous silicon samples are demonstrated. The effects of narrowing and tuning the porous silicon emission band are shown in structures composed by Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot filters integrated on top of thick porous silicon layers.",
                "An inter-comparison study of instruments designed to measure the microphysical and optical properties of soot particles was completed. The following mass-based instruments were tested: Couette Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer (CPMA), Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer\u2014Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (AMS-SMPS), Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), Soot Particle-Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) and Photoelectric Aerosol Sensor (PAS2000CE). Optical instruments measured absorption (photoacoustic, interferometric, and filter-based), scattering (in situ), and extinction (light attenuation within an optical cavity). The study covered an experimental matrix consisting of 318 runs that systematically tested the performance of instruments across a range of parameters including: fuel equivalence ratio (1.8 \u2264  \u03c6  \u2264 5), particle shape (mass-mobility exponent ( D    fm  ), 2.0  \u2264  D      fm   \u2264 3.0 \u2026",
                "Biomass burning is one of the largest sources of carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere, significantly affecting earth\u2019s radiation budget and climate. Tar balls, abundant in biomass burning smoke, absorb sunlight and have highly variable optical properties, typically not accounted for in climate models. Here we analyse single biomass burning particles from the Las Conchas fire (New Mexico, 2011) using electron microscopy. We show that the relative abundance of tar balls (80%) is 10 times greater than soot particles (8%). We also report two distinct types of tar balls; one less oxidized than the other. Furthermore, the mixing of soot particles with other material affects their optical, chemical and physical properties. We quantify the morphology of soot particles and classify them into four categories:~ 50% are embedded (heavily coated),~ 34% are partly coated,~ 12% have inclusions and~ 4% are bare.

                "A comprehensive dataset of microphysical and radiative properties of aerosols and clouds in the boundary layer in the vicinity of Barrow, Alaska, was collected in April 2008 during the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC). ISDAC's primary aim was to examine the effects of aerosols, including those generated by Asian wildfires, on clouds that contain both liquid and ice. ISDAC utilized the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Pro- gram's permanent observational facilities at Barrow and specially deployed instruments measuring aerosol, ice fog, precipitation, and radiation. The National Research Council of Canada Convair-580 flew 27 sorties and collected data using an unprecedented 41 stateof- the-art cloud and aerosol instruments for more than 100 h on 12 different days. Aerosol compositions, including fresh and processed sea salt, biomassburning particles, organics, and sulfates mixed with \u2026",
                "Black carbon (BC) and light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC) play key roles in warming the atmosphere, but the magnitude of their effects remains highly uncertain. Theoretical modelling and laboratory experiments demonstrate that coatings on BC can enhance BC\u2019s light absorption, therefore many climate models simply assume enhanced BC absorption by a factor of\u223c 1.5. However, recent field observations show negligible absorption enhancement, implying models may overestimate BC\u2019s warming. Here we report direct evidence of substantial field-measured BC absorption enhancement, with the magnitude strongly depending on BC coating amount. Increases in BC coating result from a combination of changing sources and photochemical aging processes. When the influence of BrC is accounted for, observationally constrained model calculations of the BC absorption enhancement can be \u2026",
                "We demonstrate the preparation of narrow\u2010band porous\u2010silicon reflectors integrated on porous\u2010silicon layers by electrochemical etching. By carefully tuning the resulting photon cavity mode around the maximum of the porous silicon photoluminescence, we have obtained both a narrowing and enhancement of the emission line, and a highly concentrated radiation pattern. These results show that the porous silicon spontaneous emission is modified because of the coupling with the photon cavity mode.",
                "We report the experimental investigation of the optical properties of porous silicon embedded in a planar microcavity structure in which both the active layer and the two Bragg reflectors are fabricated by electrochemical processing of a p-type porous silicon wafer. By tuning the cavity resonance energy around the maximum of the porous silicon emission we have observed photoluminescence linewidths as narrow as 18\u201325 meV and an intensity enhancement of more than one order of magnitude. The experimental results are clarified by theoretical calculations performed with the standard transfer-matrix approach in the framework of a porous silicon quantum-box model."
