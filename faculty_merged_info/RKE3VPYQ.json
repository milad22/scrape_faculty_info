The Simons Array is a ground-based array of 3 telescopes located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.\u00a0\u00a0My work as a graduate student focuses on the development and validation of the cryogenic receivers that sit at the focus of each of these telescopes, and in particular characterizing pieces of the receivers\u2019 readout system.\u00a0\u00a0I also work on designing accessory pieces and enclosures for the telescopes and am involved in the integration of all these components at the observatory site.
