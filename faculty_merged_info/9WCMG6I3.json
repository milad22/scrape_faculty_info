                "COLLEGE MEN AND MASCULINITIES is a comprehensive handbook that offers a compilation of the best classic and contemporary research on male students in higher education. The editors, Shaun R. Harper and Frank Harris III\u2014two experts in the field of men and masculinities\u2014frame each of the six sections of the book with a summary of issues and implications for educational practice. Each section also includes a wealth of forward-thinking strategies and suggestions that faculty and institutional leaders can creatively employ on their campuses to reverse problematic trends and outcomes among male undergraduates. With contributions from leading scholars in education, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines, College Men and Masculinities explores the following issues in depth: Identity development and gender socialization Sexualities and sexual orientations Destructive behaviors (judicial offenses, alcohol abuse, and violence) Health and wellness College men of color College men and sports This vital resource will help educators and administrators address the alarming trends and issues that arise from identity-related challenges among boys and college men.\" What a valuable resource! This book includes some of the most influential research and theory on all aspects of collegiate masculinity\u2014from sports to spirituality, hazing to hook-ups, and alcohol to assault. Always sensitive to how different groups of men experience college life, Harper and Harris's book will surely become the touchstone text for those who work with or study college men.\"\u2014Michael Kimmel, author of Manhood in America and professor of sociology, Stony \u2026",
                "A substantial body of scholarship on men of color in postsecondary education has emerged since the late 1990s. Yet, only recently have scholars begun to pursue empirical insights about the status of men of color who attend community colleges. In an effort to inform future research, this article reviews the published scholarship on student success for men of color in community colleges. The 5 domains of African American male student success in community colleges proposed by Wood and Harris (2012) served as a conceptual framework for reviewing and discussing the published scholarship. Following the review of scholarship, knowledge gaps and implications for future research on men of color in community colleges are offered.",
                "Based on a grounded theory study involving 68 male undergraduates, a conceptual model of the meanings college men ascribe to masculinities is proposed in this article. The participants equated masculinities with \u201cbeing respected,\u201d\u201cbeing confident and self-assured,\u201d\u201cassuming responsibility,\u201d and \u201cembodying physical prowess.\u201d Contextual factors that influenced these meanings are also reflected in the model. Using the model as a guiding framework, recommendations for supporting the gender identity development of college men and implications for future studies of masculinities in college contexts are offered.",
                "Previous research has neglected to explore identities and development among male students at community colleges. This chapter provides some insight into who these men are, their precollege gender socialization experiences, and conflicts that impede the development of productive masculinities.",
                "Using theories and concepts relating to the social construction of Black masculinity and male gender role conflict, the authors explored contextualized meanings of masculinities and corresponding behavioral expressions among 22 Black men enrolled at a private research university. The concepts of toughness, aggressiveness, material wealth, restrictive emotionality, and responsibility underscored the meanings the participants ascribed to masculinities.Participants expressed these concepts behaviorally through their pursuit of leadership and academic success, homophobia, and the fear of femininity, and through the sexist and constrained relationships they experienced with women. Based on the findings, practical implications for supporting the gender identity development and success of Black men during their undergraduate years are offered, as are recommendations for future research on the gender-related \u2026",
                "Conceptions of masculinities among African American male student athletes are considered in this article. Grounded in the social constructivist perspective and guided by the phenomenological qualitative research tradition, individual interviews were conducted with 27 academically driven African American male student-athletes attending four Division I universities. Findings suggest that the participants embrace a wide range of productive gender-related attitudes and behaviors that are uncommon among male college student-athletes. Implications and recommendations are offered for coaches and university administrators charged with working with African American male student-athletes.",
                "The report aims to provide a summary of policy\u2013relevant trends and issues concerning Black male college students; to offer a snapshot of current initiatives that aim to address the problematic condition of college success for Black undergraduate men; and to propose a role for policymakers at all levels\u2014 institutional, federal, and state\u2014as well as other relevant groups such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and influential organizations such as foundations, community\u2013based organizations, and higher education associations in improving Black men\u2019s educational outcomes and postsecondary degree attainment rates.",
                "The Equity Scorecard, a nationally recognized and widely used organizational learning process designed to foster institutional change through the identification and elimination of racial disparities among college students, is described in this chapter. The effectiveness of this process and its potential impact are also discussed.",

                "As is the case in most K-12 schools, male students, in comparison to their female counterparts, disproportionately violate policies and are sanctioned more often for violence and disruptive behaviors on college and university campuses across the country. A theoretical model to explain this phenomenon is proposed in this article. Specifically, a synthesis of existing literature and theories from sociology, psychology, men\u2019s studies, and education resulted in the identification of six acute variables that explain male overrepresentation among campus judicial offenders. While each component of the model is thoroughly explained, insight into interactions among the six variables is also offered. Practical implications for campus administrators who are interested in minimizing violence and disruptive behaviors among college men conclude the article."
