                "Aurel Bulgac Professor bulgac@uw.edu 206-685-2988 B478 Nuclear Theory Biography Quantum many-body nuclear physics and related systems. My research is lately focused on the structure, phase transitions and dynamic properties of strongly interacting systems of many fermions, typically nucleons and cold atoms. I employ a wide spectrum of many-body techniques, among them: quantum Monte Carlo for evaluation path integrals, density functional theory, high performance computing on leadership class computers. Our research explores a wide range of questions in contemporary nuclear theory and related fields, from the description of nuclear few-body systems with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the lattice to aspects of nucleon structure and fundamental symmetries to the properties (structure, phase transitions and dynamics) of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. Our research utilizes tools from effective field theory as well as high-performance computing on leadership class computers.
