                "The reactions of metal clusters with small molecules often depend on cluster size. The selectivity of oxygen reactions with aluminum cluster anions can be well described within an electronic shell model; however, not all reactions are subject to the same fundamental constraints. We observed the size selectivity of aluminum cluster anion reactions with water, which can be attributed to the dissociative chemisorption of water at specific surface sites. The reactivity depends on geometric rather than electronic shell structure. Identical arrangements of multiple active sites in Al16\u2013, Al17\u2013, and Al18\u2013 result in the production of H2 from water.",
                "The quantum states in metal clusters are grouped into bunches of close-lying eigenvalues, termed electronic shells, similar to those of atoms. Filling of the electronic shells with paired electrons results in local minima in energy to give stable species called magic clusters. This led to the realization that selected clusters mimic chemical properties of elemental atoms on the periodic table and can be classified as superatoms. So far the work on superatoms has focused on non-magnetic species. Here we propose a framework for magnetic superatoms by invoking systems that have both localized and delocalized electronic states, in which localized electrons stabilize magnetic moments and filled nearly-free electron shells lead to stable species. An isolated VCs 8 and a ligated MnAu 24 (SH) 18 are shown to be such magnetic superatoms. The magnetic superatoms' assemblies could be ideal for molecular electronic \u2026",
                "It has recently been demonstrated that chosen clusters of specific size and composition can exhibit behaviors reminiscent of atoms in the periodic table and hence can be regarded as superatoms forming a third dimension. An Al13 cluster has been shown to mimic the behavior of halogen atoms. Here, we demonstrate that superatom compounds formed by combining superhalogens (Al13) with superalkalis (K3O and Na3O) can exhibit novel chemical and tunable electronic features. For example, Al13(K3O)3 is shown to have low first and second ionization potentials of 2.49 and 4.64 eV, respectively, which are lower than alkali atoms and can be regarded as ultra alkali motifs. Al13K3O is shown to be a strongly bound molecule that can be assembled into stable superatom assemblies (Al13K3O)n with Al13 and K3O as the superatom building blocks. The studies illustrate the potential of creating new materials with an \u2026",
                "It is shown that spin accommodation plays a determining role in the reactivity of aluminum based anion clusters with oxygen. Experimental reactivity studies on aluminum and aluminum\u2212hydrogen clusters show variable reactivity in even electron systems and rapid etching in odd electron systems. The reactivity of even electron clusters is governed by a spin transfer to the singlet cluster through filling of the spin down antibonding orbitals on triplet oxygen. Theoretical investigations show that when the spin transfer cannot occur, the species is unreactive. When spin accommodation is possible, more subtle effects appear, such as the required spin excitation energy, which raises the total energy of the system, and the filling of the antibonding levels of the O2 molecule, which is stabilized by becoming an aluminum oxygen \u03c0 bond. This explanation is consistent with observed behavior in oxygen etching reactions with a \u2026",
                "One pathway toward nanomaterials with controllable band gaps is to assemble solids where atomic clusters serve as building blocks, since the electronic structures of clusters vary with size and composition. To study the role of organization in cluster assemblies, we synthesized multiple architectures incorporating As73\u2212 clusters through control of the countercations. Optical measurements revealed that the band gaps vary from 1.1\u22122.1 eV, even though the assemblies are constructed from the identical cluster building block. Theoretical studies explain this variation as being a result of altering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels by changing the countercations. Additional variations in the gap are made by covalently linking the clusters with species of varying electronegativity to alter the degree of charge transfer. These findings offer a general protocol for syntheses of nanoassemblies with tunable electronic \u2026",
                "The relative role of electronic and geometric effects on the stability of clusters has been a contentious topic for quite some time, with the focus on electronic structure generally gaining the upper hand. In this Account, we hope to demonstrate that both electronic shell filling and geometric shell filling are necessary concepts for an intuitive understanding of the reactivity of metal clusters. This work will focus on the reactivity of aluminum based clusters, although these concepts may be applied to clusters of different metals and ligand protected clusters. First we highlight the importance of electronic shell closure in the stability of metallic clusters. Quantum confinement in small compact metal clusters results in the bunching of quantum states that are reminiscent of the electronic shells in atoms. Clusters with closed electronic shells and large HOMO\u2013LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital\u2013lowest unoccupied \u2026"
