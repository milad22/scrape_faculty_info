Crystallographic datafor Cp'2LaNHCH3 (H2NCH3) at-120 C were as follows: Plfn, Z= 4, a= 19.901 (4) A, b= 11.695 (3) A, c= 20.202 (3) A, \u00df= 97.95 (2), and R (F)= 0.049 for 3296 independent reflections with I> 2.58< r (7). Two independent molecules crystallize per unit cell with average La-NHCH3 and La<-NH2CH3 bond distances of 2.31 (1) and 2.70 (1) A, respectively. The two molecules differ slightly in relative orientations of the NCH3 groups. The amine-amido complexes undergo rapidintramolecular proton transfer between amine and amido ligands (< 7*= 12.4 \u0105 0.5 kcal mol\u2122 1).

                "A modular approach to the synthesis of a class of mixed phosphorus\/sulfur ligands was designed to identify important ligand structural features for enantioselective palladium-catalyzed allylic subsitutions of acyclic and cyclic ayllic esters. After a systematic variation of the ligand substituents at sulfur, phosphorus, and the ligand backbone, ligand 11k was found to be optimal in the palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution of 1,3-diphenylpropenyl acetate with dimethyl malonate or benzylamine in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity (95\u221298% ee). A similar optimization of the mixed phosphorus\/sulfur ligand for the palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution of cycloalkenyl acetates showed that 49g afforded the highest enantioselectivities (91\u221297% ee). Application of this methodology to heterocyclic substrates was developed as an efficient approach to the enantioselective synthesis of 3-substituted piperidines and \u2026",

The in situ generation, or preformation, of a palladium tosylate emerges as a key parameter in gaining the requisite reactivity for the C\u2212H insertion\/carbopalladation\/nucleophilic displacement process.",
                "The Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction enjoys a prominent historical position in synthesis methodology, 1 and milder variants of this process utilizing trivalent lanthanide catalysts continue to improve the utility of thisreaction for the reduction of ketones. 2 The purpose of this communication is to report an enantioselective variantof the MPV reduction which is catalyzed by a chiral samarium (III) complex at ambient temperatures in 2-propanol. 3 On the basis of precedent established by Kagan, 2 a range of Sm (III) complexes were generated from freshly prepared Simla and chiral bi-and tridentate ligands. These complexes were screened as catalysts in the reduction of o-chloroacetophenone (25 equiv of 2-propanol, 25 C)(eq 1). This screening process",
                "The electrophilic activation of alkenes by transition\u2010metal catalysts is a fundamental step in a rapidly growing number of catalytic processes. Although palladium is the best known metal for this purpose, the special properties of its third\u2010row cousin platinum (strong metal\u2013ligand bonds and slow substitution kinetics) have enabled the development of transformations that are initiated by addition to the C\uf8feC bonds by protic carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus nucleophiles, as well as alkene or arene nucleophiles. Additionally, reactivity profiles, which are often unique to platinum, provide wholly new reaction products. This Review concerns platinum\u2010catalyzed electrophilic alkene activation reactions, with a special emphasis on the mechanistic properties of known systems, on the differences between platinum and palladium catalysts, and on the prospects for the development of new systems.",
                "Gold (I)-catalyzed carbon\u2013carbon bond-forming reactions continue to fascinate the synthetic community but are less well investigated than many conventional metal catalysts.[1] In many cases a cationic gold (I) species activates an unsaturated C\u00c0C bond and isomerizes or functionalizes it to build molecular complexity via reactive intermediates which include gold\u2013\u03c0 complexes, gold\u2013vinyl species, and gold\u2013carbene species. Support for these intermediates is mainly based on gold (I) organometallic chemistry, though computational studies and the isolation of proposed catalytic intermediates have been reported.[2\u20135] We report mechanistic studies on a seemingly simple gold (I)-catalyzed reaction and demonstrate the importance of dinuclear organometallic intermediates. Whereas similar dinuclear species have been postulated on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) studies,[5b] di-gold intermediates have \u2026",

Whilst a range of efficient catalyst systems have recently been reported, it is of note that nearly all of them require high temperatures and\/or powerful oxidants.[1] Indeed, the development of an effective catalytic protocol for carbonylation using CO by palladium (II)-mediated C\u00c0H activation has long been recognized as being difficult and only recently has the first example been reported.[2] Herein we report a room-temperature, ureadirected, palladium-catalyzed carbonylation that provides access to biologically and synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives and heterocycles under mild conditions.",
