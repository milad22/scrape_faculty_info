                "This Letter reports the first scientific results from the observation of antineutrinos emitted by fission products of U 235 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. PROSPECT, the Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, consists of a segmented 4 ton Li 6-doped liquid scintillator detector covering a baseline range of 7\u20139 m from the reactor and operating under less than 1 m water equivalent overburden. Data collected during 33 live days of reactor operation at a nominal power of 85 MW yield a detection of 25 461\u00b1283 (stat) inverse beta decays. Observation of reactor antineutrinos can be achieved in PROSPECT at 5 \u03c3 statistical significance within 2 h of on-surface reactor-on data taking. A reactor model independent analysis of the inverse beta decay prompt energy spectrum as a function of baseline constrains significant portions of the previously allowed sterile neutrino oscillation parameter space at 95 \u2026"
