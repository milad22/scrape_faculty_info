                "The timing of the end-Permian mass extinction and subsequent prolonged recovery during the Early Triassic Epoch can be established from astronomically controlled climate cycles recorded in continuous marine sedimentary sections. Astronomical-cycle tuning of spectral gamma-ray logs from biostratigraphically-constrained cyclic stratigraphy through marine sections at Meishan, Chaohu, Daxiakou and Guandao in South China yields an integrated time scale for the Early Triassic, which is consistent with scaling of magnetostratigraphy from climatic cycles in continental deposits of the Germanic Basin. The main marine mass extinction interval at Meishan is constrained to less than 40% of a 100-kyr (kilo-year) cycle (ie,< 40 kyr) and the sharp negative excursion in \u03b4 C 13 is estimated to have lasted< 6 kyr. The sharp positive shift in \u03b4 C 13 from\u2212 2\u2030 to 4\u2030 across the Smithian\u2013Spathian boundary at Chaohu was \u2026",
                "Continental breakup represents the successful process of rifting and thinning of the continental lithosphere, leading to plate rupture and initiation of oceanic crust formation. Magmatism during breakup seems to follow a path of either excessive, transient magmatism (magma-rich margins) or of igneous starvation (magma-poor margins). The latter type is characterized by extreme continental lithospheric extension and mantle exhumation prior to igneous oceanic crust formation. Discovery of magma-poor margins has raised fundamental questions about the onset of ocean-floor type magmatism, and has guided interpretation of seismic data across many rifted margins, including the highly extended northern South China Sea margin. Here we report International Ocean Discovery Program drilling data from the northern South China Sea margin, testing the magma-poor margin model outside the North Atlantic. Contrary to \u2026",
                "Post-rift fault activities were often observed in deepwater basins, which have great contributions to oil and gas migration and accumulation. The main causes for post-rift fault activities include tectonic events, mud or salt diapirs, and gravitational collapse. In the South China Sea continental margin, post-rift fault activities are widely distributed, especially in Baiyun sag, one of the largest deepwater sag with its main body located beneath present continental slope. During the post-rift stage, large population of faults kept active for a long time from 32 Ma (T70) till 5.5 Ma (T10). Seismic interpretation, fault analysis and analogue modeling experiments indicate that the post-rift fault activities in Baiyun sag between 32 Ma (T70) and 13.8 Ma (T30) was mainly controlled by gravity pointing to the Main Baiyun sag, which caused the faults extensive on the side facing Main Baiyun sag and the back side compressive.

                "The start of the Mesozoic Era is marked by roughly 5 m.y. of Earth system upheavals, including unstable biotic recovery, repeated global warming, ocean anoxia, and perturbations in the global carbon cycle. Intervals between crises were comparably hospitable to life. The causes of these upheavals are unknown, but are thought to be linked to recurrent Siberian volcanism. Here, two marine sedimentary successions at Chaohu and Daxiakou (South China) are evaluated for paleoclimate change from astronomical forcing. In these sections, gamma-ray variations indicative of terrestrial weathering reveal enhanced obliquity cycling over prolonged intervals, characterized by a 32.8 k.y. periodicity with strong 1.2 m.y. modulations. These suggest a 22 h length of day and 1.2 m.y. interaction between the orbital inclinations of Earth and Mars. Comparing the 1.2 m.y. obliquity modulation cycles in these sections with \u2026",
                "The high density (2 km \u00d7 6 km), high resolution (19 sequence boundaries) seismic reflection profiles and 42 industrial wells (including VSP data, gamma ray, sonic and density logs) are now available in Qiongdongnan Basin to the northwest of South China Sea. Then we explored the time\u2013depth relationships of strata, obtained the compaction curves of shale and sand, and recovered the original sediment thickness. Furthermore, we calculated the sediment budget and analyzed the deepwater sedimentation processes.The thickest sediment of Qiongdongnan Basin is more than 16 km. The temporal\u2013spatial distribution of sedimentation is characterized by three stages i.e. syn-rift stage (45\u201321 Ma), early post-rift stage (21\u201310.5 Ma) and late post-rift stage (10.5\u20130 Ma). The distribution of sedimentation in deepwater is mainly controlled by the sediment source and transportation routes. The NE trended, S-shaped central \u2026",
                "Thick successions from the margins of the Triassic Yangtze Platform of the South China Block record a transition from carbonate-rich facies (Zhuganpo Formation and equivalents) to clastic-rich facies (Xiaowa Formation and equivalents) during the Carnian (early Late Triassic) that mark the final phase of termination of this long-lived platform. Cyclostratigraphy derived from spectral gamma-ray (SGR) intensity curves was combined with magnetostratigraphy of two sections in Guizhou Province (Wayao transect and its upward extension into the Geopark Wayao in Guanling county and the Laishike section in Zhenfeng county) and one location in Sichuan Province (Hanwang section). The cyclostratigraphy from all the Guizhou sections indicates a persistent suite of ca. 34 m, 9 m and 1.8 m cycles, which are consistent with the ratios of orbital-climate oscillations caused by long-eccentricity (405 kyr), short-eccentricity \u2026",

                "The time scale of the Late Triassic Epoch has a divergence of age models, especially for the durations of competing definitions for its Rhaetian Stage (uppermost Triassic). The astrochronology derived from relative depth of lacustrine-bearing clastic successions and astronomically tuned geomagnetic polarity time scale (APTS) of the Newark Supergroup of eastern North America provides a basis for the Late Triassic time scale. However, the Newark APTS has been challenged regarding its age scale and completeness; therefore an independent astronomical-tuned magnetic polarity zonation is required to verify the upper Newark APTS reference scale. We compiled a 6.5 million year (myr) APTS with magnetic stratigraphy from four sections of the lacustrine-fluvial, dinosaur-track-bearing Xujiahe Formation in the Sichuan Basin of South China that also has dating from detrital zircons and regional biostratigraphy \u2026",
                "Multiple proxies for paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental change within sedimentary sequences have been developed; but understanding their relationships and their relative strengths or weaknesses are required to access a wealth of untapped paleoclimate information. We propose two main criteria for multiple proxy datasets to estimate their individual signal-to-noise levels and to decipher the relationship between multiple proxies. First, for proxies affected by similar processes, then their time-dependent changes should be similar. Second, a paleoclimate proxy that is more sensitive to an external forcing, such as astronomical forcing, is more useful than those that do not have such a response. We introduce two methods to evaluate these criteria: (1) hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) probes the relationships among multiple proxies based on similarities of their oscillation patterns, and (2) power decomposition \u2026"
