                "This White Paper presents the science case of an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), focused on the structure and interactions of gluon-dominated matter, with the intent to articulate it to the broader nuclear science community. It was commissioned by the managements of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) with the objective of presenting a summary of scientific opportunities and goals of the EIC as a follow-up to the 2007 NSAC Long Range plan. This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics over the past decades and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on \u201cGluons and quark sea at high energies\u201d at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required \u2026",
                "We study the cross section for one-particle inclusive deep inelastic scattering off the nucleon for low transverse momentum of the detected hadron. We decompose the cross section in terms of structure functions and calculate them at tree level in terms of transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions. Our results are complete in the one-photon exchange approximation at leading and first subleading twist accuracy, with both beam and target polarization.",
                "Universality in QCD factorization of parton densities, fragmentation functions, and soft factors is endangered by the process dependence of the directions of Wilson lines in their definitions. We find a choice of directions that is consistent with factorization and that gives universality between e+ e\u2212 annihilation, semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, and the Drell-Yan process. Universality is only modified by a time-reversal transformation of the soft function and parton densities between Drell-Yan and the other processes, whose only effect is the known reversal of sign for T-odd parton densities such as the Sivers function. The modifications of the definitions needed to remove rapidity divergences with lightlike Wilson lines do not affect the results.",
                "Recent work suggests nontrivial relations between generalized parton distributions on the one hand and (naive time-reversal odd) transverse momentum dependent distributions on the other. Here we review the present knowledge on such type of relations. Moreover, as far as spectator model calculations are concerned, the existing results are considerably extended. While various relations between the two types of parton distributions can be found in the framework of spectator models, so far no nontrivial model-independent relations have been established.",
                "The fully unintegrated, off-diagonal quark-quark correlator for a spin-1\/2 hadron is parameterized in terms of so-called generalized parton correlation functions. Such objects, in particular, can be considered as mother distributions of generalized parton distributions on the one hand and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions on the other. Therefore, our study provides new, model-independent insights into the recently proposed nontrivial relations between generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. We find that none of these relations can be promoted to a model-independent status. As a by-product we obtain the first complete classification of generalized parton distributions beyond leading twist. The present paper is a natural extension of our previous corresponding analysis for spin-0 hadrons.",
                "The Sivers function is extracted from HERMES data on single spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering. Our analysis use a simple Gaussian model for the distribution of transverse parton momenta, together with the flavor dependence given by the leading 1\/N c approximation and a neglect of the Sivers antiquark distribution. We find that within the errors of the data these approximations are sufficient.",
                "In this paper we present a comprehensive formalism for dilepton production from the collision of two polarized spin-1 2 hadrons by identifying the general angular distribution of the cross section in combination with a complete set of structure functions. The various structure functions are computed in the parton model approximation where we mainly consider the case when the transverse momentum of the dilepton pair is much smaller than its invariant mass. In this kinematical region dilepton production can be described in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions.",
                "The general parameterization of the quark\u2013quark correlation function for a spin-1 2 hadron is considered. The presence of the Wilson line ensuring color gauge invariance of the correlator induces structures that were not given explicitly in the existing literature. In particular, the general form of the transverse momentum dependent correlator entering various hard scattering processes is derived. In this case two new time-reversal odd parton distributions appear at the twist-3 level.",
                "The Sivers parton distribution function has been predicted to obey a particular \u201cuniversality relation\u201d, namely, to have opposite sign in semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and the Drell\u2013Yan process. We discuss how, on the basis of present HERMES data, this remarkable prediction of the QCD factorization approach to the description of single spin asymmetries related to the Sivers effect could be checked experimentally in future experiments at PAX and COMPASS.",
                "This report is based on a ten-week program on\" Gluons and the quark sea at high-energies\", which took place at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Seattle in Fall 2010. The principal aim of the program was to develop and sharpen the science case for an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), a facility that will be able to collide electrons and positrons with polarized protons and with light to heavy nuclei at high energies, offering unprecedented possibilities for in-depth studies of quantum chromodynamics. This report is organized around four major themes: i) the spin and flavor structure of the proton, ii) three-dimensional structure of nucleons and nuclei in momentum and configuration space, iii) QCD matter in nuclei, and iv) Electroweak physics and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. Beginning with an executive summary, the report contains tables of key measurements, chapter overviews for each of the major scientific themes, and detailed individual contributions on various aspects of the scientific opportunities presented by an EIC."
