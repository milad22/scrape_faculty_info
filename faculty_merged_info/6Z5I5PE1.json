                "Rheology, morphology and mechanical properties of binary PE and EVA blends together with their thermal behavior were studied. The results of rheological studies showed that, for given PE and EVA, the interfacial interaction in PE-rich blends is higher than EVA-rich blends, which in turn led to finer and well-distributed morphology in PE-rich blends. Using two different models, the phase inversion composition was predicted to be in 45 and 47 wt% of the PE phase. This was justified by morphological studies, where a clear co-continuous morphology for 50\/50 blend was observed. The tensile strength for PE-rich blends showed positive deviation from mixing rule, whereas the 50\/50 blend and EVA-rich blends displayed negative deviation. These results were in a good agreement with the results of viscoelastic behavior of the blends. The elongation at break was found to follow the same trend as tensile strength \u2026",
                "Polyurethane (PU) has been commonly used in a wide range of applications due to its high flexibility and good UV resistance. Attempts have been extensively carried out to improve the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of this coating through inclusion of nanomaterials. In this study the graphene oxide nanosheets, covalently functionalized by (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane, were introduced into the PU matrix to enhance the mentioned weaknesses. The modified (fGO) and unmodified-graphene oxide nanosheets (GO) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV\u2013vis and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The physical\u2013mechanical properties of the PU coatings reinforced with GO and fGO nanosheets were characterized by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and \u2026",
                "In this work: (i) magnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4 are synthesized via precipitation method, functionalized with \u03b2-cyclodextrin hydroxyl-rich precursor, and characterized by FTIR, TEM and magnetic hysteresis loop techniques; (ii) epoxy nanocomposites containing bare and \u03b2-cyclodextrin-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles are prepared, and their cure behavior\/kinetics has been studied by isoconversional models applied on dynamic DSC data; (iii) adhesion energy between cure moieties and surface of \u03b2-cyclodextrin is quantified using molecular dynamics simulation. Activation energy of epoxy resin increased from 56 to 62 kJ\/mol upon introduction of \u03b2-cyclodextrin-modified Fe3O4 to the epoxy, which suggests retarded crosslinking compared to the blank system, while a highly cured network was identified for the resin containing \u03b2-cyclodextrin-modified Fe3O4 particles due to additional chemical reaction of hydroxyl \u2026",
                "Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized and modified with chitosan as a natural surface modifier to prevent their aggregation and make them potent to contribute to ring opening of epoxy. Functionalized Fe3O4 (Chitosan@Fe3O4) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscope and magnetic hysteresis loops measurements. The cure behavior and kinetics of epoxy nanocomposites filled with bare and chitosan-modified Fe3O4 were analyzed using isothermal and nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The kinetic models applied to DSC experimental data suggested positive effect of Chitosan@Fe3O4 MNPs on cure reaction between epoxy and polyamidoamine hardener. Experimental and modeling outcomes from epoxy\/Chitosan@Fe3O4 nanocomposites were supported by theoretical quantum chemical calculations \u2026",
                "In the present study, the effect of different types of iron oxides, which naturally exist on steel substrate, on the interfacial interaction between an epoxy coating and a carbon steel substrate was studied at the molecular\/atomic level by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. Three types of iron oxide, that is, ferrous oxide (FeO), ferric oxide (Fe2O3, hematite), and ferrous ferric oxide (Fe3O4, magnetite), were considered for modeling, and their binding energies were calculated and compared by altering the concentration of hydroxide groups on the surface. To probe the effect of curing agent on interfacial interactions, computations were performed for either uncured or aminoamide-cured epoxy resins. The effect of the acid\u2013base properties of the iron oxide on the molecular bonding was theoretically investigated by imposing diverse iron hydroxide\/oxide termination \u2026",
                "The mission of an advanced epoxy-based nanocomposite coating is to provide a given substrate with protection against an unwelcome guest; e.g. corrosive molecules\/media, environmental stress, flame, thermal degradation or microorganisms. In such systems, the degree to which superior properties can be guaranteed depends on the state of network formation in the epoxy in the presence of nanoparticles. For low-filled epoxy nanocomposite coatings, barrierity was taken as the main mechanism controlling over the efficiency of corrosion inhibition in the coating against oxygen or other corrosive moieties, whilst in highly-loaded nanocomposites one should take a closer look at both physical and chemical interaction between the resin and nanoparticles. In this sense, epoxy\/Fe3O4 systems were studied here as model nanocomposite coatings and their anti-corrosion and flame retardancy potentials were patterned \u2026",
                "The effect of cerium oxide treatment on the corrosion protection properties and interfacial interaction of steel\/epoxy was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, (EIS) classical molecular dynamics (MD) and first principle quantum mechanics (QM) simulation methods X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to verify the chemical composition of the Ce film deposited on the steel. To probe the role of the curing agent in epoxy adsorption, computations were compared for an epoxy, aminoamide and aminoamide modified epoxy. Moreover, to study the influence of water on interfacial interactions the MD simulations were executed for poly (aminoamide)-cured epoxy resin in contact with the different crystallographic cerium dioxide (ceria, CeO2) surfaces including (100), (110), and (111) in the presence of water molecules. It was found that aminoamide-cured epoxy material was strongly adhered to \u2026",
                "Nonisothermal calorimetric and isothermal rheokinetic analyses were used to study cure kinetics of epoxy\/anhydride systems containing very low concentration of pristine and amine\u2010functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Isoconversional methods were applied in calorimetric modeling of cure kinetics. E\u03b1 vs. \u03b1 dependency and autocatalytic nature of curing were identified for both types of nanocomposites by isoconversional models. Fall in E\u03b1 value from 90 to 82.5 kJ mol\u22121 thanks to amine functionalization (with E\u03b1 of blank epoxy\/anhydride of 80.3 kJ mol\u22121) was indicative of high potential of nanocomposites to cure at low concentration of functionalized MWCNTs (0.1 g with respect to 100 g of resin). Times of gelation and vitrification of epoxy were measured using storage and loss modulus data provided by isothermal rheokinetic analysis, showing a drop upon attachment of amine groups to \u2026",
                "Biowaste chicken eggshell (ES) powder was applied as a potential cure modifier in epoxy\/anhydride systems. Cure behaviour and kinetics of composites filled with very low content (0.1 wt% based on epoxy resin) of ES, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and terpolymer-modified fillers, mES and mCaCO3, were discussed comparatively. Surface analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cure kinetics was investigated by differential (Friedman) and integral (Ozawa and Kissinger\u2013Akahira\u2013Sunose) isoconversional methods using dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. Overall, protein precursors naturally existing in the structure of pristine ES facilitated crosslinking of epoxy and hardener of anhydride with functional groups resulting from terpolymer attachment to CaCO3 particles. Accelerated\/hindered cure was observed depending on the filler type and surface characteristics, as \u2026",
                "The isothermal curing kinetics of epoxy\/nano-glassflake (NGF) was studied using isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The results of the isoconversional method show that the effect of conversion on activation energy (Ea) is negligible for both the neat resin and NGF-filled system. Model-fitting methods were used to determine the kinetic triplet, i.e., pre-exponential factor [A], activation energy [Ea], and reaction order [n], by a simultaneous treatment of all isothermal curing experimental data. The kinetic triplet showed reduction in presence of NGF. A good agreement between experimental data and nth-order model is found for all curing temperatures. Although both methods show that the Ea of epoxy\/NGF are lower than those of the systems without NGF, the reaction is slower in the presence of NGF. Additional investigations on the glass transition temperature and curing kinetic curves show that \u2026"
