                "With about two-thirds of all used energy being lost as waste heat, there is a compelling need for high-performance thermoelectric materials that can directly and reversibly convert heat to electrical energy. However, the practical realization of thermoelectric materials is limited by their hitherto low figure of merit, ZT, which governs the Carnot efficiency according to the second law of thermodynamics. The recent successful strategy of nanostructuring to reduce thermal conductivity has achieved record-high ZT values in the range 1.5\u20131.8 at 750\u2013900 kelvin 1, 2, 3, but still falls short of the generally desired threshold value of 2. Nanostructures in bulk thermoelectrics allow effective phonon scattering of a significant portion of the phonon spectrum, but phonons with long mean free paths remain largely unaffected. Here we show that heat-carrying phonons with long mean free paths can be scattered by controlling and fine \u2026",
                "Lead-free solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices based on methylammonium tin iodide (CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3) perovskite semiconductor as the light harvester are reported. Featuring an optical bandgap of 1.3 eV, the CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3 perovskite material can be incorporated into devices with the organic hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD and show an absorption onset at 950 nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with the benchmark CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 counterpart (1.55 eV). Bandgap engineering was implemented by chemical substitution in the form of CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3\u2013x Br x solid solutions, which can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free solar cells with an initial power conversion efficiency of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight. Further efficiency enhancements are expected following optimization and a better fundamental understanding \u2026",
                "We report the first observation of random laser action with coherent feedback in semiconductor powder. Since the scattering mean free path is less than the emission wavelength, recurrent light scattering arises and provides coherent feedback for lasing. Discrete lasing modes have been observed above the threshold. The dependence of the lasing threshold intensity on the excitation volume agrees with the random laser theory. Laser emission from the powder could be observed in all directions. This observation also provides direct evidence for the existence of recurrent scattering of light.",
                "Dye-sensitized solar cells based on titanium dioxide (TiO 2) are promising low-cost alternatives to conventional solid-state photovoltaic devices based on materials such as Si, CdTe and CuIn 1\u2212 x Ga x Se 2 (refs 1, 2). Despite offering relatively high conversion efficiencies for solar energy, typical dye-sensitized solar cells suffer from durability problems that result from their use of organic liquid electrolytes containing the iodide\/tri-iodide redox couple, which causes serious problems such as electrode corrosion and electrolyte leakage 3. Replacements for iodine-based liquid electrolytes have been extensively studied, but the efficiencies of the resulting devices remain low 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Here we show that the solution-processable p-type direct bandgap semiconductor CsSnI 3 can be used for hole conduction in lieu of a liquid electrolyte. The resulting solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells consist of CsSnI 2.95 F 0.05 \u2026",
                "To minimize interfacial power losses, thin (5\u201380 nm) layers of NiO, a p-type oxide semiconductor, are inserted between the active organic layer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) + [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and the ITO (tin-doped indium oxide) anode of bulk-heterojunction ITO\/P3HT:PCBM\/LiF\/Al solar cells. The interfacial NiO layer is deposited by pulsed laser deposition directly onto cleaned ITO, and the active layer is subsequently deposited by spin-coating. Insertion of the NiO layer affords cell power conversion efficiencies as high as 5.2% and enhances the fill factor to 69% and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to 638 mV versus an ITO\/P3HT:PCBM\/LiF\/Al control device. The value of such hole-transporting\/electron-blocking interfacial layers is clearly demonstrated and should be applicable to other organic photovoltaics.",
                "Perovskite-based solar cells have recently been catapulted to the cutting edge of thin-film photovoltaic research and development because of their promise for high-power conversion efficiencies and ease of fabrication. Two types of generic perovskites compounds have been used in cell fabrication: either Pb- or Sn-based. Here, we describe the performance of perovskite solar cells based on alloyed perovskite solid solutions of methylammonium tin iodide and its lead analogue (CH3NH3Sn1\u2013xPbxI3). We exploit the fact that, the energy band gaps of the mixed Pb\/Sn compounds do not follow a linear trend (the Vegard\u2019s law) in between these two extremes of 1.55 and 1.35 eV, respectively, but have narrower bandgap (<1.3 eV), thus extending the light absorption into the near-infrared (\u223c1,050 nm).

                "A matrix addressable diode flat panel display has been fabricated using a carbon nanotube\u2013epoxy composite as the electron emission source. Field-emission uniformity has been confirmed by measuring the I\u2013V curves of pixels across the panel. This prototype display demonstrates well-lit pixels under \u00b1150\u2009V biasing signals. The \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d of the pixels are well controlled by the half voltage \u201coff-pixel\u201d method. Further improvement of this technology may lead to easy-to-make and inexpensive flat panel displays.",
                "Recent advances in polymer solar cell (PSC) performance have resulted from compressing the bandgap to enhance the short-circuit current while lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital to increase the open-circuit voltage. Nevertheless, PSC power conversion efficiencies are still constrained by low fill factors, typically below 70%. Here, we report PSCs with exceptionally high fill factors by combining complementary materials design, synthesis, processing and device engineering strategies. The donor polymers, PTPD3T and PBTI3T, when incorporated into inverted bulk-heterojunction PSCs with a PC 71 BM acceptor, result in PSCs with fill factors of 76\u201380%. The enhanced performance is attributed to highly ordered, closely packed and properly oriented active-layer microstructures with optimal horizontal phase separation and vertical phase gradation. The result is efficient charge extraction and suppressed \u2026",
                "We have observed spatial confinement of laser light in micrometer-sized random media. The optical confinement is attributed to the disorder-induced scattering and interference. Our experimental data suggest that coherent amplification of the scattered light enhances the interference effect and helps the spatial confinement. Using the finite-difference time-domain method, we simulate lasing with coherent feedback in the active random medium.",
                "Uniformly distributed ZnO nanorods have been grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using a two-step process. By controlling the oxygen content in the gas mixture during the nucleation and growth steps, no catalyst is required for the formation of ZnO nanorods. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies show that ZnO nanorods are single crystals and that they grow along the c axis of the crystal plane. Alignment of these nanorods with respect to the substrates depends on the lattice mismatch between ZnO and the substrate, the surface electric field, and the amount of defects in the starting nuclei. Room-temperature photoluminescence measurements of these ZnO nanorods have shown ultraviolet peaks at 380 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 106 meV, which are comparable to those found in high-quality ZnO films. Photoluminescence measurements of annealed ZnO \u2026"
