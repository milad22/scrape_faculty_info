In recent developments, his research group has discovered how to engineer new thermodynamic phases of superfluid 3 He in the confines of highly porous silica aereogel, thus bringing together the practical aspects of fluid confinement in porous media and the basic science of superfluidity. Much of this research involves close cooperation and collaboration with Professor Sauls' theoretical group at Northwestern. Halperin has been developing 17 O NMR as a probe of the magnetic fluctuations associated with magnetic vortices in novel high-T c superconductors. His research group was the first to take these methods to extremely high magnetic fields, above 40 Tesla, using special facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. Halperin uses acoustic cavity techniques to investigate collective excitations of the 3 He superfluid order parameter and he is investigating gapless superfluidity using high-resolution heat capacity methods applied at very low temperatures. The work on high temperature superconductors and heavy-fermion superconductivity uses NMR, neutron scattering, specific heat and magnetization. Together with colleagues at the University of Illinois Urbana, Stanford and the University of Notre Dame they have shown that the compound UPt 3 is a three dimensional topological superconductor. The crystals are grown in Halperin's crystal growth facility and are of the highest quality ever produced. Honors and Awards Alfred P.
