BenZvi Associate Professor of Physics PhD 405\u00a0Bausch & Lomb (585) 276-7172 Fax: (585) 273-3237 sybenzvi@pas.rochester.edu Curriculum Vitae Research Overview I am an experimental physicist specializing in astroparticle physics, which is the study of cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos from extraterrestrial sources. My focus is the study of charged cosmic rays and gamma rays above 1 TeV, an energy range that allows us to indirectly observe high-energy particle acceleration in supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and gamma-ray bursts. At these energies, observations of TeV gamma rays are also very important for cosmology, because the gamma rays with interact with primordial radiation fields (the cosmic infrared background) that are very difficult to observe directly. In addition, TeV gamma rays can be used as possible tracers of dark matter annihilation. I currently participate in the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Gamma-Ray Observatory (or HAWC) in central Mexico and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole.
