                "Matteo Broccio Lecturer II 217 Allen Hall (412) 624-2755 mbroccio@pitt.edu My main focuses are: a)\u00a0 transforming the instruction in introductory courses for life science majors, by blending flipped-classroom and cooperative learning methods; b) develop physiologically relevant content, which is tailored around students in the pre-med and pre-health-professions track; c) helping students to develop effective self-assessment strategies. My key responsibility is the instruction in large-enrollment introductory physics courses for undergraduate students majoring in engineering, natural sciences, life sciences, and premed. I routinely teach introductory courses in the department including: Phys. 0110, 0111, 0174, 0175, 0410, and 0411. (412) 624-2755"
