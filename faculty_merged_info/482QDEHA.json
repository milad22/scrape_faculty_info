                "The advent of spin transfer torque effect accommodates site-specific switching of magnetic nanostructures by current alone without magnetic field. However, the critical current density required for usual spin torque switching remains stubbornly high around 10 6\u201310 7 A cm\u2212 2. It would be fundamentally transformative if an electric field through a voltage could assist or accomplish the switching of ferromagnets. Here we report electric-field-assisted reversible switching in CoFeB\/MgO\/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions with interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, where the coercivity, the magnetic configuration and the tunnelling magnetoresistance can be manipulated by voltage pulses associated with much smaller current densities. These results represent a crucial step towards ultralow energy switching in magnetic tunnel junctions, and open a new avenue for exploring other voltage-controlled spintronic devices.",
                "Platinum (Pt) metal, being nonmagnetic and with a strong spin-orbit coupling interaction, has been central in detecting the pure spin current and establishing most of the recent spin-based phenomena. Magnetotransport measurements, both electrical and thermal, conclusively show strong ferromagnetic characteristics in thin Pt films on the ferromagnetic insulator due to the magnetic proximity effects. The pure spin current phenomena measured by Pt, including the inverse spin Hall and the spin Seebeck effects, are thus contaminated and not exclusively established.",
                "Most studies of spin caloritronic effects to date, including spin-Seebeck effect, utilize thin films on substrates. We use patterned ferromagnetic thin film to demonstrate the profound effect of a substrate on the spin-dependent thermal transport. With different sample patterns and on varying the direction of temperature gradient, both longitudinal and transverse thermal voltages exhibit asymmetric instead of symmetric spin dependence. This unexpected behavior is due to an out-of-plane temperature gradient imposed by the thermal conduction through the substrate and the mixture of anomalous Nernst effects. Only with substrate-free samples have we determined the intrinsic spin-dependent thermal transport with characteristics and field sensitivity similar to those of the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect.",
                "We demonstrate that magnetic properties of ultrathin Co films adjacent to Gd 2 O 3 gate oxides can be directly manipulated by voltage. The Co films can be reversibly changed from an optimally oxidized state with a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to a metallic state with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy or to an oxidized state with nearly zero magnetization, depending on the polarity and time duration of the applied electric fields. Consequently, an unprecedentedly large change of magnetic anisotropy energy up to 0.73 erg\/cm 2 has been realized in a nonvolatile manner using gate voltages of only a few volts. These results open a new route to achieve ultralow energy magnetization manipulation in spintronic devices.",
                "Room temperature ferromagnetism in polycrystalline Co x Ce 1\u2212 x O 2\u2212 \u03b4 (0.001\u2264 x\u2264 0.10) bulk samples has been investigated. Annealing in the forming gas transformed the as-prepared paramagnetic into a ferromagnetic insulating material with over two orders of magnitude enhancement (from 3.7\u00d7 10\u2212 2 to 1.24 \u03bc B\/Co) in the magnetization. Structural characterization of both the as-prepared and H 2-treated samples showed a single phase material. The incorporation of Co with the formation of oxygen vacancies in the oxide lattice was revealed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The presence of oxygen vacancies is indicated by the existence of mixed valence states of cerium (Ce 4+ and Ce 3+) in the high resolution XPS 3d spectrum. The role of the donor defects (oxygen vacancies) has been verified through the removal of oxygen vacancies. The ferromagnetic insulating ground state has been \u2026",
                "Structural, magnetic, and transport studies have been performed on perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJ) with Mo as the buffer and capping layers. After annealing samples at 300\u2009\u00b0C and higher, consistently better performance was obtained compared to that of conventional pMTJs with Ta layers. Large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) values were retained in a wide range of samples with Mo layers after annealing for 2 h at 400\u2009\u00b0C, in sharp contrast to the junctions with Ta layers, in which superparamagnetic behavior with nearly vanishing magnetoresistance was observed. As a result of the greatly improved thermal stability, TMR as high as 162% was obtained in junctions containing Mo layers. These results highlight the importance of the heavy-metal layers adjacent to CoFeB electrodes for achieving larger TMR, stronger PMA, and higher thermal \u2026",
                "Spintronic devices can be operated by either a magnetic field or a spin polarized current; however, the former is not site-specific, and the latter suffers from large current density issues. In this work, we show that voltage-controlled spintronic devices offer many attributes. Although a metallic ferromagnet responds only very weakly to an electric field if at all, under special circumstances an electric field can have a profound impact on its magnetic properties. An electric field can alter the interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of CoFeB\/MgO\/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in a prescribed manner. By exploiting the voltage dependence of the PMA we have accomplished voltage-controlled MTJ for which the high-and low-resistance states can be accessed reversibly and repeatedly by voltage pulses associated with very low current density in the range of 10 4 A cm\u2212 2. This development opens up a \u2026",
                "A novel bio\u2010magnetomechanical microtissue system is described for magnetic actuation of arrays of 3D microtissues using microcantilevers. This system enables both in situ measurements of fundamental mechanical properties of engineered tissue, such as contractility and stiffness, as well as dynamic stimulation of the microtissues. Using this system, cell and extracellular matrix contributions to the tissue mechanical properties are decoupled for the first time under both static and dynamic loading conditions.",
                "The tunneling magnetoresistance and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in CoFeB(1.1-1.2 nm)\/MgO\/CoFeB(1.2-1.7 nm) junctions were found to be very sensitively dependent on annealing time. During annealing at a given temperature, decay of magnetoresistance occurs much earlier compared to junctions with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Through a rapid thermal annealing study, the decrease of magnetoresistance is found to be associated with the degradation of perpendicular anisotropy, instead of impurity diffusion as observed in common in-plane junctions. The origin of the evolution of perpendicular anisotropy as well as possible means to further enhance tunneling magnetoresistance is discussed.",
                "We have prepared Co-doped ZnO bulks with a two-step method. The bulk samples are sintered at the temperature above 1000\u00b0C to get pure single phase and then treated by Zn vapor in a vacuum. Based on such two-step preparation, clear carrier induced ferromagnetism is found in Zn treated Co-doped ZnO bulks, which suggests that the magnetism mechanism can be of codoping effect. The onset of ferromagnetism is associated with the further increase of the hybridization of the impurity band with 3d states near the Fermi level when additional carrier induced to let the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism to be satisfied."
