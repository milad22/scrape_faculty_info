                "The LHC has observed, so far, 3 deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions in flavor observables: LHCb reported anomalies in B\u2192 K* \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and R (K)= B\u2192 K \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\/B\u2192 K e+ e\u2212, while CMS found an excess in h\u2192 \u03bc \u03c4. We show, for the first time, how these deviations from the SM can be explained within a single well-motivated model: a two-Higgs-doublet model with gauged L \u03bc\u2212 L \u03c4 symmetry. We find that, despite the constraints from \u03c4\u2192 \u03bc \u03bc \u03bc and B s\u2212 Bs mixing, one can explain h\u2192 \u03bc \u03c4, B\u2192 K* \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and R (K) simultaneously, obtaining interesting correlations among the observables.",
                "We present a comprehensive review of keV-scale sterile neutrino Dark Matter, collecting views and insights from all disciplines involved\u2014cosmology, astrophysics, nuclear, and particle physics\u2014in each case viewed from both theoretical and experimental\/observational perspectives. After reviewing the role of active neutrinos in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, we focus on sterile neutrinos in the context of the Dark Matter puzzle. Here, we first review the physics motivation for sterile neutrino Dark Matter, based on challenges and tensions in purely cold Dark Matter scenarios. We then round out the discussion by critically summarizing all known constraints on sterile neutrino Dark Matter arising from astrophysical observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical considerations. In this context, we provide a balanced discourse on the possibly positive signal from X-ray observations. Another focus of \u2026",
                "We study the impact of an additional U (1)\u2032 gauge symmetry with flavor-dependent charges for quarks and leptons on the LHC flavor anomalies observed in B\u2192 K* \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212, R (K)= B\u2192 K \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\/B\u2192 K e+ e\u2212, and h\u2192 \u03bc \u03c4. In its minimal version with two scalar doublets, the resulting model naturally explains the deviations from the Standard Model observed in B\u2192 K* \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and R (K). The CMS access in h\u2192 \u03bc \u03c4 can be explained by introducing a third scalar doublet, which gives rise to a prediction for \u03c4\u2192 3 \u03bc. We investigate constraints from flavor observables and direct LHC searches for p p\u2192 Z\u2032\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212. Our model successfully generates the measured fermion-mixing matrices and does not require vectorlike fermions, unlike previous attempts to explain these anomalies.",
                "BABAR, Belle, and LHCb Collaborations report evidence for new physics in B\u2192 D \u03c4 \u03bd and B\u2192 D* \u03c4 \u03bd of approximately 3.8 \u03c3. There is also the long lasting discrepancy of about 3 \u03c3 in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the branching ratio for \u03c4\u2192 \u03bc \u03bd \u03bd is 1.8 \u03c3 (2.4 \u03c3) above the standard model expectation using the HFAG (PDG) values. Furthermore, CMS Collaboration finds hints for a nonzero decay rate of h\u2192 \u03bc \u03c4. Interestingly, all these observations can be explained by introducing new scalars. In this Letter we consider these processes within a lepton-specific two-Higgs doublet model (ie, of type X) with additional nonstandard Yukawa couplings. It is found that one can accommodate \u03c4\u2192 \u03bc \u03bd \u03bd with modified Higgs\u2013\u03c4 couplings. The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be explained if the additional neutral C P-even Higgs boson H is light (below 100 GeV). Also R (D) and R (D*) can be easily \u2026",
                "The extension of the standard model by a spontaneously broken abelian gauge group based on the L \u03bc\u2212 L \u03c4 lepton number can resolve the long-standing discrepancy between experimental and theoretical values for the magnetic moment of the muon. It furthermore naturally generates \u03bc\u2212 \u03c4 symmetric lepton mixing, introduces neutrino nonstandard interactions, and the associated gauge boson Z\u2032 serves as a mediator to the right-handed neutrino sector. A detailed fit to electroweak data is performed to identify the allowed values for the mass of Z\u2032 and its mixing with the standard model Z. An economical new scalar sector is constructed that spontaneously breaks L \u03bc\u2212 L \u03c4 and leads to experimental consequences such as lepton flavor violation and collider signatures. Furthermore we discuss the nonabelian extension to an S U (2)\u2032, particularly the neutrino sector.",
                "We study lepton flavor violating Higgs decays in two models, with the recently found hint for Higgs\u2192 \u03bc \u03c4 at CMS as a benchmark value for the branching ratio. The first model uses the discrete flavor symmetry group A 4, broken at the electroweak scale, while the second is renormalizable and based on the Abelian gauge group L \u03bc\u2212 L \u03c4. Within the models we find characteristic predictions for other non-standard Higgs decay modes, charged lepton flavor violating decays and correlations of the branching ratios with neutrino oscillation parameters.",
                "The difference between baryon number B and lepton number L is the only anomaly-free global symmetry of the Standard Model, easily promoted to a local symmetry by introducing three right-handed neutrinos, which automatically make neutrinos massive. The non-observation of any (B\u2013L)-violating processes leads us to scrutinize the case of unbroken gauged B\u2013L; besides Dirac neutrinos, the model contains only three parameters, the gauge coupling strength g\u2032, the St\u00fcckelberg mass M Z\u2032, and the kinetic mixing angle \u03c7. The new force could manifest itself at any scale, and we collect and derive bounds on g\u2032 over the entire testable range M Z\u2032= 0\u201310 13 eV, also of interest for the more popular case of spontaneously broken B\u2013L or other new light forces. We show in particular that successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis provides strong bounds for masses 10 eV< M Z\u2032< 10 GeV due to resonant enhancement of \u2026",
                "Augmenting the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos allows for an anomaly-free gauge group extension G max= U (1) B\u2212 L\u00d7 U (1) Le\u2212 L\u03bc\u00d7 U (1) L\u03bc\u2212 L\u03c4. While simple U (1) subgroups of G max have already been discussed in the context of approximate flavor symmetries, we show how two-zero textures in the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass matrix can be enforced by the flavor symmetry, which is spontaneously broken very economically by singlet scalars. These zeros lead to two vanishing minors in the low-energy neutrino mass matrix after the seesaw mechanism. This study may provide a new testing ground for a zero-texture approach: the different classes of two-zero textures with almost identical neutrino oscillation phenomenology can in principle be distinguished by their different Z\u2032 interactions at colliders.",
                "We show that left-right symmetric models can easily accommodate stable TeV-scale dark matter particles without the need for an ad hoc stabilizing symmetry. The stability of a newly introduced multiplet either arises accidentally as in the minimal dark matter framework or comes courtesy of the remaining unbroken Z 2 subgroup of B\u2212 L. Only one new parameter is introduced: the mass of the new multiplet. As minimal examples, we study left-right fermion triplets and quintuplets and show that they can form viable two-component dark matter. This approach is, in particular, valid for S U (2)\u00d7 S U (2)\u00d7 U (1) models that explain the recent diboson excess at ATLAS in terms of a new charged gauge boson of mass 2 TeV.",
                "We construct UV-complete models for nonstandard neutrino interactions mediated by a sub-GeV gauge boson Z\u2032 coupled to baryon number B or B\u2212 L. A flavor-dependent Z\u2032 coupling to neutrinos is induced by mixing a U (1)\u2032-charged Dirac fermion with the active neutrinos, naturally suppressing flavor violation or nonuniversality of the charged leptons to the loop level. We show that these models can give rise to large flavor-conserving as well as flavor-violating nonstandard neutral-current neutrino interactions potentially observable in current or future oscillation experiments such as DUNE without being in conflict with other constraints such as neutrino scattering or lepton-flavor-violating decays. In particular, the LMA-Dark solution to the solar-neutrino anomaly can be obtained for U (1) B, but not for U (1) B\u2212 L."
