                "The relative organization of genes and repetitive DNAs in complex eukaryotic genomes is not well understood. Diagnostic sequencing indicated that a 280-kilobase region containing the maize Adh1-F and u22 genes is composed primarily of retrotransposons inserted within each other. Ten retroelement families were discovered, with reiteration frequencies ranging from 10 to 30,000 copies per haploid genome. These retrotransposons accounted for more than 60 percent of the Adh1-F region and at least 50 percent of the nuclear DNA of maize. These elements were largely intact and are dispersed throughout the gene-containing regions of the maize genome.",
                "The regenerative potential of skeletal muscle declines with age, and this impairment is associated with an increase in tissue fibrosis. We show that muscle stem cells (satellite cells) from aged mice tend to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as they begin to proliferate and that this conversion is mediated by factors in the systemic environment of the old animals. We also show that this lineage conversion is associated with an activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Furthermore, components of serum from aged mice that bind to the Frizzled family of proteins, which are Wnt receptors, may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells. These results indicate that the Wnt signaling pathway may play a critical role in tissue-specific stem cell aging and an increase in tissue fibrosis with age.",
                "Using the ImmunoChip custom genotyping array, we analyzed 14,498 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 24,091 healthy controls for 161,311 autosomal variants and identified 135 potentially associated regions (P< 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 4). In a replication phase, we combined these data with previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from an independent 14,802 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 26,703 healthy controls. In these 80,094 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 48 new susceptibility variants (P< 5.0\u00d7 10\u2212 8), 3 of which we found after conditioning on previously identified variants. Thus, there are now 110 established multiple sclerosis risk variants at 103 discrete loci outside of the major histocompatibility complex. With high-resolution Bayesian fine mapping, we identified five regions where one variant accounted for more than 50% of the posterior probability of association. This study \u2026",
                "The host restriction factor TRIM5\u03b1 mediates species-specific, early blocks to retrovirus infection; susceptibility to these blocks is determined by viral capsid sequences. Here we demonstrate that TRIM5\u03b1 variants from Old World monkeys specifically associate with the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) capsid and that this interaction depends on the TRIM5\u03b1 B30.2 domain. Human and New World monkey TRIM5\u03b1 proteins associated less efficiently with the HIV-1 capsid, accounting for the lack of restriction in cells of these species. After infection, the expression of a restricting TRIM5\u03b1 in the target cells correlated with a decrease in the amount of particulate capsid in the cytosol. In some cases, this loss of particulate capsid was accompanied by a detectable increase in soluble capsid protein. Inhibiting the proteasome did not abrogate restriction. Thus, TRIM5\u03b1 restricts retroviral infection by specifically recognizing the capsid and \u2026",
                "Purpose: The rationale for developing an alternative paclitaxel formulation concerns Cremophor EL-related side effects, and a novel paclitaxel delivery system might augment its therapeutic efficacy. Genexol-PM is a polymeric micelle formulated paclitaxel free of Cremophor EL. A phase I study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dosage, dose-limiting toxicities, and the pharmacokinetic profile of Genexol-PM in patients with advanced, refractory malignancies.Experimental Design: Twenty-one patients were entered into the study. Genexol-PM was i.v. administered over 3 h every 3 weeks without premedication. The Genexol-PM dose was escalated from 135 mg\/m2 to 390 mg\/m2.Results: All of the patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Acute hypersensitivity reactions were not observed. Neuropathy and myalgia were the most common toxicities. During cycle 1, grade 3 myalgia occurred in \u2026",
                "The cytoskeleton, integrin-mediated adhesion, and substrate stiffness control a common set of cell functions required for development and homeostasis that are often deranged in cancer. The connection between these mechanical elements and chemical signaling processes is not known. Here, we show that \u03b15\u03b21 integrin switches between relaxed and tensioned states in response to myosin II\u2013generated cytoskeletal force. Force combines with extracellular matrix stiffness to generate tension that triggers the integrin switch. This switch directly controls the \u03b15\u03b21-fibronectin bond strength through engaging the synergy site in fibronectin and is required to generate signals through phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. In the context of tissues, this integrin switch connects cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix mechanics to adhesion-dependent motility and signaling pathways.",
                "Whereas the adult gastrointestinal epithelium undergoes tremendous self-renewal through active proliferation in crypt stem cell compartments, the responsible growth factors regulating this continuous proliferation have not been defined. The exploration of physiologic functions of Wnt proteins in adult organisms has been hampered by functional redundancy and the necessity for conditional inactivation strategies. Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is a potent secreted Wnt antagonist that interacts with Wnt coreceptors of the LRP family. To address the contribution of Wnt signaling to gastrointestinal epithelial proliferation, adenoviral expression of Dkk1 was used to achieve stringent, conditional, and reversible Wnt inhibition in adult animals. Adenovirus Dkk1 (Ad Dkk1) treatment of adult mice repressed expression of the Wnt target genes CD44 and EphB2 within 2 days in both small intestine and colon, indicating an extremely broad \u2026",
                "Results from clinical trials have established sunitinib as a standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (RCC); however, many patients, particularly those with a poorer prognosis, do not meet inclusion criteria and little is known about the activity of sunitinib in these subgroups. The primary objective of this trial was to provide sunitinib on a compassionate-use basis to trial-ineligible patients with RCC from countries where regulatory approval had not been granted.Previously treated and treatment-naive patients at least 18 years of age with metastatic RCC were eligible. All patients received open-label sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily on schedule 4-2 (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off). Safety was assessed regularly, tumour measurements done per local practice, and survival data collected where possible. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to \u2026"
