                "The inclusive and dijet production cross-sections have been measured for jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) in proton\u2013proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 7\\mbox{~TeV}$, using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements use data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb\u22121. The b-jets are identified using either a lifetime-based method, where secondary decay vertices of b-hadrons in jets are reconstructed using information from the tracking detectors, or a muon-based method where the presence of a muon is used to identify semileptonic decays of b-hadrons inside jets. The inclusive b-jet cross-section is measured as a function of transverse momentum in the range 20<p T<400 GeV and rapidity in the range |y|<2.1. The -dijet cross-section is measured as a function of the dijet invariant mass in the range 110<m jj<760 GeV, the azimuthal angle \u2026",

Su orientaci\u00f3n se dirige a las aplicaciones y fue escrito tomando en cuenta las necesidades de los lectores que no cuentan con s\u00f3lidos conocimientos de matem\u00e1ticas; el requisito matem\u00e1tico para entenderlo es el conocimiento del \u00e1lgebra. Las aplicaciones del an\u00e1lisis de datos y la metodolog\u00eda estad\u00edstica son parte integral de la organizaci\u00f3n y presentaci\u00f3n del material del libro. El an\u00e1lisis y desarrollo de cada t\u00e9cnica se presentan en el escenario de una aplicaci\u00f3n, cuyos resultados estad\u00edsticos permiten comprender las decisiones y las soluciones de los problemas. Aunque el libro est\u00e1 orientado a las aplicaciones, se ha tenido cuidado de proporcionar un desarrollo metodol\u00f3gico s\u00f3lido y \u2026",
                "Surgery planning and scheduling systems play a critical role in the efficient matching of supply and demand for surgery. Competing performance measures and a number of complicating factors make surgery planning and scheduling challenging. Operating room (OR) managers must consider uncertainty in the duration of surgery and other critical activities, the arrival of unexpected urgent add\u2010on patients, and cancellations on the day of surgery while efficiently managing a variety of human and technical resources. Surgery schedules must be designed to balance competing performance criteria such as patient waiting time as well as idle time and overtime for both the OR team and other personnel. This article presents an introduction to surgery scheduling, a literature review, a small example, and a description of some of the important open challenges.",
                "This study is a replication and extension of a study by Castleberry (1990) in which 12 motivational factors related to a sales career were compared across generations. The importance of 12 key motivational factors related to sales positions were rank ordered by 1,390 college students. Respondents represented Gen-X college students from 1990 and Gen-Y students from 2006. The job itself and pay were consistently ranked first and second in both studies for \u201ctoday\u201d and \u201cten years in the future.\u201d Gen-Y students rated \u201chygiene\u201d factors related to job security as significantly more important than did Gen-X students. Conversely, Gen-X students rated \u201csatisfier\u201d factors as significantly more important than did Gen-Y students. Implications for sales managers, recruiters, and educators are provided based on the findings.",
                "It is common for a city to use expensive incentives such as a state-of-the-art stadium or tax exemptions to induce a major professional sport team to relocate to or remain in its area. A city does so because it expects a professional sport team to enhance the local economy. In this article, the authors use an event study approach to evaluate the advisability of this strategy. Their results suggest that major league sports franchises from the four major U.S. team sports (baseball, football, basketball, and hockey) have an adverse impact on local per capita income for U.S. markets in both the short and long run.",
                "Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique used to elicit partworth utilities for product attributes from consumers to aid in the evaluation of market potential for new products. The objective of the share-of-choice problem (a common approach to new product design) is to find the design that maximizes the number of respondents for whom the new product\u2019s utility exceeds a specific hurdle (reservation utility). We present an exact branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the share-of-choice problem. Our empirical results, based on several large commercial data sets and simulated data from a controlled experiment, suggest that the approach is useful for finding provably optimal solutions to realistically sized problems, including cases where partworths contain estimation error."
