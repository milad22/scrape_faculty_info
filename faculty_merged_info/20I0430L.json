                "Lethal disease due to hepatic periportal fibrosis occurs in 2%\u201310% of subjects infected by Schistosoma mansoni in endemic regions such as Sudan. It is unknown why few infected individuals present with severe disease, and inherited factors may play a role in fibrosis development. Schistosoma mansoni infection levels have been shown to be controlled by a locus that maps to chromosome 5q31-q33. To investigate the genetic control of severe hepatic fibrosis (assessed by ultrasound examination) causing portal hypertension, a segregation analysis was performed in 65 Sudanese pedigrees from the same village. Results provide evidence for a codominant major gene, with .16 as the estimated allele A frequency predisposing to advanced periportal fibrosis. For AA males, AA females, and Aa males a 50% penetrance is reached after, respectively, 9, 14, and 19 years of residency in the area, whereas for other \u2026",
                "Hepatic periportal fibrosis, which affects 5\u201310% of subjects infected by Schistosoma mansoni, is caused by the T cell-dependent granuloma that develop around schistosome eggs. Experimental models of infection have shown that granuloma and fibrosis are tightly regulated by cytokines. However, it is unknown why advanced periportal fibrosis occurs only in certain subjects. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the cytokine response of S. mansoni-infected subjects with advanced liver disease in an attempt to relate susceptibility to periportal fibrosis with an abnormal production of cytokines that regulate granuloma and fibrosis. Fibrosis was evaluated by ultrasound on 795 inhabitants of a Sudanese village in which S. mansoni is endemic: advanced periportal fibrosis was observed in 12% of the population; 35% of the affected subjects exhibited signs of portal hypertension.
