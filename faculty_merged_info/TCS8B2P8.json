                "Christopher M. Mauger Associate Professor (215) 746-1204 Experimental Particle Physics DRL 4N16 Homepage Professor Mauger was born in Philadelphia two blocks south of DRL at HUP and raised across the Delaware River in New Jersey.\u00a0 He enjoyed science classes at the Franklin Institute as a child - especially demonstrations involving liquid nitrogen.\u00a0 As a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar, he worked on several experiments in Kamioka and KEK including Super-Kamiokande, K2K and KamLAND where he began his work on neutrino interaction physics that is crucial for neutrino oscillation studies.\u00a0 As a staff member at Los Alamos National Laboratory, he was one of the founding members of LBNE which is now called DUNE.\u00a0 He also formed and led the CAPTAIN program. \u00a0 After moving to Penn in 2016, he continues these and other efforts associated with neutrino science.\u00a0 He also explores applied neutrino research with the WATCHMAN program. Professor Mauger conducts research in neutrino physics.\u00a0 He measures neutrino properties with neutrino oscillation experiments.\u00a0 His current efforts are determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and exploring leptonic CP violation.\u00a0 Extracting robust results from neutrino oscillation experiments requires a detailed understanding of the underlying interaction physics.\u00a0 As such, he explores each step of the process from fundamental interaction to the propagation of particles through the detector with his research program.\u00a0 He leads the CAPTAIN program and explores neutrino interactions with the Minerva Experiment.\u00a0 These efforts are in support of the long-baseline neutrino physics program in T2K and DUNE.\u00a0 He also explores applications of neutrinos - including to nuclear non-proliferation - and is generally interested in applying fundamental nuclear and particle physics techniques to broader sets of problems."
