                "We present the results for CAPRI Round 30, the first joint CASP\u2010CAPRI experiment, which brought together experts from the protein structure prediction and protein\u2013protein docking communities. The Round comprised 25 targets from amongst those submitted for the CASP11 prediction experiment of 2014. The targets included mostly homodimers, a few homotetramers, and two heterodimers, and comprised protein chains that could readily be modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank. On average 24 CAPRI groups and 7 CASP groups submitted docking predictions for each target, and 12 CAPRI groups per target participated in the CAPRI scoring experiment. In total more than 9500 models were assessed against the 3D structures of the corresponding target complexes. Results show that the prediction of homodimer assemblies by homology modeling techniques and docking calculations is quite \u2026",
                "The ability of atomic interaction parameters generated using the Automated Topology Builder and Repository version 3.0 (ATB3.0) to predict experimental hydration free enthalpies (\u0394Gwater) and solvation free enthalpies in the apolar solvent hexane (\u0394Ghexane) is presented. For a validation set of 685 molecules the average unsigned error (AUE) between \u0394Gwater values calculated using the ATB3.0 and experiment is 3.8 kJ\u00b7mol\u20131. The slope of the line of best fit is 1.00, the intercept \u22121.0 kJ\u00b7mol\u20131, and the R2 0.90. For the more restricted set of 239 molecules used to validate OPLS3 ( J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 281\u2212296, DOI: 10.1021\/acs.jctc.5b00864) the AUE using the ATB3.0 is just 2.7 kJ\u00b7mol\u20131 and the R2 0.93. A roadmap for further improvement of the ATB parameters is presented together with a discussion of the challenges of validating force fields against the available experimental data.",
                "Nanovesicles self-assembled from amphiphilic peptides are promising candidates for applications in drug delivery. However, complete high-resolution data on the local and supramolecular organization of such materials has been elusive thus far, which is a substantial obstacle to their rational design. In the absence of precise information, nanovesicles built of amphiphilic \u201clipid-like\u201d peptides are generally assumed to resemble liposomes that are organized from bilayers of peptides with a tail-to-tail ordering. Using the nanocarrier formed by the amphiphilic self-assembling peptide 2 (SA2 peptide) as an example, we derive the local and global organization of a multimega-Dalton peptide-based nanocarrier at high molecular detail and at close-to physiological conditions. By integrating a multitude of experimental techniques (solid-state NMR, AFM, SLS, DLS, FT-IR, CD) with large- and multiscale MD simulations, we \u2026",
                "HADDOCK is one of the few docking programs that can explicitly account for water molecules in the docking process. Its solvated docking protocol starts from hydrated molecules and a fraction of the resulting interfacial waters is subsequently removed in a biased Monte Carlo procedure based on water\u2010mediated contact probabilities. The latter were derived from an analysis of water contact frequencies from high\u2010resolution crystal structures. Here, we introduce a simple water\u2010mediated amino acid\u2013amino acid contact probability scale derived from the Kyte\u2010Doolittle hydrophobicity scale and assess its performance on the largest high\u2010resolution dataset developed to date for solvated docking. Both scales yield high\u2010quality docking results. The novel and simple hydrophobicity scale, which should reflect better the physicochemical principles underlying contact propensities, leads to a performance improvement of \u2026",
                "The segregation of cellular surfaces in heterogeneous patches is considered to be a common motif in bacteria and eukaryotes that is underpinned by the observation of clustering and cooperative gating of signaling membrane proteins such as receptors or channels. Such processes could represent an important cellular strategy to shape signaling activity. Hence, structural knowledge of the arrangement of channels or receptors in supramolecular assemblies represents a crucial step towards a better understanding of signaling across membranes. We herein report on the supramolecular organization of clusters of the K+ channel KcsA in bacterial membranes, which was analyzed by a combination of DNP\u2010enhanced solid\u2010state NMR experiments and MD simulations. We used solid\u2010state NMR spectroscopy to determine the channel\u2013channel interface and to demonstrate the strong correlation between channel \u2026",
                "Protein\u2013protein interactions control a plethora of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Understanding how and why proteins interact will inevitably lead to novel structure\u2010based drug design methods, as well as design of de novo binders with preferred interaction properties. At a structural and molecular level, interface and rim regions are not enough to fully account for the energetics of protein\u2013protein binding, even for simple lock\u2010and\u2010key rigid binders. As we have recently shown, properties of the global surface might also play a role in protein\u2013protein interactions. Here, we report on molecular dynamics simulations performed to understand solvent effects on protein\u2013protein surfaces. We compare properties of the interface, rim, and non\u2010interacting surface regions for five different complexes and their free components. Interface and rim residues become, as \u2026",
                "Interfacial water molecules play an important role in many aspects of protein\u2013DNA specificity and recognition. Yet they have been mostly neglected in the computational modeling of these complexes. We present here a solvated docking protocol that allows explicit inclusion of water molecules in the docking of protein\u2013DNA complexes and demonstrate its feasibility on a benchmark of 30 high-resolution protein\u2013DNA complexes containing crystallographically-determined water molecules at their interfaces. Our protocol is capable of reproducing the solvation pattern at the interface and recovers hydrogen-bonded water-mediated contacts in many of the benchmark cases. Solvated docking leads to an overall improvement in the quality of the generated protein\u2013DNA models for cases with limited conformational change of the partners upon complex formation. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated on \u2026",
                "Our information\u2010driven docking approach HADDOCK is a consistent top predictor and scorer since the start of its participation in the CAPRI community\u2010wide experiment. This sustained performance is due, in part, to its ability to integrate experimental data and\/or bioinformatics information into the modelling process, and also to the overall robustness of the scoring function used to assess and rank the predictions. In the CASP\u2010CAPRI Round 1 scoring experiment we successfully selected acceptable\/medium quality models for 18\/14 of the 25 targets \u2013 a top\u2010ranking performance among all scorers. Considering that for only 20 targets acceptable models were generated by the community, our effective success rate reaches as high as 90% (18\/20). This was achieved using the standard HADDOCK scoring function, which, thirteen years after its original publication, still consists of a simple linear combination of \u2026",
                "In this work we propose a strategy based on quantum mechanical (QM) calculations to parametrize a polarizable force field for use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We investigate the use of multiple atoms-in-molecules (AIM) strategies to partition QM determined molecular electron densities into atomic subregions. The partitioned atomic densities are subsequently used to compute atomic dispersion coefficients from effective exchange-hole-dipole moment (XDM) calculations. In order to derive values for the repulsive van der Waals parameters from first principles, we use a simple volume relation to scale effective atomic radii. Explicit inclusion of higher order dispersion coefficients was tested for a series of alkanes, and we show that combining C6 and C8 attractive terms together with a C11 repulsive potential yields satisfying models when used in combination with our van der Waals parameters and \u2026",
                "The absence of an adequate reversal strategy to prevent and stop potential life-threatening bleeding complications is a major drawback to the clinical use of the direct oral inhibitors of blood coagulation factor Xa. Here we show that specific modifications of the substrate-binding aromatic S4 subpocket within the factor Xa active site disrupt high-affinity engagement of the direct factor Xa inhibitors. These modifications either entail amino-acid substitution of S4 subsite residues Tyr99 and\/or Phe174 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), or extension of the 99-loop that borders the S4 subsite. The latter modifications led to the engineering of a factor Xa variant that is able to support coagulation in human plasma spiked with (supra-) physiological concentrations of direct factor Xa inhibitors. As such, this factor Xa variant has the potential to be employed to bypass the direct factor Xa inhibitor-mediated anticoagulation in patients \u2026"

I have previously pioneered the so-called optical force clamp, a feedback-controlled optical tweezers, which maintains a constant force upon a single moving motor protein (Visscher et al., Nature 400, 184-189). While at the University of Arizona our research has focused on the role of mechanical force in the regulation of gene-expression. We not only investigate how tension in DNA controls initiation of transcription by T7 RNA polymerases, but also how it affects the translocation of ribosomes along mRNA, and how force unfolds downstream mRNA structures known to cause translational recoding (-1 frameshifting, -1 FS).
