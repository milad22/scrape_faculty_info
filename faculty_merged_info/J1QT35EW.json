                "We derive the structure of the density matrix for two Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field to all orders of perturbation theory, in spacetimes admitting a well-defined Wightman function. Calculating all of its leading terms enables us to fully characterize observable correlations, entanglement, and quantum discord. We apply these results to study detector responses in two locally flat topologically nontrivial spacetimes constructed from identifications of Minkowski space. We demonstrate how local statistics and detector-detector correlations depend on the global spacetime structure. In particular, we show that if the spacetime has a preferred direction, this direction may be inferred from the dependence of correlations between the two detectors on their orientation. While using such measurements to distinguish spacetimes with identical local geometry is apparently impractical, this effect points to \u2026",
                "We implement the entanglement harvesting protocol, in which two Unruh\u2013DeWitt detectors become entangled through local interactions with a quantum field, for the first time in the vicinity of a black hole. Our study, focusing on the BTZ black hole, reveals that black holes inhibit entanglement harvesting. For two detectors with fixed proper separation along the radial direction, we demonstrate that the entanglement harvested rapidly falls to zero as the detectors move closer to the horizon. This effect is a combination of black hole radiation and gravitational redshift, both generic properties of horizons, suggesting it is a general result for black holes.",
                "We consider the behavior of bipartite and tripartite nonlocality between fermionic entangled states shared by observers, one of whom uniformly accelerates. We find that while fermionic entanglement persists for arbitrarily large acceleration, the Bell\u2013Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequalities cannot be violated for sufficiently large but finite acceleration. However, the Svetlichny inequality, which is a measure of genuine tripartite nonlocality, can be violated for any finite value of the acceleration.",
                "This article generalizes the conditional probability interpretation of time in which time evolution is realized through entanglement between a clock and a system of interest. This formalism is based upon conditioning a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation on a subsystem of the Universe, serving as a clock, being in a state corresponding to a time . Doing so assigns a conditional state to the rest of the Universe , referred to as the system. We demonstrate that when the total Hamiltonian appearing in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation contains an interaction term coupling the clock and system, the conditional state  satisfies a time-nonlocal Schr\u00f6dinger equation in which the system Hamiltonian is replaced with a self-adjoint integral operator. This time-nonlocal Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved perturbatively and three examples of clock-system interactions are examined. One example considered supposes that the clock and system interact via Newtonian gravity, which leads to the system's Hamiltonian developing corrections on the order of  and inversely proportional to the distance between the clock and system.",
                "We examine in (2+ 1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space the phenomena of entanglement harvesting\u2014the process in which a pair of detectors (two-level atoms) extract entanglement from a quantum field through local interactions with the field. We begin by reviewing the Unruh-DeWitt detector and its interaction with a real scalar field in the vacuum state, as well as the entanglement harvesting protocol in general. We then examine how the entanglement harvested by a pair of such detectors depends on their spacetime trajectory, separation, spacetime curvature, and boundary conditions satisfied by the field. The harvested entanglement is interpreted as an indicator of field entanglement between the localized regions where the detectors interact with the field, and thus this investigation allows us to probe indirectly the entanglement structure of the AdS vacuum. We find an island of separability for specific values \u2026",
                "We study how an arbitrary Gaussian state of two localized wave packets, prepared in an inertial frame of reference, is described by a pair of uniformly accelerated observers. We explicitly compute the resulting state for arbitrarily chosen proper accelerations of the observers and independently tuned distance between them. To do so, we introduce a generalized Rindler frame of reference and analytically derive the corresponding state transformation as a Gaussian channel. Our approach provides several new insights into the phenomenon of vacuum entanglement such as the highly nontrivial effect of spatial separation between the observers including sudden death of entanglement. We also calculate the fidelity of the two-mode channel for nonvacuum Gaussian states and obtain bounds on classical and quantum capacities of a single-mode channel. Our framework can be directly applied to any continuous variable \u2026",
                "The problem of time in quantum gravity calls for a relational solution. Using quantum reduction maps, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between three approaches to relational quantum dynamics: 1) relational observables in the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantization, 2) Page and Wootters'(PW) Schr\u00f6dinger picture formalism, and 3) the relational Heisenberg picture obtained via symmetry reduction. Constituting three faces of the same dynamics, we call this equivalence the trinity. We develop a quantization procedure for relational Dirac observables using covariant POVMs which encompass non-ideal clocks. The quantum reduction maps reveal this procedure as the quantum analog of gauge-invariantly extending gauge-fixed quantities. We establish algebraic properties of these relational observables. We extend a recentclock-neutral'approach to changing temporal reference frames, transforming relational observables and states, and demonstrate a clock dependent temporal nonlocality effect. We show that Kucha\u0159's criticism, alleging that the conditional probabilities of the PW formalism violate the constraint, is incorrect. They are a quantum analog of a gauge-fixed description of a gauge-invariant quantity and equivalent to the manifestly gauge-invariant evaluation of relational observables in the physical inner product. The trinity furthermore resolves a previously reported normalization ambiguity and clarifies the role of entanglement in the PW formalism. The trinity finally permits us to resolve Kucha\u0159's criticism that the PW formalism yields wrong propagators by showing how conditional probabilities of relational observables \u2026",
                "We investigate general optical interferometry in stationary spacetimes focusing on quantum-optical experiments in near-Earth environments. We provide a rigorous expression for the gravitationally induced phase difference and adapt the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism for calculations of polarization rotation. We investigate two optical versions of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment and show that the phase difference is independent of the post-Newtonian parameter \u03b3, making it a possible candidate for an optical test of the Einstein equivalence principle. Polarization rotation provides an example of the quantum clock variable and, while related to the optical Lense-Thirring effects, shows a qualitatively different behavior from them.",
                "The cosmic censorship conjecture posits that singularities forming to the future of a regular Cauchy surface are hidden by an event horizon. Consequently any topological structures will ultimately collapse within the horizon of a black hole and so no observer can actively probe them classically. We consider here a quantum analogue of this problem, in which we compare the transition rates of an Unruh\u2013DeWitt detector placed outside the horizon of an eternal BTZ black hole and its associated geon counterpart. We find the transition rates differ, with the latter being time-dependent, implying that we are indeed able to probe the structure of the singularity from outside the horizon.",
                "In quantum communication protocols the existence of a shared reference frame between two spatially separated parties is normally presumed. However, in many practical situations we are faced with the problem of misaligned reference frames. In this paper, we study communication between two inertial observers who have partial knowledge about the Lorentz transformation that relates their frames of reference. Since every Lorentz transformation can be decomposed into a pure boost followed by a rotation, we begin by analyzing the effects on communication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation relating their frames, when the transformation is either a rotation or a pure boost. This then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication is affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an arbitrary Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, we show how the \u2026"
