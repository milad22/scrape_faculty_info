                "Alex Burant Alex Burant Lecturer, Physics Office: PAS 571 520-621-6827 burant@email.arizona.edu Ph.D. Physics, 2018, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Biological Physics Research Interests: [Not currently research active] My Ph.D. work was in the field of biomedical physics. I characterized various depolarization mechanisms of hyperpolarized xenon during continuous-flow spin exchange optical pumping in search of inefficiencies in the process. Hyperpolarized xenon is an excellent source of image contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gas-phase imaging can be used to generate high-resolution images of the lungs while dissolved-phase imaging and spectroscopy can be used to detect brown adipose tissue in humans.
