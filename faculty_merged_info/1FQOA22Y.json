                "Masahiro Ishigami Associate Professor PSB 110\/ PS 120 & 117 (lab) Ishigami@ucf.edu 510-301-8798 Dr. Ishigami received his Ph.D. in Physics from the\u00a0University of California, Berkeley in 2004. He has been on the faculty\u00a0at UCF since 2008. Highlights I am an expert on scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, transport measurements on nanoscale materials, and nanoscale friction measurements at speeds reaching 1 m\/sec. Using these techniques, I study The impact of atomic scale defects and adsorbates on transport properties in novel 2D materials with exotic electronic structures. The transport properties of chiral-angle known nanotubes (particularly, how individual atoms and molecules affect the device properties) The origin of friction and wear Results are useful to develop a broad scientific foundation for nanotechnology including novel electronic, sensor and friction-reduction technologies. 2016 J.
