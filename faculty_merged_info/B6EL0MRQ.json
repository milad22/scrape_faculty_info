                "John Hauptman I lead the 4th detector, a big high energy physics detector with several new technologies that is suited for a lepton-antilepton collider.   The most recent description is the Letter of Intent found at https:\/\/faculty.sites.iastate.edu\/hauptman\/files\/inline-files\/4LoI.pdf I work with Sehwook Lee on top quark physics with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Colllider. For teaching pleasure, I like our Newspaper Physics course taught out of the daily newspapers and linked with English instruction.  It is intended for first-year students and is a full 3 credits of physics and 3 credits of English. hauptman@iastate.edu 515-451-0034"
