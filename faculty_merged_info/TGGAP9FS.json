                "Apoptosis is initiated when Bcl-2 and its prosurvival relatives are engaged by proapoptotic BH3-only proteins via interaction of its BH3 domain with a groove on the Bcl-2-like proteins. These interactions have been considered promiscuous, but our analysis of the affinity of eight BH3 peptides for five Bcl-2-like proteins has revealed that the interactions vary over 10,000-fold in affinity, and accordingly, only certain protein pairs associate inside cells. Bim and Puma potently engaged all the prosurvival proteins comparably. Bad, however, bound tightly to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w but only weakly to A1 and not to Mcl-1. Strikingly, Noxa bound only Mcl-1 and A1. In accord with their complementary binding, Bad and Noxa cooperated to induce potent killing. The results suggest that apoptosis relies on selective interactions between particular subsets of these proteins and that it should be feasible to discover BH3-mimetic \u2026",
                "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessively inherited autoinflammatory disorder with high carrier frequencies in the Middle East. Pyrin, the protein mutated in FMF, regulates caspase-1 activation and consequently IL-1\u03b2 production through cognate interaction of its N-terminal PYRIN motif with the ASC adaptor protein. However, the preponderance of mutations reside in pyrin\u2019s C-terminal B30.2 domain. Here we demonstrate direct interaction of this domain with caspase-1. In lysates from cells not expressing ASC, reciprocal GST pull-downs demonstrated the interaction of pyrin with the p20 and p10 catalytic subunits of caspase-1. Coimmunoprecipitations of pyrin and caspase-1 from THP-1 human monocytic cells were consistent with the interaction of endogenous proteins. The C-terminal B30.2 domain of pyrin is necessary and sufficient for the interaction, and binding was reduced by FMF-associated B30.2 \u2026",
                "In stressed cells, apoptosis ensues when Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak oligomerize and permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane. Certain BH3-only relatives can directly activate them to mediate this pivotal, poorly understood step. To clarify the conformational changes that induce Bax oligomerization, we determined crystal structures of Bax\u0394C21 treated with detergents and BH3 peptides. The peptides bound the Bax canonical surface groove but, unlike their complexes with prosurvival relatives, dissociated Bax into two domains. The structures define the sequence signature of activator BH3 domains and reveal how they can activate Bax via its groove by favoring release of its BH3 domain. Furthermore, Bax helices \u03b12\u2013\u03b15 alone adopted a symmetric homodimer structure, supporting the proposal that two Bax molecules insert their BH3 domain into each other\u2019s surface groove to nucleate oligomerization \u2026",
                "Several hundred malaria parasite proteins are exported beyond an encasing vacuole and into the cytosol of the host erythrocyte, a process that is central to the virulence and viability of the causative Plasmodium species. The trafficking machinery responsible for this export is unknown. Here we identify in Plasmodium falciparum a translocon of exported proteins (PTEX), which is located in the vacuole membrane. The PTEX complex is ATP-powered, and comprises heat shock protein 101 (HSP101; a ClpA\/B-like ATPase from the AAA+ superfamily, of a type commonly associated with protein translocons), a novel protein termed PTEX150 and a known parasite protein, exported protein 2 (EXP2). EXP2 is the potential channel, as it is the membrane-associated component of the core PTEX complex. Two other proteins, a new protein PTEX88 and thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), were also identified as PTEX components. As a \u2026",
                "Apoptosis is held in check by prosurvival proteins of the Bcl-2 family. The distantly related BH3-only proteins bind to and antagonize them, thereby promoting apoptosis. Whereas binding of the BH3-only protein Noxa to prosurvival Mcl-1 induces Mcl-1 degradation by the proteasome, binding of another BH3-only ligand, Bim, elevates Mcl-1 protein levels. We compared the three-dimensional structures of the complexes formed between BH3 peptides of both Bim and Noxa, and we show that a discrete C-terminal sequence of the Noxa BH3 is necessary to instigate Mcl-1 degradation.",
                "Insulin receptor signalling has a central role in mammalian biology, regulating cellular metabolism, growth, division, differentiation and survival 1, 2. Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease 3; aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers, exacerbated by cross-talk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) 4. Despite more than three decades of investigation, the three-dimensional structure of the insulin\u2013insulin receptor complex has proved elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin \u2026",
                "The prosurvival BCL-2 family protein BCL-X L is often overexpressed in solid tumors and renders malignant tumor cells resistant to anticancer therapeutics. Enhancing apoptotic responses by inhibiting BCL-X L will most likely have widespread utility in cancer treatment and, instead of inhibiting multiple prosurvival BCL-2 family members, a BCL-X L\u2013selective inhibitor would be expected to minimize the toxicity to normal tissues. We describe the use of a high-throughput screen to discover a new series of small molecules targeting BCL-X L and their structure-guided development by medicinal chemistry. The optimized compound, WEHI-539 (7), has high affinity (subnanomolar) and selectivity for BCL-X L and potently kills cells by selectively antagonizing its prosurvival activity. WEHI-539 will be an invaluable tool for distinguishing the roles of BCL-X L from those of its prosurvival relatives, both in normal cells and \u2026",
                "Ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the G2 level have been used toobtain absolute values for the proton affinities of a variety of prototypical smallmolecules. A total of 31 molecules were examined. The results are compared with the current standard proton affinity scale and with more recent revisions of this scale. At the lower end of the proton affinity scale, there is generally good agreement between the theoretical and various experimental proton affinities. At the upper end of the scale, the theoretical proton affinities are closer to the original values. However, it is found that all the results can be substantially reconciled if the currently accepted value of the proton affinity of isobutene, used as an absolute standard in several of the experimental determinations, is adjusted downwards by 10-20 kJ mol-1. The theoretical enthalpies for proton-transfer reactions are consistently within 10 kJ mol-1 of directly measured \u2026",
                "Many cancers possess defects in their apoptotic machinery that provide them with a survival advantage. 1 Hence, one strategy for therapeutic intervention is to develop molecules that activate the cell death pathways. The Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins (eg Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) are attractive drug targets as their overexpression is observed in many tumours and contributes to chemo-and radio therapy resistance. Although there is controversy over how pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins function, 2, 3 it is generally agreed that apoptosis is initiated by the binding of the pro-death BH3-only proteins to the prosurvival molecules. These interactions are mediated by the BH3 domain of the BH3-only proteins (Supplementary Figure 1) inserting into a hydrophobic groove on the surface of prosurvival proteins. Structural analyses of BH3 domain: pro-survival protein complexes show that four conserved hydrophobic residues (h1\u2013h4) on one \u2026",
                "Background: Membrane fusion within the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses is mediated by a surface glycoprotein termed the \u201cF\u201d, or fusion, protein. Membrane fusion is assumed to involve a series of structural transitions of F from a metastable (prefusion) state to a highly stable (postfusion) state. No detail is available at the atomic level regarding the metastable form of these proteins or regarding the transitions accompanying fusion.Results: The three-dimensional structure of the fusion protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV-F) has been determined. The trimeric NDV-F molecule is organized into head, neck, and stalk regions. The head is comprised of a highly twisted \u03b2 domain and an additional immunoglobulin-like \u03b2 domain. The neck is formed by the C-terminal extension of the heptad repeat region HR-A, capped by a four-helical bundle. The C terminus of HR-A is encased by a further helix HR-C and a 4 \u2026"
