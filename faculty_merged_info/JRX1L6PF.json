                "We have measured probability distributions of quadrature-field amplitude for both vacuum and quadrature-squeezed states of a mode of the electromagnetic field. From these measurements we demonstrate the technique of optical homodyne tomography to determine the Wigner distribution and the density matrix of the mode. This provides a complete quantum mechanical characterization of the measured mode.",
                "This review covers the latest developments in continuous-variable quantum-state tomography of optical fields and photons, placing a special emphasis on its practical aspects and applications in quantum-information technology. Optical homodyne tomography is reviewed as a method of reconstructing the state of light in a given optical mode. A range of relevant practical topics is discussed, such as state-reconstruction algorithms (with emphasis on the maximum-likelihood technique), the technology of time-domain homodyne detection, mode-matching issues, and engineering of complex quantum states of light. The paper also surveys quantum-state tomography for the transverse spatial state (spatial mode) of the field in the special case of fields containing precisely one photon."
