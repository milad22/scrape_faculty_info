                "Evaluating the quality of research is essential if findings are to be utilised in practice and incorporated into care delivery. In a previous article we explored \u2018bias\u2019 across research designs and outlined strategies to minimise bias. 1 The aim of this article is to further outline rigour, or the integrity in which a study is conducted, and ensure the credibility of findings in relation to qualitative research. Concepts such as reliability, validity and generalisability typically associated with quantitative research and alternative terminology will be compared in relation to their application to qualitative research. In addition, some of the strategies adopted by qualitative researchers to enhance the credibility of their research are outlined.",
                "Qualitative methods are invaluable for exploring the complexities of health care and patient experiences in particular. Diverse qualitative methods are available that incorporate different ontological and epistemological perspectives. One method of data management that is gaining in popularity among healthcare researchers is the framework approach. We will outline this approach, discuss its relative merits and provide a working example of its application to data management and analysis.",
                "An angular analysis of the B 0\u2192 K* 0 (\u2192 K+ \u03c0\u2212) \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay is presented. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb\u2212 1 of pp collision data collected at the LHCb experiment. The complete angular information from the decay is used to determine CP-averaged observables and CP asymmetries, taking account of possible contamination from decays with the K+ \u03c0\u2212 system in an S-wave configuration. The angular observables and their correlations are reported in bins of q 2, the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system. The observables are determined both from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit and by using the principal moments of the angular distribution. In addition, by fitting for q 2-dependent decay amplitudes in the region 1.1< q 2< 6.0 GeV 2\/c 4, the zero-crossing points of several angular observables are computed. A global fit is performed to the complete set of CP-averaged \u2026",
                "The observation of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark-antiquark pair is reported, based on a combined analysis of proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1, 19.7, and 35.9 fb , respectively. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The results of statistically independent searches for Higgs bosons produced in conjunction with a top quark-antiquark pair and decaying to pairs of W bosons, Z bosons, photons,  leptons, or bottom quark jets are combined to maximize sensitivity. An excess of events is observed, with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations, over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis. The corresponding expected significance from the standard model for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV is 4.2 standard deviations. The combined best fit signal strength normalized to the standard model prediction is 1.26.",

Measurements are reported as a function of q 2, the square of the dimuon invariant mass and results of the angular analysis are found to be consistent with the Standard Model. In the range 1< q 2< 6 GeV 2\/c 4, where precise theoretical calculations are available, the differential branching fraction is found to be more than 3\u03c3 below the Standard Model predictions.",
                "This study sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the prognostic value of myocardial scarring as evidenced by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with known or suspected cardiac sarcoidosis.Although CMR is increasingly used for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis, the prognostic value of CMR has been less well described in this population.PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials were searched for CMR studies with \u22651 year of prognostic data. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite outcome of arrhythmogenic events (ventricular arrhythmia, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock, sudden cardiac death) plus all-cause mortality during follow-up. Summary effect estimates were generated with random-effects modeling.Ten \u2026",

The J\/\u03c8 mesons are reconstructed using the dimuon decay mode. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1. 6 nb\u2212 1. For the first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production ratio are determined separately for prompt J\/\u03c8 mesons and J\/\u03c8 from b-hadron decays. Clear suppression of prompt J\/\u03c8 production with respect to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production of J\/\u03c8 from b-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show good agreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows that cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the \u2026",
                "Nodal, a member of the TGF-\u03b2 family of signaling molecules, has been implicated in pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) [Vallier, L., Reynolds, D., Pedersen, R.A., 2004a. Nodal inhibits differentiation of human embryonic stem cells along the neuroectodermal default pathway. Dev. Biol. 275, 403\u2013421], a finding that seems paradoxical given Nodal's central role in mesoderm\/endoderm specification during gastrulation. In this study, we sought to clarify the role of Nodal signaling during hESC differentiation by constitutive overexpression of the endogenous Nodal inhibitors Lefty2 (Lefty) and truncated Cerberus (Cerb-S) and by pharmacological interference using the Nodal receptor antagonist SB431542. Compared to wildtype (WT) controls, embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from either Lefty or Cerb-S overexpressing hESCs showed increased expression of neuroectoderm markers Sox1, Sox3, and \u2026",
                "The resonant substructures of B 0\u2192 D 0 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 decays are studied with the Dalitz plot technique.

The \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 S-wave components are modeled with the isobar and K-matrix formalisms. Results of the Dalitz plot analyses using both models are presented. A resonant structure at m (D 0 \u03c0\u2212)\u2248 2.8 GeV\/c 2 is confirmed and its spin-parity is determined for the first time as J P= 3\u2212.
