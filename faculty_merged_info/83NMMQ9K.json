                "We study the formalism of the sphaleron approximation to baryon-number violation in the standard model at temperatures near 1 TeV. We investigate small fluctuations of the sphaleron, the competition of large-scale sphalerons with thermal fluctuations, and the damping of the transition rate in the plasma. We find a suppression of the rate due to Landau damping and due to factors arising from zero modes. Our approximations are valid in the regime 2 M W (T)\u226a T\u226a 2 M W (T)\/\u03b1 W for models where \u03bb\u223c g 2. We find that the rate of baryon-number violation is still significantly larger than the expansion rate of the Universe.",

                "Results are presented of a full leading-order evaluation of the shear viscosity, flavor diffusion constants, and electrical conductivity in high temperature QCD and QED. The presence of Coulomb logarithms associated with gauge interactions imply that the leading-order results for transport coefficients may themselves be expanded in an infinite series in powers of 1\/log (1\/g); the utility of this expansion is also examined. A next-to-leading-log approximation is found to approximate the full leading-order result quite well as long as the Debye mass is less than the temperature.",
                "Scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis require an understanding of the effective potential at finite temperature near a first-order electroweak phase transition. Working in the Landau gauge, we present a calculation of the dominant two-loop corrections to the ring-improved one-loop potential in the formal limit g 4\u226a \u03bb\u226a g 2, where \u03bb is the Higgs self-coupling and g is the electroweak coupling. The limit \u03bb\u226a g 2 ensures that the phase transition is significantly first order, and the limit g 4\u226a \u03bb allows us to use high-temperature expansions. We find corrections from 20% to 40% at Higgs-boson masses relevant to the bound computed for baryogenesis in the minimal standard model. Though our numerical results seem to still rule out minimal standard model baryogenesis, this conclusion is not airtight because the loop expansion is only marginal when corrections are as big as 40%. We also discuss why superdaisy \u2026",
                "We compute the photon emission rate of an equilibrated, hot QCD plasma at zero chemical potential, to leading order in both \u03b1 EM and the QCD coupling g s (T). This requires inclusion of near-collinear bremsstrahlung and\\ipa contributions, and correct incorporation of Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal suppression effects for these processes. Analogous results for a QED plasma are also included.",
                "We recently derived, using diagrammatic methods, the leading-order hard photon emission rate in ultra-relativistic plasmas. This requires a correct treatment of multiple scattering effects which limit the coherence length of emitted radiation (the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect). In this paper, we provide a more physical derivation of this result, and extend the treatment to the case of gluon radiation.",
                "We highlight the progress, current status, and open challenges of QCD-driven physics, in theory and in experiment. We discuss how the strong interaction is intimately connected to a broad sweep of physical problems, in settings ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to strongly coupled, complex systems in particle and condensed-matter physics, as well as to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. We also discuss how success in describing the strong interaction impacts other fields, and, in turn, how such subjects can impact studies of the strong interaction. In the course of the work we offer a perspective on the many research streams which flow into and out of QCD, as well as a vision for future developments.",
                "The issue of sphaleron-induced baryon decay and various paradoxes related to the instanton method of computation are addressed. By various examples we argue that there is no contradiction between the instanton estimates and sphaleron estimates, and argue that for electroweak theory these estimates correspond to different approximations for distinct phenomena. We also investigate numerically the nature of the classical decay of a sphaleron in the (1+ 1)-dimensional Abelian Higgs model.",
                "The emission rate of photons from a hot, weakly coupled ultrarelativistic plasma is analyzed. Leading-log results, reflecting the sensitivity of the emission rate to scattering events with momentum transfers from gT to T, have previously been obtained. But a complete leading-order treatment requires including collinearly enhanced, inelastic processes such as bremsstrahlung. These inelastic processes receive O (1) modifications from multiple scattering during the photon emission process, which limits the coherence length of the emitted radiation (the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect). We perform a diagrammatic analysis to identify, and sum, all leading-order contributions. We find that the leading-order photon emission rate is not sensitive to non-perturbative g 2 T scale dynamics. We derive an integral equation for the photon emission rate which is very similar to the result of Migdal in his original discussion of the \u2026",
                "We present a full computation of d\u03c3\/dq T 2 for W, Z and virtual \u03b3 production to second order in QCD. This includes qg, gg, and singlet q q+ qq collisions in addition to the usual non-singlet q q+ qq. The primary motivation is the importance of quark-gluon collisions at Tevatron energies. Attention is restricted to high and moderate q T, avoiding the resummation necessary at small transverse momentum. We give analytic results for all constituent cross-sections d\u03c3\/dq T 2 d y and, for W and Z production, numerically convolute them with structure functions."
