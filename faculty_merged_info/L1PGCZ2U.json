                "This paper is a review of the present status of neutrino mass physics, which grew out of an APS sponsored study of neutrinos in 2004. After a discussion of the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and some popular ways to probe the new physics implied by recent data, it summarizes what can be learned about neutrino interactions as well as the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model from the various proposed neutrino experiments. The intriguing possibility that neutrino mass physics may be at the heart of our understanding of a long standing puzzle of cosmology, ie the origin of matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry is also discussed.",
                "Physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International e+ e-Linear Collider (ILC) will be complementary in many respects, as has been demonstrated at previous generations of hadron and lepton colliders. This report addresses the possible interplay between the LHC and ILC in testing the Standard Model and in discovering and determining the origin of new physics. Mutual benefits for the physics programme at both machines can occur both at the level of a combined interpretation of Hadron Collider and Linear Collider data and at the level of combined analyses of the data, where results obtained at one machine can directly influence the way analyses are carried out at the other machine. Topics under study comprise the physics of weak and strong electroweak symmetry breaking, supersymmetric models, new gauge theories, models with extra dimensions, and electroweak and QCD precision \u2026",
                "We derive simple analytical formulae for the renormalization group running of neutrino masses, leptonic mixing angles and CP phases, which allow an easy understanding of the running. Particularly for a small angle \u03b813 the expressions become very compact, even when non-vanishing CP phases are present. Using these equations we investigate: (i) the influence of Dirac and Majorana phases on the evolution of all parameters, (ii) the implications of running neutrino parameters for leptogenesis, (iii) changes of the mass bounds from WMAP and neutrinoless double \u03b2 decay experiments, relevant for high-energy mass models, (iv) the size of radiative corrections to \u03b813 and \u03b823 and implications for future precision measurements.",
                "We systematically analyze quantum corrections in see-saw scenarios, including effects from above as well as below the see-saw scales. We derive approximate renormalization group equations for neutrino masses, lepton mixings and CP phases, yielding an analytic understanding and a simple estimate of the size of the effects. Even for hierarchical masses, they often exceed the precision of future experiments. Furthermore, we provide a software package allowing for a convenient numerical renormalization group analysis, with heavy singlets being integrated out successively at their mass thresholds. We also discuss applications to model building and related topics.",
                "We explore a \u201cfertile patch\u201d of the heterotic landscape based on a Z 6-II orbifold with SO (10) and E 6 local GUT structures. We search for models allowing for the exact MSSM spectrum. Our result is that of order 100 out of a total 3\u00d7 10 4 inequivalent models satisfy this requirement.",
                "We re-derive the renormalization group equation for the effective coupling of the dimension five operator which corresponds to a Majorana mass matrix for the Standard Model neutrinos. We find a result which differs somewhat from earlier calculations, leading to modifications in the evolution of leptonic mixing angles and CP phases. We also present a general method for calculating \u03b2-functions from counterterms in MS-like renormalization schemes, which works for tensorial quantities.",
                "We study the origin of non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries in superstring theory. We classify all possible non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries which can appear in heterotic orbifold models. These symmetries include D 4 and \u0394 (54). We find that the symmetries of the couplings are always larger than the symmetries of the compact space. This is because they are a consequence of the geometry of the orbifold combined with the space group selection rules of the string. We also study possible breaking patterns. Our analysis yields a simple geometric understanding of the realization of non-Abelian flavor symmetries.",
                "We present a Z 6 orbifold compactification of the E 8\u00d7 E 8 heterotic string which leads to the (supersymmetric) standard model gauge group and matter content. The quarks and leptons appear as three 16-plets of SO (10), whereas the Higgs fields do not form complete SO (10) multiplets. The model has large vacuum degeneracy. For generic vacua, no exotic states appear at low energies and the model is consistent with gauge coupling unification. The top quark Yukawa coupling arises from gauge interactions and is of the order of the gauge couplings, whereas the other Yukawa couplings are suppressed.",
                "Consistent uplifting of AdS vacua in string theory often requires extra light degrees of freedom in addition to those of a (K\u00e4hler) modulus. Here we consider the possibility that de Sitter and Minkowski vacua arise due to hidden sector matter interactions. We find that, in this scheme, the hierarchically small supersymmetry breaking scale can be explained by the scale of gaugino condensation and that interesting patterns of the soft terms arise. In particular, a matter-dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario and a version of the mirage mediation scheme appear in the framework of spontaneously broken supergravity.",
                "In a previous paper, referred to as a \u201cMini-Landscape\u201d search, we explored a \u201cfertile patch\u201d of the heterotic landscape based on a Z 6\u2212 II orbifold with SO (10) and E 6 local grand unified theory structures. In the present paper we extend this analysis. We find many models with the minimal supersymmetric standard model spectra and an exact R parity. In all of these models, the vectorlike exotics decouple along D-flat directions. We present two benchmark models which satisfy many of the constraints of a realistic supersymmetric model, including nontrivial Yukawa matrices for three families of quarks and leptons and Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos with nontrivial seesaw masses for the three light neutrinos. In an appendix we comment on the important issue of string selection rules and, in particular, the so-called \u201cgamma-rule\u201d."
