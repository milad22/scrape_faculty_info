                "Ionic specificity effects, ie, ions of the same valence leading to different macroscopic effects, are studied by considering a Langmuir monolayer of arachidic acid over a solution containing either Fe 3+ or La 3+. We systematically vary p H levels as a way to control the interfacial surface charge and characterize the system by surface-sensitive x-ray scattering and spectroscopic techniques. We show that the critical surface pressure at the tilted (L 2) to untilted (L S) transition is ionic specific and varies with p H. While the maximum density of surface bound La 3+ per head group of arachidic acid is\u223c 0.3, the amount necessary to neutralize the surface charge, for Fe 3+ it is nearly 0.6 and it is accompanied with a significant accumulation of the coions Cl\u2212 as revealed by surface x-ray spectroscopy. We account for the experimental observations by a statistical mechanical model including ion specificity."
