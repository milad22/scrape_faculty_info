                "Discourse analysis is a term that has come to have different interpretations for scholars working in different disciplines. For a sociolinguist, it is concerned mainly with the structure of social interaction manifested in conversation; for a psycholinguist, it is primarily concerned with the nature of comprehension of short written texts; for the computational linguist, it is concerned with producing operational models of text-understanding within highly limited contexts. In this textbook, first published in 1983, the authors provide an extensive overview of the many and diverse approaches to the study of discourse, but base their own approach centrally on the discipline which, to varying degrees, is common to them all-linguistics. Using a methodology which has much in common with descriptive linguistics, they offer a lucid and wide-ranging account of how forms of language are used in communication. Their principal concern is to examine how any language produced by man, whether spoken or written, is used to communicate for a purpose in a context.",
                "Understand the human place in a digital world.\u201cShould be read by anyone interested in understanding the future,\u201d The Times Literary Supplement raved about the original edition of The Social Life of Information. We\u2019re now living in that future, and one of the seminal books of the Internet Age is more relevant than ever. The future was a place where technology was supposed to empower individuals and obliterate social organizations. Pundits predicted that information technology would spell the end of almost everything\u2014from mass media to bureaucracies, universities, politics, and governments. Clearly, we are not living in that future. The Social Life of Information explains why. John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid show us how to look beyond mere information to the social context that creates and gives meaning to it. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays, even\u2014perhaps especially\u2014in the digital world, The Social Life of Information gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. It shows how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, working, and innovating can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives. With a new introduction by David Weinberger and reflections by the authors on developments since the book\u2019s first publication, this new edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the human place in a digital world.",
                "Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013.Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes.

                "In Macroecology, James H. Brown proposes a radical new research agenda designed to broaden the scope of ecology to encompass vast geographical areas and very long time spans. While much ecological research is narrowly focused and experimental, providing detailed information that cannot be used to generalize from one ecological community or time period to another, macroecology draws on data from many disciplines to create a less detailed but much broader picture with greater potential for generalization. Integrating data from ecology, systematics, evolutionary biology, paleobiology, and biogeography to investigate problems that could only be addressed on a much smaller scale by traditional approaches, macroecology provides a richer, more complete understanding of how patterns of life have moved across the earth over time. Brown also demonstrates the advantages of macroecology for conservation, showing how it allows scientists to look beyond endangered species and ecological communities to consider the long history and large geographic scale of human impacts. An important reassessment of the direction of ecology by one of the most influential thinkers in the field, this work will shape future research in ecology and other disciplines.\" This approach may well mark a major new turn in the road in the history of ecology, and I find it extremely exciting. The scope of Macroecology is tremendous and the book makes use of its author's exceptionally broad experience and knowledge. An excellent and important book.\"\u2014Lawrence R. Heaney, Center for Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, the Field Museum",
                "There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in \u2026",
                "Teaching the Spoken Language is about teaching the spoken language. It presents in a highly accessible form the results of the author's important research on teaching and assessing effective spoken communication. The authors examine the nature of spoken language and how it differs from written language both in form and purpose. A large part of it is concerned with principles and techniques for teaching spoken production and listening comprehension. An important chapter deals with how to assess spoken language. The principles and techniques described apply to the teaching of English as a foreign and second language, and are also highly relevant to the teaching of the mother tongue.",
                "Zebrafish have become a popular organism for the study of vertebrate gene function 1, 2. The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease 3, 4, 5. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding \u2026",
                "Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes affecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015.We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures.

Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing.

                "Robert Brown Distinguished University Professor and Institute Professor robert.brown@case.edu 216.368.4010 Rockefeller Building 204 MY PHYSICS WORLD CIRCA 2017 Overview I have collaborated on industrial physics with over a dozen high-tech companies for upwards of 30 years and worked longer than that (50 years!) on astroparticle and education physics. I\u2019ve played a prideful role in the emergence of five new manufacturing (!) companies, and I\u2019ve mentored more than 100 postdocs, doctorates, master\u2019s students and undergraduates. My research group efforts have resulted in over 200 published papers and abstracts, my former students hold at least 150 patents (ten co-authored by me) and we have worked in radiation physics, MRI, PET, CT, electromagnetics, inverse methods, mechanical and thermal modeling, nonlinear dynamics, EEG, MEG, industrial and medical sensors, and physics education, as well as a professional-life-long involvement in elementary particle physics and cosmology. Other Milestones The truly fulfilling nature of a physics career in teaching and research certainly stems not only from its depth and variety, but also from the close collaboration of students. In my case, a beginning devotion to basic astroparticle physics extended to industrial (especially MRI) research, and an added focus on physics education research, all involved even very young students. Spin-offs from the teaching include the writing of a 1000-page MRI textbook (it\u2019s been called the big green book and the daily companion of the MRI scientist ), the creation of GRE flashcards (more than 3000 students from all over the globe have hard copies and, now, web and smartphone apps http:\/\/www.phys.cwru.edu\/flashcards\/ ), and a project \u2018What your fifth- grader needs to know about college physics!\u2019. In a pioneering entrepreneurial physics master\u2019s program, I have co-advised most of its 50 graduates to date. Most recently, our team, which included an undergraduate who wrote his senior thesis on the subject, has won a \u201cPatent for Humanity\u201d award from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the invention of a magneto-optical battery-operated malaria detection device (cheap, portable, fast). See below for further developments. Details Our principal applied areas are simulations in imaging (dominated by MRI but with increased attention paid to PET, CT, and radiotherapy) and of electromagnetic sensors. Finite element, FDTD, and Monte Carlo codes are important computational tools, along with analytical methods such as functional analysis with constraints. We engage in mathematical modeling of instruments and other electromagnetic systems and we optimize on those models in terms of their parameters, leading to such results as a \u201csupershielding criterion\u201d for optimizing magnetic and electric field confinement. My present and former students and I have initiated\/designed three decades of MRI complete system (main, gradient, rf) commercial magnetic coil products, working with both large OEMs and those start-ups I mentioned above. (One of those start-ups began in my computational lab, Quality Electrodynamics, which now \u2013 2017 \u2013 has more than 170 employees, at least 20 of whom trained in our physics department. The CEO\/president obtained his Ph.D. with me, and thanks to his efforts, QED was ranked 11th among America\u2019s twenty best young companies by Forbes Magazine in 2009 and has won many other awards. An early basic research activity has been theoretical calculations in support of new high-energy experiments, especially novel tests of the electroweak parameters through the production of pairs of weak bosons. (We discovered \u201cradiation symmetry\u201d in this way.) A series of experiments were performed in the subsequent years, and the latest round of boson-pair experiments reported in the last couple of years confirmed the original \u201cradiation zero\u201d and yielded refined constraints on trilinear couplings for the bosons. There is a new generation of radiation-zero experiments planned and carried out at the LHC in Switzerland. This past year has seen a former student and myself extend the radiation symmetry ideas to the radiation of gluons in quark physics. Other basic research has dwelt upon cosmology (e.g., solutions to cosmic string equations) and fluid nonlinear analysis (e.g., stability of solitary waves under large perturbations). In the area of physics education research we have identified a \u201cpost-exam syndrome\u201d and worked on the problem of a \u201cteflon education.\u201d In the first, we consider the dilemma of students with unresolved difficulties associated with their exam performance and, in the second, we address ways to improve learning retention by novel repetition methods (\u201ccycling\u201d). At the present time, we have had at least twelve different lecturers employ cycling for more than two-dozen introductory classes at four different universities. In summary, I point to the many marvelous undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate collaborators who have led much of the above efforts. You can understand from what I have already said that the two most important words in my professional life are indeed \u201cformer students.\u201d As for recent events, our industrial design work and its 30-year history have led to the official designation of our research group as OPTIMISE (Ohio Platform for Tomorrow\u2019s Industrial Medical Imaging Systems and Equipment \u2013 http:\/\/optimise.case.edu\/ ) serving an increasing number of companies in the commercialization of their products. We were invited to describe our cycling method in \u201cThe Physics Teacher.\u201d And just now led by my former and present students we have followed up on our malaria detector to use related technology to invent a similarly fast, portable, cheap monitor of oil contaminants in the prediction of engine failure in a wide variety of industrial applications, and we have just started up a new company, Crystics (Crystalline Diagnostics) LLC.
