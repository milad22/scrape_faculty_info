                "An effective action and potential for composite operators is obtained. The formalism is used to analyze, by variational techniques, dynamical symmetry breaking and coherent solutions to field theory. A Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is introduced which replaces arbitrary variations with parametric variations. Previously unsolved nonlinear equations become, in the Rayleigh-Ritz approximation, solvable algebraic equations.",
                "A systematic search is made for all renormalizable theories of heavy vector bosons. It is argued that in any renormalizable Lagrangian theory high-energy unitarity bounds should not be violated in perturbation theory (apart from logarithmic factors in the energy). This leads to the specific requirement of \u201ctree unitarity\u201e; the N-particle S-matrix elements in the tree approximation must grow no more rapidly than E4-N in the limit of high energy (E) at fixed, nonzero angles (i.e., at angles such that all invariants Pi \u2212 Pj i\u2260j, grow like E2). We have imposed this tree-unitarity criterion on the most general scalar, spinor, and vector Lagrangian with terms of mass dimension less than or equal to four; a certain class of nonpolynomial Lagrangians is also considered. It is proved that any such theory is tree-unitary if and only if it is equivalent under a point transformation to a spontaneously broken gauge theory, possibly modified by \u2026",
                "We study the formation of a mass gap, or effective gluon mass (and consequent dimensionful parameters such as the string tension, glueball mass,< Tr G \u03bc \u03bd 2>, correlation lengths) in continuum QCD, using a special set of Schwinger-Dyson equations. These equations are derived from a resummation of the Feynman graphs which represent certain gauge-invariant color-singlet Green's functions, and are themselves essentially gauge invariant. This resummation is essential to the multiplicative renormalizability of QCD in the light-cone gauge, which we adopt for technical reasons. We close the dynamical equations by\" solving\" a Ward identity, a procedure which, while exact in the infrared regime, is subject to ambiguities and corrections in the ultraviolet regime which are beyond the scope of the present work.(These ambiguities are less prominent for QCD in three dimensions, which we discuss also.) As discussed \u2026",
                "Ring current protons (<50 kev), which are unaffected by ion cyclotron waves outside the plasmapause, undergo strong turbulent diffusion just inside the plasmapause. Lifetimes from ion cyclotron turbulence are predicted to be of the order of 1 hour, as observed by Frank for 3\u2264L\u22645. During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, the protons rapidly diffuse across the plasmapause (probably at the Bohm rate) and are lost before reaching the noon meridian, thus giving rise to the asymmetric part of the ring current. During recovery phase the ring current decays on a time scale of a day or less, as the turbulent region moves outward with the expansion of the plasmapause. Further decay takes place on a charge exchange time scale.",
                "By resumming the Feynman graphs which contribute to any gauge-invariant process we explicitly construct, at one-loop order, a three-gluon vertex for QCD which is completely independent of the choice of gauge. This vertex satisfies a Ward identity of the type encountered in ghost-free gauges, relating the vertex to the proper self-energy of a previously constructed gluon propagator, also found by resumming graphs; like the vertex, this self-energy is completely gauge invariant. We also derive the gauge-invariant propagator and vertex via a second related technique which minimizes the dependence on embedding these objects in a gauge-invariant process; the same results are found as in the first technique. These results motivate a toy model of the nonlinear Schwinger-Dyson equation satisfied by the exact gauge-invariant three-gluon vertex. This model is nonperturbative and has infrared singularities, which we \u2026",
                "We have made a systematic search for theories of interacting heavy vector mesons which have unitarily bound trees. In simple cases (four vector mesons and one scalar particle) the only unitarily bound models are spontaneously broken gauge theories. Evidently, a unitarity bound, which controls high-energy behavior, imposes internal symmetry on heavy-vector-boson interactions.",
                "A model for the generation of pearl\u2010type micropulsations in the 0.1\u20135 cps range is presented. Under a different set of conditions, the model is also applicable to the generation of VLF emissions in the whistler mode. It is proposed that a beam of trapped protons at L \u2265 4, supersonic with respect to the local Alfv\u00e9n speed, emits hydromagnetic waves at a frequency corresponding to the occurrence of a cyclotron instability. These hydromagnetic waves propagate along the earth's field lines and are reflected back along the line at the ionosphere. On each pass of a wave packet through the proton beam, energy is supplied to the wave by the particles via the instability. Certain features of the observed fine structure of micropulsations are explained with the concept of bouncing hydromagnetic wave packets. A possible candidate for the necessary proton beam is the belt of 200\u2013500 kev protons observed by Davis and \u2026",
                "By combining the ideas of Nambu in his study of superconductivity and of Johnson, Baker, and Willey in their approach to electrodynamics we construct a gauge theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking which is free of elementary spin-zero fields. The theory contains two fermions and two vector mesons, one of which acquires a mass via the Higgs mechanism. A formula for this vector-meson mass is derived which becomes exact, and nonzero, in the limit as the strength of interaction is appropriately scaled to zero. The vacuum energy is also discussed.",
                "We propose that SAR arcs are generated at the plasmapause as a consequence of the turbulent dissipation of ring current energy. During the recovery phase of a geomagnetic storm, the plasmapause expands outward into the symmetric ring current. When the cold plasma densities reach about 100 cm\u22123, ring current protons (Ep\u223c20 kev) become unstable and generate intense ion cyclotron wave turbulence in a narrow region \u00bd RE wide (just inside the plasmapause). Approximately one\u2010half of the ring current energy is dissipated into wave turbulence, which in turn is absorbed through a Landau resonant interaction with plasmaspheric electrons. The combined thermal heat flux to the ionosphere due to Landau absorption of the wave energy and proton\u2010electron Coulomb dissipation is sufficient to drive SAR arcs at the observed intensities. We thus predict that the arcs should be localized to a narrow latitudinal \u2026",
                "Recent work in both lattice and continuum QCD shows that the gauge field is massive. We investigate the bound states of massive gluons with a Schr\u00f6dinger equation and find M(0++) \u2248 2.3 m, M(0\u2212+) \u2248 2.7 m, M(2++) \u2248 3.2 m, where m is the gluon mass; we expect from this as well as earlier work that m \u2248 500 MeV. These glueballs have widths typical of allowed hadronic decays."

I have also worked fairly recently on the applications of non-Abelian \n      gauge theories to the early universe, in primordial magnetic fields and baryon asymmetry. The main technical tool for investigations of non-Abelian gauge theories is the pinch technique that I introduced in 1981, which \n      allows one to extract gauge-invariant off-shell Green's functions from the S-matrix. The final result, found later by my ex-graduate \n      student Joannis Papavassiliou and his ex-student Daniele Binosi, is that such gauge-invariant Green's functions are precisely those \n      of the background-field Feynman gauge. (String theorists found the same connection by off-shell extrapolations of string theory \n      derived gauge theory amplitudes, by enforcing modular invariance.) This and many other results on the pinch technique and its applications to confinement, chiral symmetry breakdown, electroweak \n      theory, and even supersymmetry, appear in the book: \"The Pinch Technique and Applications to Non-Abelian Gauge Theories\", Cambridge \n      University Press, 2011\" by Cornwall, Papavassiliou, and Binosi. In earlier years I and my colleagues wrote some of the first papers on dynamical symmetry breaking and on three-loop perturbation \n      theory in non-Abelian gauge theories; derived the equivalence theorem relating Goldstone bosons and longitudinal modes of non-Abelian \n      gauge bosons; worked out the properties of the effective potential to all orders; and found many valuable results in multi-particle \n      scattering at high energies. I spent many years working on near-earth space plasma physics and published some 40 papers, although \n      I am no longer active in this field. This research included fundamental results in auroral and magnetospheric physics, including generation of parallel electric fields \n      and wave-particle interactions that cause precipitation and diffusion of ring-current particles.
