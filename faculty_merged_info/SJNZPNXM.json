Lam invented bowlics (1982), one of three existing types of liquid crystals in the world; active walks (1992), a new paradigm in complex systems; and two new disciplines-- histophysics (2002) and science matters (2007\/2008). He published 16 books and over 180 scientific papers ; the books include Introduction to Nonlinear Physics (1997), Nonlinear Physics for Beginners (1998), This Pale Blue Dot (2004), Science Matters (2008), Arts: A Science Matter (2011), and All About Science: Philosophy, History, Sociology & Communication (2014). He is the founder of the International Liquid Crystal Society (1990); cofounder of the Chinese Liquid Crystal Society (1980); founder and editor\n                           of two book series, Science Matters (World Scientific) and Partially Ordered Systems (Springer). His current research is in scimat (science matters), complex systems, and philosophy; scimat website: www.sjsu.edu\/people\/lui.lam\/scimat.\n                           Email: lui2002lam@yahoo.com .
