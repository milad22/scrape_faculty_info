                "The late Cretaceous to early Tertiary sediments of the Kodiak accretionary complex preserve the earliest deformation associated with underthrusting along a thickly sedimented convergent margin. Because of the thick trench fill, this early deformation resulted in the formation of two distinct structural terranes: (1) coherent terranes of layered turbidites and (2) melange terranes. The earliest deformation (D1) in the coherent terranes is marked by normal faults, mineralized layer\u2010perpendicular veins in sandstones, and microfaults in shales. These features suggest that \u03c31 was vertical and that \u03c33 was horizontal and NW trending during D1. We interpret D1 structures as hydrofractures that formed in flat\u2010lying sediments with high fluid pressures caused by rapid tectonic loading. In contrast, the melanges appear to record a more protracted and complex history that culminated in structures similar to the D1 structures above \u2026",
                "Sediments accreted at subduction zones undergo stratal disruption and form a type of melange. The thickness of the disrupted zones grows with progressive deformation. This suggests that initial fault surfaces are abandoned and deformation propagates into adjacent undeformed sediment. Factors causing the abandonment of fault surfaces during continuing deformation include (1) strengthening owing to porosity loss during consolidation, (2) localized drops in fluid pressure on fault surfaces that act as dewaterinig conduits, and (3) reorientation of fault surfaces. The disruptive processes occurring in accretionary prisms result principally from the deformation of a consolidating sediment mass.",
                "The main objective of Leg 131 was to provide data on the deformational processes and associated hydrogeology of the Nankai prism toe. Drilling succeeded, for the first time in the history of ocean drilling, in penetrating the complete sedimentary sequence to basaltic basement, reaching 1327 mbsf (metres below seafloor) with good core recovery (55%). Excellent correlation of the lithology and structure, including the frontal thrust and the decollement, with seismic reflection images was also determined.Bedding dips, faults and shear bands analyzed in the cores confirm the pattern of deformation to be mainly due to NW-SE shortening, as expected from the plate tectonic convergence vector. Below the decollement, no significant deformation features were observed, indicating that the decollement is a sharp discontinuity in stress transmission.Physical properties data show major discontinuities at the decollement \u2026",
                "The Ghost Rocks Formation represents the youngest phase of a Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary episode of accretion during which about 80 percent of Kodiak Island was added to the continental margin. The formation consists of both structurally coherent terranes and terranes of complexly deformed sandstone-shale melange. Two mesoscopically ductile and regionally occurring deformations and three younger, relatively brittle deformations have affected the melange. D1 is characterized by a foliation, S], which dips northwest and a Iineation, L1, which plunges gently southwest. 81 is de\ufb01ned by disrupted Iithologic layering, pinch and swell structures, the alignment of inclusions, and an anastomosing cleavage in the shales. L1 is de\ufb01ned by pinch and swell axes, the long axes of inclusions, mullions, and folds of phyllosilicates in the shales. D2 is characterized by a foliation, $2, and a Iineation, L2, which respectively dip and plunge parallel to the D1 fabrics. S; is a closely spaced, roughly planar, slaty-Iike cleavage that commonly transposes, but only locally folds Sl. L2 is de\ufb01ned by D2 fold axes and the intersection of S] and S; which locally is a pencil cleavage. D1 signi\ufb01cantly and substantially altered the original stratigraphy in the melange, and the distinctive disruptive style of the melange is probably a direct consequence of this deformation. The most important structural ele-ment that contributed to this deformation, and therefore to SI and L1, was a three-dimensional web structure of cataclastic shear zones. This structural element occurs in essentially every sandstone in the melange and suggests, but does not prove, that D1 was tectonically \u2026",
                "The Kodiak Islands of Alaska are principally composed of a Late Cretaceous and Paleogene complex of accreted deep\u2010sea rocks. An early Paleocene magmatic event invaded the accretionary complex with mid\u2010ocean ridge basalt (MORB), andesite, and granodiorite. Geochemical evidence suggests both the andesite and granodiorite are mixtures of MORB and sediment. The volcanic rocks are interlayered with coarse clastic sediments and deformed with the latter; the granodioritic intrusions, with K\u2010Ar ages as old as 62 Ma postdate emplacement of the early Paleocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Interaction of the subduction complex with the Kula\u2010Farallon ridge most simply explains this early Paleocene magmatic episode. Paleomagnetic studies of the volcanic rocks indicate this interaction occurred at 40.3\u00b16\u00b0 north latitude, which is 25.3\u00b19\u00b0 south of the expected position of the Kodiak Islands relative to \u2026"
