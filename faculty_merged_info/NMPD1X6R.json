                "An exact relativistic single-integral formula for the thermal average of the annihilation cross section times velocity, the key quantity in the determination of the cosmic relic abundance of a species, is obtained. Since it does not require expansion of the cross section at low relative velocity, it can also be used when the cross section varies rapidly with energy, e.g. near the formation of a resonance or the opening of a new annihilation channel. We discuss approximate formulas in these cases, and we find that dips in the relic density near resonances are significantly broader and shallower than previously thought and that spurious reductions near thresholds disappear.",
                "Neutrino masses are included in the Weinberg-Salam model in the most economical way. They appear as a manifestation of a new low-mass scale at which the global symmetry of lepton number is spontaneously broken. Two new particles, a Goldstone boson - the majoron - and a neutral Higgs with low mass, appear coupled strongly to neutrinos but so weakly to the other fermions that they cannot be detected at present laboratory energies.",
                "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5\u00d7 10 18 eV, derived from 20 000 events recorded at the Pierre Auger Observatory, is described. The spectral index \u03b3 of the particle flux, J\u221d E\u2212 \u03b3, at energies between 4\u00d7 10 18 eV and 4\u00d7 10 19 eV is 2.69\u00b10.02 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst), steepening to 4.2\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst) at higher energies. The hypothesis of a single power law is rejected with a significance greater than 6 standard deviations. The data are consistent with the prediction by Greisen and by Zatsepin and Kuz\u2019min.",
                "Dark matter is among the most important open problems in modern physics. Aimed at graduate students and researchers, this book describes the theoretical and experimental aspects of the dark matter problem in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Featuring contributions from 48 leading theorists and experimentalists, it presents many aspects, from astrophysical observations to particle physics candidates, and from the prospects for detection at colliders to direct and indirect searches. The book introduces observational evidence for dark matter along with a detailed discussion of the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations and alternative explanations in terms of modified gravity. It then moves on to the candidates arising from theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and to the prospects for detection at accelerators. It concludes by looking at direct and indirect dark matter searches, and the prospects for detecting the particle nature of dark matter with astrophysical experiments.\u2022 Describes the theoretical and experimental aspects of the dark matter problem\u2022 Presents observations, theory and experiments to give a complete and consistent understanding of dark matter\u2022 Features contributions from leading experts in the field",
                "We describe the measurement of the depth of maximum, X max\ufeff, of the longitudinal development of air showers induced by cosmic rays. Almost 4000 events above 10 18 eV observed by the fluorescence detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory in coincidence with at least one surface detector station are selected for the analysis. The average shower maximum was found to evolve with energy at a rate of (106\u2212 21+ 35) g\/cm 2\/decade below 10 18.24\u00b10.05 eV, and (24\u00b13) g\/cm 2\/decade above this energy. The measured shower-to-shower fluctuations decrease from about 55 to 26 g\/cm 2. The interpretation of these results in terms of the cosmic ray mass composition is briefly discussed.",
                "We report a measurement of the flux of cosmic rays with unprecedented precision and statistics using the Pierre Auger Observatory. Based on fluorescence observations in coincidence with at least one surface detector we derive a spectrum for energies above 10 18 eV. We also update the previously published energy spectrum obtained with the surface detector array. The two spectra are combined addressing the systematic uncertainties and, in particular, the influence of the energy resolution on the spectral shape. The spectrum can be described by a broken power law E\u2212 \u03b3 with index \u03b3= 3.3 below the ankle which is measured at log 10 (E ankle\/eV)= 18.6. Above the ankle the spectrum is described by a power law with index 2.6 followed by a flux suppression, above about log 10 (E\/eV)= 19.5, detected with high statistical significance."
