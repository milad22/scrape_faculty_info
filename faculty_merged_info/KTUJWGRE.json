                "Ultrafast optical spectroscopy methods, such as transient absorption spectroscopy and 2D spectroscopy, are widely used across many disciplines. However, these techniques are typically restricted to optically thick samples, such as solids and liquid solutions. Using a frequency comb laser and optical cavities, we present a technique for performing ultrafast optical spectroscopy with high sensitivity, enabling work in dilute gas-phase molecular beams. Resonantly enhancing the probe pulses, we demonstrate transient absorption measurements with a detection limit of \u0394OD=2\u00d710^\u221210 (1\u00d710^\u22129\/Hz). Resonantly enhancing the pump pulses allows us to produce a high excitation fraction at a high repetition rate, so that signals can be recorded from samples with optical densities as low as OD\u224810^\u22128, or column densities <10^10\u2009\u2009molecules\/cm^2. To our knowledge, this represents a 5000-fold improvement of the state \u2026",
                "First high-resolution IR spectra of jet-cooled vinyl radical in the C\ue5f8H stretch region are reported. Detailed spectral assignments and least squares fits to an A-reduction Watson asymmetric top Hamiltonian yield rotational constants and vibrational origins for three A-type bands, assigned to single quantum excitation of the symmetric CH2 stretch. Two of the observed bands arise definitively from ground state vinyl radical, as rigorously confirmed by combination differences predicted from previous midinfrared CH2 wagging studies of Kanamori et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 92, 197 (1990)] as well as millimeter wave rotation-tunneling studies of Tanaka et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 120, 3604 (2004)]. The two bands reflect transitions out of symmetric (0+) and antisymmetric (0\u2212) tunneling levels of vinyl radical populated at 14K slit-jet expansion temperatures. The band origins for the lower-lower (0+\u21900+) and upper-upper (0\u2212\u21900 \u2026",
                "We present a detailed description of the design, construction, and performance of high-power ultrafast Yb:fiber laser frequency combs in operation in our laboratory. We discuss two such laser systems: an 87 MHz, 9 W, 85 fs laser operating at 1060 nm and an 87 MHz, 80 W, 155 fs laser operating at 1035 nm. Both are constructed using low-cost, commercially available components, and can be assembled using only basic tools for cleaving and splicing single-mode fibers. We describe practical methods for achieving and characterizing low-noise single-pulse operation and long-term stability from Yb:fiber oscillators based on nonlinear polarization evolution. Stabilization of the combs using a variety of transducers, including a new method for tuning the carrier-envelope offset frequency, is discussed. High average power is achieved through chirped-pulse amplification in simple fiber amplifiers based on double-clad \u2026",
                "High resolution infrared spectra for four 2\u03a0\u20132\u03a3+ bands of jet-cooled ethynyl radical (i.e., C2H) in the gas phase are reported. The combination of (i) slit-jet cooling (Trot \u2248 12 K) and (ii) sub-Doppler resolution (\u2248 60 MHz) permits satellite branches in each 2\u03a0\u20132\u03a3+ band to be observed and resolved for the first time as well as help clarify a systematic parity misassignment from previous studies. The observed lines in each band are least squares fit to a Hamiltonian model containing rotational, spin-rotational, spin-orbit, and lambda-doubling contributions for the 2\u03a0 state, from which we report revised excited state constants and band origins for the observed bands. Three of the four bands fit extremely well within a conventional 2\u03a0 model (i.e., \u03c3 < 20 MHz), while one band exhibits a local perturbation due to an avoided crossing with a near resonant dark state. Vibronic assignments are given for the observed bands, with \u2026",
                "The first high-resolution IR spectra of a jet-cooled phenyl radical are reported, obtained via direct absorption laser spectroscopy in a slit-jet discharge supersonic expansion. The observed A-type band arises from fundamental excitation of the out-of-phase symmetric CH stretch mode (\u03bd19) of b2 symmetry. Unambiguous spectral assignment of the rotational structure to the phenyl radical is facilitated by comparison with precision 2-line combination differences from Fourier transform microwave and direct absorption mm-wave measurements on the ground state [R. J. McMahon et al., Astrophys. J., 2003, 590, L61]. Least-squares fits to an asymmetric top Hamiltonian permit the upper-state rotational constants to be obtained. The corresponding gas-phase vibrational band origin at 3071.8904 (10) cm\u22121 is in remarkably good agreement with previous matrix isolation studies [A. V. Friderichsen et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc \u2026",
                "High-resolution, fully rotationally resolved direct absorption spectra of hydroxymethyl radical, CH2OH, are presented in the infrared CH stretching region. As a result of low rotational temperatures and sub-Doppler linewidths obtained in the slit supersonic expansion, the Ka = 0 \u2190 0 band of the symmetric CH stretch for CH2OH has been unambiguously identified and analyzed. By way of chemical confirmation, hydroxymethyl radical is generated via two different slit jet discharge syntheses: (i) direct dissociation of CH3OH to form CH2OH and (ii) dissociation of Cl2 followed by the radical H atom extraction reaction Cl + CH3OH \u2192 HCl + CH2OH. The identified transitions are fit to a Watson A-reduced symmetric top Hamiltonian to yield first precision experimental values for the ground state rotational constants as well as improved values for the symmetric stretch rotational constants and vibrational band origin. The results \u2026",
                "The high resolution infrared spectrum for the \u00c3 (2\u03a0) \u2190  (2\u03a3+) origin band of jet-cooled ethynyl radical (C2H) in the gas phase is reported, which exhibits a strong, parity-specific local perturbation in the upper 2\u03a01\/2 state. Based on revised parity assignments of the levels, the perturbing state is unambiguously determined to be 2\u03a3+ symmetry, and thus coupled to the \u00c3 (2\u03a0) state by \u0394K = \u00b11 Coriolis interactions. By incorporating \u03a3-\u03a0 Coriolis coupling into the unperturbed Hamiltonian (containing only rotational, spin-rotational, spin-orbit, and lambda-doubling contributions), we are now able to fit the observed 2\u03a0-2\u03a3+ origin band to a sub Doppler experimental uncertainty of 15 MHz (0.0005 cm\u22121). In addition, the observation of pairs of transitions to mixed states permits determination of the band origin (\u03bdpert) and rotational constant (Bpert) for the \u201cdark\u201d 2\u03a3+ state, which prove to be in remarkably quantitative agreement \u2026",
                "First high-resolution infrared absorption spectra in the fundamental symmetric\/asymmetric CH stretching region of isotopically substituted methyl radical, CH2D, are reported and analyzed. These studies become feasible in the difference frequency spectrometer due to (i) high density radical generation via dissociative electron attachment to CH2DI in a discharge, (ii) low rotational temperatures (23 K) from supersonic cooling in a slit expansion, (iii) long absorption path length (64 cm) along the slit axes, and (iv) near shot noise limited absorption sensitivity (5\u00d710\u22127\/ Hz ). The spectra are fully rovibrationally resolved and fit to an asymmetric top rotational Hamiltonian to yield rotational\/centrifugal constants and vibrational band origins. In addition, the slit expansion collisionally quenches the transverse velocity distribution along the laser probe direction, yielding sub-Doppler resolution of spin-rotation structure and even \u2026",
                "The combination of shot-noise-limited direct absorption spectroscopy with long-pathlength slit supersonic discharges has proven a powerful general method for obtaining infrared spectra of jet-cooled radicals at 10\u201320-fold sub-Doppler resolution. In addition to rovibrational characterization, such spectral resolution also provides a novel infrared window into fine (spin rotation) and hyperfine (Fermi contact, dipole\u2013dipole) structure in doublet asymmetric top radicals. This necessitates a detailed treatment of the rovibrational Hamiltonian to account for the inhomogeneous line contours generated by the manifold of transitions only partially resolved even under slit supersonic jet conditions. The present work describes least squares fitting these lineshapes with a detailed Hamiltonian predictor program that reflects contributions from (i) asymmetric top end over end tumbling (NK a K c), (ii) electron \u2026",
                "Hyperfine structure in the spectrum of the molecule rhenium monoxide (ReO) has been observed for the first time by recording the [14.0] 7\/2\u2013X 5\/2 (0,\u20090) band near 712\u2009nm at sub-Doppler resolution using intermodulated fluorescence spectroscopy. Hyperfine splittings due to both the 185Re and 187Re isotopes (I\u2009=\u20095\/2) have been resolved and assigned. A least-squares fit to the observed transitions has produced accurate values for the rotational, magnetic hyperfine and electric quadrupole constants for both electronic states. The hyperfine constants are discussed in relation to the electronic configurations of the two states. In particular, the ground state magnetic hyperfine constant is found to be consistent with a 1\u03c322\u03c321\u03c0 41\u03b433\u03c32 (X 2\u0394 i ) electronic configuration, where the 1\u03b4 orbital containing the unpaired electron is a Re 5d\u03b4 non-bonding orbital."

Ultrafast spectroscopy is used for real-time tracking of dynamics in quantum mechanical systems on the femtosecond (10-15s) timescale. We employ a newly-developed technique called Cavity-Enhanced Transient Absorption Spectroscopy to increase the sensitivity of ultrafast absorption spectroscopy. We use ultrafast fiber-laser frequency combs and couple them to external enhancement cavities to both increase the power and effective absorption pathlength, thus giving signal enhancements of several orders of magnitude over traditional transient absorption spectroscopy. This technique allows us to study samples in molecular beams on the femtosecond timescale with transient absorption spectroscopy. Before the development of this technique, ultrafast transient absorption was limited to concentrated condensed phase samples and study of gas phase samples generally required an indirect probe, such as measuring the energy of an ejected electron, or was limited to molecules and states that fluoresce. Now, not only can we now do the same experiment on condense phase molecules as gas phase molecules via transient absorption spectroscopy, we are able to directly probe the molecular states undergoing the dynamics we wish to study. We are currently building up the fiber lasers and cavity-enhanced transient absorption spectrometer with unique frequency tuning capabilities. We will combine this with a molecular beam source to create a relatively cold source of molecules and the ability to make clusters, radicals, and other designer molecules. One research direction will study the fundamentals of light-harvesting molecules, with a focus on the process of singlet fission, in which one absorbed photon becomes two excited electrons. Single fission is already starting to be used to increase the efficiency of solar cells, even though it is not well understood. We aim to look at model systems and understand the fundamental mechanisms of singlet fission. A second direction of research will be to study ultrafast dynamics of combustion radicals. Eventually we will make infrared light to look at ultrafast vibrational dynamics in a wide range of molecular systems. Cavity-Enhanced Transient Absorption Spectroscopy is widely applicable as an ultrafast technique since it requires nothing more than an absorbing state to probe any ultrafast dynamics. By combining a large wavelength tuning range, we can probe many systems from UV-vis photochemistry to ultrafast vibrational dynamics in the IR. With a molecular beam we can study not just stable compounds, but can make designer molecules (such as clusters) and short-lived molecules (such as radicals) and can study those as well. Additionally, the instrument is general enough to be able to do multidimensional spectroscopy with only a few small modifications. Selected Publications Selected Publications: X. L. Li,\u00a0M. A. R.
