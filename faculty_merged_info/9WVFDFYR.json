                "Long-term exposure to participate matter air pollution has been associated with increased cardiopulmonary mortality in the USA. We aimed to assess the relation between traffic-related air pollution and mortality in participants of the Netherlands Cohort study on Diet and Cancer (NLCS), an ongoing study.We investigated a random sample of 5000 people from the full cohort of the NLCS study (age 55\u201369 years) from 1986 to 1994. Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (black smoke and nitrogen dioxide) was estimated for the 1986 home address. Exposure was characterised with the measured regional and urban background concentration and an indicator variable for living near major roads. The association between exposure to air pollution and (cause specific) mortality was assessed with Cox's proportional hazards models, with adjustment for potential confounders.489 \u2026",
                "Ambient air pollution is suspected to cause lung cancer. We aimed to assess the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and lung cancer incidence in European populations.This prospective analysis of data obtained by the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects used data from 17 cohort studies based in nine European countries. Baseline addresses were geocoded and we assessed air pollution by land-use regression models for particulate matter (PM) with diameter of less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10), less than 2\u00b75 \u03bcm (PM2\u00b75), and between 2\u00b75 and 10 \u03bcm (PMcoarse), soot (PM2\u00b75absorbance), nitrogen oxides, and two traffic indicators. We used Cox regression models with adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and random effects models for meta-analyses.The 312\u2008944 cohort members contributed 4\u2008013\u2008131 person-years at \u2026",
                "Studies on the health effects of long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution have played an important role in recent health impact assessments. Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression (LUR) models. LUR models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of LUR models.We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20\u2013100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through \u2026",
                "Few studies on long-term exposure to air pollution and mortality have been reported from Europe. Within the multicentre European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), we aimed to investigate the association between natural-cause mortality and long-term exposure to several air pollutants.We used data from 22 European cohort studies, which created a total study population of 367\u2008251 participants. All cohorts were general population samples, although some were restricted to one sex only. With a strictly standardised protocol, we assessed residential exposure to air pollutants as annual average concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with diameters of less than 2\u00b75 \u03bcm (PM2\u00b75), less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10), and between 10 \u03bcm and 2\u00b75 \u03bcm (PMcoarse), PM2.5 absorbance, and annual average concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NOx), with land use regression models.

                "Despite the important contribution of traffic sources to urban air quality, relatively few studies have evaluated the effects of traffic-related air pollution on health, such as its influence on the development of asthma and other childhood respiratory diseases. We examined the relationship between traffic-related air pollution and the development of asthmatic\/allergic symptoms and respiratory infections in a birth cohort (n \u223c 4,000) study in The Netherlands. A validated model was used to assign outdoor concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter, and \u201csoot\u201d) at the home of each subject of the cohort. Questionnaire-derived data on wheezing, dry nighttime cough, ear, nose, and throat infections, skin rash, and physician-diagnosed asthma, bronchitis, influenza, and eczema at 2 years of age were analyzed in relation to air pollutants. Adjusted \u2026",
                "Background: Current air quality standards for particulate matter (PM) use the PM mass concentration [PM with aerodynamic diameters \u2264 10 \u03bcm (PM10) or \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5)] as a metric. It has been suggested that particles from combustion sources are more relevant to human health than are particles from other sources, but the impact of policies directed at reducing PM from combustion processes is usually relatively small when effects are estimated for a reduction in the total mass concentration.Objectives: We evaluated the value of black carbon particles (BCP) as an additional indicator in air quality management.Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of health effects of BCP compared with PM mass based on data from time-series studies and cohort studies that measured both exposures. We compared the potential health benefits of a hypothetical traffic abatement measure, using near \u2026",
                "As part of the EU-funded SAVIAH project, a regression-based methodology for mapping traffic-related air pollution was developed within a GIS environment. Mapping was carried out for NO2 in Amsterdam, Huddersfield and Prague. In each centre, surveys of NO2, as a marker for traffic-related pollution, were conducted using passive diffusion tubes, exposed for four 2-week periods. A GIS was also established, containing data on monitored air pollution levels, road network, traffic volume, land cover, altitude and other, locally determined, features. Data from 80 of the monitoring sites were then used to construct a regression equation, on the basis of predictor environmental variables, and the resulting equation used to map air pollution across the study area. The accuracy of the map was then assessed by comparing predicted pollution levels with monitored levels at a range of independent reference sites. Results \u2026",
                "Land Use Regression (LUR) models have been used increasingly for modeling small-scale spatial variation in air pollution concentrations and estimating individual exposure for participants of cohort studies. Within the ESCAPE project, concentrations of PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, PM10, and PMcoarse were measured in 20 European study areas at 20 sites per area. GIS-derived predictor variables (e.g., traffic intensity, population, and land-use) were evaluated to model spatial variation of annual average concentrations for each study area. The median model explained variance (R2) was 71% for PM2.5 (range across study areas 35\u201394%). Model R2 was higher for PM2.5 absorbance (median 89%, range 56\u201397%) and lower for PMcoarse (median 68%, range 32\u2013 81%). Models included between two and five predictor variables, with various traffic indicators as the most common predictors. Lower R2 was related to \u2026",
                "Several studies have found an effect on mortality of between-city contrasts in long-term exposure to air pollution. The effect of within-city contrasts is still poorly understood.We studied the association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and mortality in a Dutch cohort.We used data from an ongoing cohort study on diet and cancer with 120,852 subjects who were followed from 1987 to 1996. Exposure to black smoke (BS), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter \u2264mu;M2.5), as well as various exposure variables related to traffic, were estimated at the home address. We conducted Cox analyses in the full cohort adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and area-level socioeconomic status.Traffic intensity on the nearest road was independently associated with mortality.
