                "We report the confinement and cooling of an optically dense cloud of neutral sodium atoms by radiation pressure. The trapping and damping forces were provided by three retroreflected laser beams propagating along orthogonal axes, with a weak magnetic field used to distinguish between the beams. We have trapped as many as 10 7 atoms for 2 min at densities exceeding 10 11 atoms cm\u2212 3. The trap was\u2243 0.4 K deep and the atoms, once trapped, were cooled to less than a millikelvin and compacted into a region less than 0.5 mm in diameter.",
                "Interference with atomic and molecular matter waves is a rich branch of atomic physics and quantum optics. It started with atom diffraction from crystal surfaces and the separated oscillatory fields technique used in atomic clocks. Atom interferometry is now reaching maturity as a powerful art with many applications in modern science. In this review the basic tools for coherent atom optics are described including diffraction by nanostructures and laser light, three-grating interferometers, and double wells on atom chips. Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories:(i) fundamental quantum science,(ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics. Although some experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates are included, the focus of the review is on linear matter wave optics, ie, phenomena \u2026",
                "\u201cCircuits and Electronics\u201d(6.002 x), which began in March 2012, was the first MOOC developed by edX, the consortium led by MIT and Harvard. Over 155,000 students initially registered for 6.002 x, which was composed of video lectures, interactive problems, online laboratories, and a discussion forum. As the course ended in June 2012, researchers began to analyze the rich sources of data it generated. This article describes both the first stage of this research, which examined the students\u2019 use of resources by time spent on each, and a second stage that is producing an in-depth picture of who the 6.002 x students were, how their own background and capabilities related to their achievement and persistence, and how their interactions with 6.002 x\u2019s curricular and pedagogical components contributed to their level of success in the course.",
                "Properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate were studied by stimulated, two-photon Bragg scattering. The high momentum and energy resolution of this method allowed a spectroscopic measurement of the mean-field energy and of the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of the condensate. The coherence length of the condensate was shown to be equal to its size. Bragg spectroscopy can be used to determine the dynamic structure factor over a wide range of energy and momentum transfers.",
                "A new magneto-optical trap is demonstrated which confines atoms predominantly in a \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019hyperfine level, that does not interact with the trapping light. This leads to much higher atomic densities as repulsive forces between atoms due to rescattered radiation are reduced and trap loss due to excited-state collisions is diminished. In such a trap, more than 10 10 sodium atoms have been confined to densities approaching 10 12 atoms cm\u2212 3.",
                "We have demonstrated an interferometer for atoms. A three-grating geometry is used, in which the interfering beams are distinctly separated in both position and momentum. We used a highly collimated beam of sodium atoms with a de Broglie wavelength of 16 pm and high-quality 0.4-\u03bcm-period free-standing gratings which we fabricated using a novel method. The interference signal is 70 counts\/s, which allows us to determine the phase to 0.1 rad in 1 min. Applications of atom interferometers are briefly discussed.",
                "A configuration of magnetic fields is exhibited which can harmonically trap paramagnetic particles in a shallow field minimum, superposed on a nearly uniform field which simplifies spectroscopic interactions with the particles. The potential energy of a trapped neutral particle depends on the particle's internal quantum number, as well as its position in the trap, permitting a combined rf-laser optical pumping cycle which can cool particles by a factor of 2 per cycle. Application of these ideas to the trapping of Na atoms is discussed.",
                "We present theoretical results for the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation, condensate fraction, and heat capacity of a gas of Bose particles that are confined by a generic power-law potential trap. All three of these quantities are found to vary markedly with the shape of the potential. Both the ideal and the weakly interacting Bose gas are considered.",
                "Rayleigh scattering off a Bose-Einstein condensate was studied. Exposing an elongated condensate to a single off-resonant laser beam resulted in the observation of highly directional scattering of light and atoms. This collective light scattering is caused by the coherent center-of-mass motion of the atoms in the condensate. A directional beam of recoiling atoms was built up by matter wave amplification.",
                "A trapped-atom interferometer was demonstrated using gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates coherently split by deforming an optical single-well potential into a double-well potential. The relative phase between the two condensates was determined from the spatial phase of the matter wave interference pattern formed upon releasing the condensates from the separated potential wells. Coherent phase evolution was observed for condensates held separated by 13 \u03bc m for up to 5 ms and was controlled by applying ac Stark shift potentials to either of the two separated condensates."

Welch (617) 253-6830 RELATED LINKS: Precise Mass Spectrometry Group (ICR) MIT - Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics MIT Atom Interferometer Group RELATE - Education Research Group of Professor David Pritchard \"Bose-Einstein Condensation: A Double Pot of Gold\" [PDF] ( , Fall 2002) Atomic Physics Professor David E. Pritchard is a principal investigator in the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Group and works on Basic Atomic Physics in the Research Laboratory of Electronics. Professor Pritchard carried out pioneering experiments on the interaction of atoms with light that led to the creation of the field of atom optics. His demonstration of the diffraction of a beam of atoms by a grating made of light waves opened the way to studies of the diffraction, reflection, and focusing of matter waves, similar to those with light waves. He has applied atom optics to basic studies of quantum theory, to new methods for studying the properties of atoms, and to the creation of devices such as the atom interferometer and atom wave gyroscope. Professor Pritchard's investigations in atom-light interactions also led him into the field of laser cooling where he made a number of pioneering contributions, including the work that led to the creation of the magneto-optical trap. This device became the workhorse in atom cooling experiments, including most studies of Bose-Einstein condensation. In 1990, he brought Wolfgang Ketterle to MIT as a postdoctoral researcher to work on atom cooling, and stepped aside from that field to allow Ketterle to be appointed to the faculty in 1992. Ketterle pursued atom cooling to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation in 1995, a discovery for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2001, along with Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman of JILA, Boulder, CO. Professor Pritchard also mentored Eric Cornell, who was his graduate student. Professor Pritchard is currently collaborating with Ketterle to merge Bose-Einstein condensation with atom optics, using the atom laser as a source of coherent atoms for basic studies in quantum physics, new types of atom interferometry, and possibly to applications in nanotechnology and quantum computing. Professor Pritchard is also a dedicated teacher. During the past few years he has developed a computer-based tutorial for elementary mechanics called Cybertutor , which has been used successfully in versions of 8.01: Physics I . Professor Pritchard received his B.S. from California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. from Harvard, working with Professor Daniel Kleppner, who soon thereafter came to MIT, bringing Pritchard with him as a postdoctoral fellow. Pritchard joined the faculty of the Department of Physics in 1970. He has many honors, including the Broida Prize of the American Physical Society. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. D. Pritchard, TechEd99 , ed. A. Ellis (1999).
