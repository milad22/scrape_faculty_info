                "Numerous lines of evidence challenge the traditional interpretations of how crystals nucleate and grow in synthetic and natural systems. In contrast to the monomer-by-monomer addition described in classical models, crystallization by addition of particles, ranging from multi-ion complexes to fully formed nanocrystals, is now recognized as a common phenomenon. This diverse set of pathways results from the complexity of both the free-energy landscapes and the reaction dynamics that govern particle formation and interaction.Whereas experimental observations clearly demonstrate crystallization by particle attachment (CPA), many fundamental aspects remain unknown\u2014particularly the interplay of solution structure, interfacial forces, and particle motion. Thus, a predictive description that connects molecular details to ensemble behavior is lacking. As that description develops, long-standing \u2026",
                "The sensitivity of Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene) excitation and emission spectra to the physical state of the membrane arises from dipolar relaxation processes in the membrane region surrounding the Laurdan molecule. Experiments performed using phospholipid vesicles composed of phospholipids with different polar head groups show that this part of the molecule is not responsible for the observed effects. Also, pH titration in the range from pH 4 to 10 shows that the spectral variations are independent of the charge of the polar head. A two-state model of dipolar relaxation is used to qualitatively explain the behavior of Laurdan. It is concluded that the presence of water molecules in the phospholipid matrix are responsible for the spectral properties of Laurdan in the gel phase. In the liquid crystalline phase there is a relaxation process that we attribute to water molecules that can reorientate \u2026",
                "The organization of lipids surrounding membrane proteins can influence their properties. We have used 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Laurdan) to study phase coexistence and phase interconversion in membrane model systems. The fluorescence properties of Laurdan provide a unique possibility to study lipid domains because of the different excitation and emission spectra of this probe in the gel and in the liquid-crystalline phase. The difference in excitation spectra allows photoselection of Laurdan molecules in one of the two phases. Using the difference in emission spectra it is then possible to observe interconversion between the two phases. We have performed experiments in dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles at different temperatures, in particular in the region of the phase transition, where phase coexistence and interconversion between phases is likely to be maximal. We have \u2026",
                "Abundant, micrometer-scale, spherical aggregates of 2- to 5-nanometer-diameter sphalerite (ZnS) particles formed within natural biofilms dominated by relatively aerotolerant sulfate-reducing bacteria of the family Desulfobacteriaceae. The biofilm zinc concentration is about 106 times that of associated groundwater (0.09 to 1.1 parts per million zinc). Sphalerite also concentrates arsenic (0.01 weight %) and selenium (0.004 weight %). The almost monomineralic product results from buffering of sulfide concentrations at low values by sphalerite precipitation. These results show how microbes control metal concentrations in groundwater- and wetland-based remediation systems and suggest biological routes for formation of some low-temperature ZnS deposits.",
                "Biological systems can produce extraordinary inorganic structures and morphologies. The mechanisms of synthesis are poorly understood but are of great interest for engineering novel materials. We use spectromicroscopy to show that microbially generated submicrometer-diameter iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) filaments contain polysaccharides, providing an explanation for the formation of akaganeite pseudo\u2013single crystals with aspect ratios of \u223c1000:1. We infer that the cells extrude the polysaccharide strands to localize FeOOH precipitation in proximity to the cell membrane to harness the proton gradient for energy generation. Characterization of organic compounds with high spatial resolution, correlated with mineralogical information, should improve our understanding of biomineralization mechanisms.",
                "Sea urchin larval spicules transform amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) into calcite single crystals. The mechanism of transformation is enigmatic: the transforming spicule displays both amorphous and crystalline properties, with no defined crystallization front. Here, we use X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy with probing size of 40\u2013200 nm. We resolve 3 distinct mineral phases: An initial short-lived, presumably hydrated ACC phase, followed by an intermediate transient form of ACC, and finally the biogenic crystalline calcite phase. The amorphous and crystalline phases are juxtaposed, often appearing in adjacent sites at a scale of tens of nanometers. We propose that the amorphous-crystal transformation propagates in a tortuous path through preexisting 40- to 100-nm amorphous units, via a secondary nucleation mechanism.",
                "Enamel, the hardest tissue in the body, begins as a three-dimensional network of nanometer size mineral particles, suspended in a protein gel. This mineral network serves as a template for mature enamel formation. To further understand the mechanisms of enamel formation we characterized the forming enamel mineral at an early secretory stage using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectromicroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), FTIR microspectroscopy and polarized light microscopy. We show that the newly formed enamel mineral is amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), which eventually transforms into apatitic crystals. Interestingly, the size, shape and spatial organization of these amorphous mineral particles and older crystals are essentially the same, indicating that the mineral morphology and organization in enamel is determined prior to its crystallization.

                "Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a metastable phase often observed during low temperature inorganic synthesis and biomineralization. ACC transforms with aging or heating into a less hydrated form, and with time crystallizes to calcite or aragonite. The energetics of transformation and crystallization of synthetic and biogenic (extracted from California purple sea urchin larval spicules, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) ACC were studied using isothermal acid solution calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Transformation and crystallization of ACC can follow an energetically downhill sequence: more metastable hydrated ACC \u2192 less metastable hydrated ACC\u21d2anhydrous ACC \u223c biogenic anhydrous ACC\u21d2vaterite \u2192 aragonite \u2192 calcite. In a given reaction sequence, not all these phases need to occur. The transformations involve a series of ordering, dehydration, and crystallization processes, each \u2026",
                "We present near edge X-ray absorption spectra of manganese oxides at the Mn L2,3, Mn K, and O K edges to investigate the relative sensitivity of the edges to bonding and structure. Collectively, the spectra probe local electronic structure and intermediate range crystal structure. Spin independent full multiple scattering calculations of the Mn K edge give good agreement with data above threshold and qualitatively reproduce the prepeak that is observed for each compound. We show that the apparent prepeak for MnO is not due to p\u2212d hybridization at the Mn atom (in accordance with symmetry principles) or quadrupolar transitions but originates from multiple scattering within the fifth shell. We present spin dependent multiple scattering calculations of the O K edge and show that this edge allows for a more direct description of the 3d states than either the Mn L edge or K edge prepeak, which are complicated by \u2026",
                "Crystalline biominerals do not resemble faceted crystals. Current explanations for this property involve formation via amorphous phases. Using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM), here we examine forming spicules in embryos of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchins, and observe a sequence of three mineral phases: hydrated amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC\u00b7H2O) \u2192 dehydrated amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) \u2192 calcite. Unexpectedly, we find ACC\u00b7H2O-rich nanoparticles that persist after the surrounding mineral has dehydrated and crystallized. Protein matrix components occluded within the mineral must inhibit ACC\u00b7H2O dehydration. We devised an in vitro, also using XANES-PEEM, assay to identify spicule proteins that may play a role in stabilizing various mineral phases, and found that the most abundant occluded matrix \u2026"
