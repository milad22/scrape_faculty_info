Teaching Dr. Mannella has taught the following courses: Physics 231 and Physics 232: Fundamentals of Physics: Waves, Optics and Modern Physics Physics 311: Classical Mechanics Physics 431: Electricity and Magnetism I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics in September 2003 from UC Davis (CA) with Prof. C. S. Fadley. Immediately after, I became a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University (CA) with Prof. Z. X. Shen, with a joint appointment as a Visiting Scientist at the Advance Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley (CA) in the User Support System Group of Dr. Z. Hussain.  In October 2006, I obtained a joint position as Research Associate at Stanford University in Prof. Z. X. Shen's group and Beamline Scientist at the ALS in the User Support System Group of Dr. Z. Hussain.  I became an Assistant Professor in the Physics Department at UTK in August 2007.  For a full CV, including full publications record, go here For Prospective Students and Post-Doctoral Fellows Our group is composed of two postdoctoral researchers (Dr. Cheney and Dr. Vilmercati) as well as students.  A couple of positions are immediately available for highly motivated graduate students who are interested in the study of novel materials and complex electron systems with soft x-ray spectroscopies.  If interested, please e-mail ( nmannell@utk.edu ) or call me in the office (4-6123).  A description of our research activities and ongoing projects may be found here .
