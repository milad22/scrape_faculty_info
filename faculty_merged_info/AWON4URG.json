                "An all\u2010oxide transparent resistive random access memory (T\u2010RRAM) device based on hafnium oxide (HfOx) storage layer and indium\u2010tin oxide (ITO) electrodes is fabricated in this work. The memory device demonstrates not only good optical transmittance but also a forming\u2010free bipolar resistive switching behavior with room\u2010temperature ROFF\/RON ratio of 45, excellent endurance of \u22485 \u00d7 107 cycles and long retention time over 106 s. More importantly, the HfOx based RRAM carries great ability of anti\u2010thermal shock over a wide temperature range of 10 K to 490 K, and the high ROFF\/RON ratio of \u224840 can be well maintained under extreme working conditions. The field\u2010induced electrochemical formation and rupture of the robust metal\u2010rich conductive filaments in the mixed\u2010structure hafnium oxide film are found to be responsible for the excellent resistance switching of the T\u2010RRAM devices. The present all\u2010oxide \u2026",
                "A multifunctional optoelectronic resistive switching memory, composed of a simple ITO\/CeO 2\u2212 x\/AlO y\/Al structure, is demonstrated. Arising from the photoinduced detrapping, electrode\u2010injection and retrapping of electrons in the CeO 2\u2212 x\/AlO y\/Al interfacial region, the device shows broadband, linear, and persistent photoresponses that can be used for the integration of demodulating, arithmetic, and memory functions in a single device for future optoelectronic interconnect systems.",
                "Memristive devices are able to store and process information, which offers several key advantages over the transistor-based architectures. However, most of the two-terminal memristive devices have fixed functions once made and cannot be reconfigured for other situations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a memristive device \u201cmemlogic\u201d (memory logic) as a nonvolatile switch of logic operations integrated with memory function in a single light-gated memristor. Based on nonvolatile light-modulated memristive switching behavior, a single memlogic cell is able to achieve optical and electrical mixed basic Boolean logic of reconfigurable \u201cAND\u201d, \u201cOR\u201d, and \u201cNOT\u201d operations. Furthermore, the single memlogic cell is also capable of functioning as an optical adder and digital-to-analog converter. All the memlogic outputs are memristive for in situ data storage due to the nonvolatile resistive switching and persistent \u2026",
                "Thermally stable poly(triphenylamine) (PTPA) synthesized by an oxidative coupling reaction is used as the functional layer in memory devices, which exhibit non-volatile bistable resistive switching behavior with a large ON\/OFF ratio over 5 \u00d7 108, a long retention time exceeding 8 \u00d7 103 s and a wide working temperature range of 30\u2013390 K.",
                "In this study, an artificial synapse with a sandwich structure of Ta\/ethyl viologen diperchlorate [EV(ClO4)2]\/triphenylamine-based polyimide (TPA-PI)\/Pt is fabricated directly on a flexible PET substrate and exhibits distinctive history-dependent memristive behaviour, which meets the basic requirements for synapse emulation. Essential synaptic plasticity (including long-term plasticity and short-term plasticity) and some memory and learning behaviours of human beings (including the conversion from short-term memory to long-term memory and the \u201clearning\u2013forgetting\u2013relearning\u201d) have been demonstrated in our device. More importantly, the device still exhibits the synaptic performance when the surface strain of the device reaches 0.64% (or, the bending radius reaches 10 mm). Moreover, the device was able to endure 100 bending cycles. Our findings strongly demonstrate that the organic artificial synapse is not only \u2026",
                "Nanoscale manipulation of materials' physicochemical properties offers distinguished possibility to the development of novel electronic devices with ultrasmall dimension, fast operation speed, and low energy consumption characteristics. This is especially important as the present semiconductor manufacturing technique is approaching the end of miniaturization campaign in the near future. Here, a superior metal\u2013insulator transition (MIT) of a 1D VO2 nanochannel constructed through an electric\u2010field\u2010induced oxygen ion migration process in V2O5 thin film is reported for the first time. A sharp and reliable MIT transition with a steep turn\u2010on voltage slope of <0.5 mV dec\u22121, fast switching speed of 17 ns, low energy consumption of 8 pJ, and low variability of <4.3% is demonstrated in the VO2 nanochannel device. High\u2010resolution transmission electron microscopy observation and theoretical computation verify that the \u2026",
                "Exploring the role of electrode metals on the resistive switching properties of metal electrode\/oxide\/metal electrode sandwiched structures provides not only essential information to understand the underlying switching mechanism of the devices, but also useful guidelines for the optimization of the switching performance. A systematic study has been performed to investigate the influence of electrodes on the resistive switching characteristics of zinc oxide (ZnO) films in this contribution, in terms of both the intrinsic and interfacial effects. It has been found that the low-resistance state resistances (\u03a9 LRS) of all the investigated devices are below 50 \u03a9, which can be attributed to the formation of highly conductive channels throughout the ZnO films. On the other hand, the high-resistance state resistances (\u03a9 HRS) depend on the electronegativity and ionic size of the employed electrode metals. Devices with electrode metals \u2026",
                "Energy efficiency, parallel information processing, and unsupervised learning make the human brain a model computing system for unstructured data handling. Different types of oxide memristors can emulate synaptic functions in artificial neuromorphic circuits. However, their cycle\u2010to\u2010cycle variability or strict epitaxy requirements remain a challenge for applications in large\u2010scale neural networks. Here, solution\u2010processable ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) with P(VDF\u2010TrFE) copolymer barriers are reported showing analog memristive behavior with a broad range of accessible conductance states and low energy dissipation of 100 fJ for the onset of depression and 1 pJ for the onset of potentiation by resetting small tunneling currents on nanosecond timescales. Key synaptic functions like programmable synaptic weight, long\u2010 and short\u2010term potentiation and depression, paired\u2010pulse facilitation and depression \u2026",
                "Two donor\u2013acceptor (D\u2013A) polyazothines (PAs), incorporating the oxadiazole entity either acting as an electron acceptor (A) to form D\u2013A structured PA-1 with the triphenylamine donor (D), or acting as a donor to form D\u2013A structured PA-2 with the 3,3\u2032-dinitro-diphenylsulfone acceptor, have been successfully synthesized via a polycondensation reaction. The variation in the role of the oxadiazole moiety in the D\u2013A polymers, together with the use of different top electrode metals, leads to interesting electronic transport properties and various resistive switching behaviors of the present polyazothines. Pt-electrode devices based on a PA-1 active layer show a rewritable memory effect with poor endurance (less than 20 cycles), whereas the PA-2 based Pt devices exhibit write-once read-many-times (WORM) memory behavior. For the Al-electrode devices, both PAs demonstrate a much improved resistive switching effect \u2026",
