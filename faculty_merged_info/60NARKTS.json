Letts. 96,105302:1-4 (2006) Quantum Information Science Condensed Matter Theory Illinois Physics researchers awarded DOE grants to advance quantum information science Physics Professors Bryan Clark and Taylor Hughes of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have been awarded US Department of Energy (DOE) grants to develop new quantum computing capabilities. The awards are part of a $37-million DOE initiative supporting research that will lay the groundwork for the development of new quantum information systems and that will use current quantum information capabilities to advance research in material and chemical sciences. Quantum information science (QIS) is an exciting and rapidly growing field promising a broad range of advances beyond today\u2019s classical technologies. QIS exploits quantum mechanics\u2014the theory that explains nature at all scales, from electrons, to atoms, to neutron stars\u2014as a platform for information processing, data storage, and secure communications. Quantum computers will use qubits, non-binary bits capable of hosting near limitless quantum states to process and store data, while quantum communications will leverage quantum mechanical properties such as entanglement to generate unhackable encryption. Condensed Matter Condensed Matter Theory New algorithm could help find new physics Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have developed an algorithm that could provide meaningful answers to condensed matter physicists in their searches for novel and emergent properties in materials. The algorithm, invented by physics professor Bryan Clark and his graduate student Eli Chertkov, inverts the typical mathematical process condensed matter physicists use to search for interesting physics. Their new method starts with the answer\u2014what kinds of physical properties would be interesting to find\u2014and works backward to the question\u2014what class of materials would host such properties."
