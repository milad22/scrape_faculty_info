                "The CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) is used to study photo-and electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions by providing efficient detection of neutral and charged particles over a good fraction of the full solid angle. A collaboration of about 30 institutions has designed, assembled, and commissioned CLAS in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The CLAS detector is based on a novel six-coil toroidal magnet which provides a largely azimuthal field distribution. Trajectory reconstruction using drift chambers results in a momentum resolution of 0.5% at forward angles. Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters provide good particle identification. Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of 10 34 nucleon cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. These capabilities are being used in a broad experimental program to study the \u2026",
                "In an exclusive measurement of the reaction \u03b3 d\u2192 K+ K\u2212 p n, a narrow peak that can be attributed to an exotic baryon with strangeness S=+ 1 is seen in the K+ n invariant mass spectrum. The peak is at 1.542\u00b10.005 G e V\/c 2 with a measured width of 0.021 G e V\/c 2 FWHM, which is largely determined by experimental mass resolution. The statistical significance of the peak is (5.2\u00b10.6) \u03c3. The mass and width of the observed peak are consistent with recent reports of a narrow S=+ 1 baryon by other experimental groups.",
                "The instrumentation in Hall A at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility was designed to study electro-and photo-induced reactions at very high luminosity and good momentum and angular resolution for at least one of the reaction products. The central components of Hall A are two identical high resolution spectrometers, which allow the vertical drift chambers in the focal plane to provide a momentum resolution of better than 2\u00d7 10\u2212 4. A variety of Cherenkov counters, scintillators and lead-glass calorimeters provide excellent particle identification. The facility has been operated successfully at a luminosity well in excess of 10 38 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. The research program is aimed at a variety of subjects, including nucleon structure functions, nucleon form factors and properties of the nuclear medium.",
                "We report the first results of the beam-spin asymmetry measured in the reaction e\u2192 p\u2192 ep \u03b3 at a beam energy of 4.25 GeV. A large asymmetry with a sin \u03c6 modulation is observed, as predicted for the interference term of deeply virtual compton scattering (DVCS) and the Bethe-Heitler process. The amplitude of this modulation is \u03b1= 0.202\u00b10.028. In leading-order and leading-twist perturbative QCD, the \u03b1 is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the DVCS amplitude.",
                "The reaction \u03b3 p\u2192 \u03c0+ K\u2212 K+ n was studied at Jefferson Laboratory using a tagged photon beam with an energy range of 3\u20135.47 GeV. A narrow baryon state with strangeness S=+ 1 and mass M= 1555\u00b110 M e V\/c 2 was observed in the n K+ invariant mass spectrum. The peak\u2019s width is consistent with the CLAS resolution (F W H M= 26 M e V\/c 2), and its statistical significance is (7.8\u00b11.0) \u03c3. A baryon with positive strangeness has exotic structure and cannot be described in the framework of the naive constituent quark model. The mass of the observed state is consistent with the mass predicted by the chiral soliton model for the \u0398+ baryon. In addition, the p K+ invariant mass distribution was analyzed in the reaction \u03b3 p\u2192 K\u2212 K+ p with high statistics in search of doubly charged exotic baryon states. No resonance structures were found in this spectrum.",
                "High-statistics cross sections for the reactions \u03b3+ p\u2192 K++ \u039b and \u03b3+ p\u2192 K++ \u03a3 0 have been measured using CLAS at Jefferson Lab for center-of-mass energies W between 1.6 and 2.53 GeV, and for\u2212 0.85< cos \u03b8 K+ c. m.<+ 0.95. In the K+ \u039b channel we confirm a resonance-like structure near W= 1.9 GeV at backward kaon angles. The position and width of this structure change with angle, indicating that more than one resonance is likely playing a role. The K+ \u039b channel at forward angles and all energies is well described by a t-channel scaling characteristic of Regge exchange, whereas the same scaling applied to the K+ \u03a3 0 channel is less successful. Several existing theoretical models are compared to the data, but none provide a good representation of the results.",
                "The ratios of inclusive electron scattering cross sections of He 4, C 12, and Fe 56 to He 3 have been measured at 1< x B< 3. At Q 2> 1.4 GeV 2, the ratios exhibit two separate plateaus, at 1.5< x B< 2 and at x B> 2.25. This pattern is predicted by models that include 2-and 3-nucleon short-range correlations (SRC). Relative to A= 3, the per-nucleon probabilities of 3-nucleon SRC are 2.3, 3.1, and 4.4 times larger for A= 4, 12, and 56. This is the first measurement of 3-nucleon SRC probabilities in nuclei.",
                "Models of baryon structure predict a small quadrupole deformation of the nucleon due to residual tensor forces between quarks or distortions from the pion cloud. Sensitivity to quark versus pion degrees of freedom occurs through the Q 2 dependence of the magnetic (M 1+), electric (E 1+), and scalar (S 1+) multipoles in the \u03b3* p\u2192 \u0394+\u2192 p \u03c0 0 transition. We report new experimental values for the ratios E 1+\/M 1+ and S 1+\/M 1+ over the range Q 2= 0.4\u20131.8 GeV 2, extracted from precision p (e, e\u2032 p) \u03c0 0 data using a truncated multipole expansion. Results are best described by recent unitary models in which the pion cloud plays a dominant role.",
                "We have measured the parity-violating electroweak asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from protons. Significant contributions to this asymmetry could arise from the contributions of strange form factors in the nucleon. The measured asymmetry is A=\u2212 15.05\u00b10.98 (stat)\u00b10.56 (syst) ppm at the kinematic point\u27e8 \u03b8 lab\u27e9= 12.3 and\u27e8 Q 2\u27e9= 0.477 (GeV\u2215 c) 2. Based on these data as well as data on electromagnetic form factors, we extract the linear combination of strange form factors G E s+ 0.392 G M s= 0.014\u00b10.020\u00b10.010, where the first error arises from this experiment and the second arises from the electromagnetic form factor data. This paper provides a full description of the special experimental techniques employed for precisely measuring the small asymmetry, including the first use of a strained GaAs crystal and a laser-Compton polarimeter in a fixed target parity-violation experiment.",
                "We have measured the parity-violating electroweak asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from the proton. The kinematic point [< \u03b8 lab>= 12.3 and< Q 2>= 0.48 (GeV\/c) 2] is chosen to provide sensitivity, at a level that is of theoretical interest, to the strange electric form factor G E s. The result, A=\u2212 14.5\u00b12.2 ppm, is consistent with the electroweak standard model and no additional contributions from strange quarks. In particular, the measurement implies G E s+ 0.39 G M s= 0.023\u00b10.034 (stat)\u00b10.022 (syst)\u00b10.026 (\u03b4 G E n), where the last uncertainty arises from the estimated uncertainty in the neutron electric form factor."
