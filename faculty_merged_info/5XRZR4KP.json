                "Kisspeptin and its receptor GPR54 have recently been identified as key signaling partners in the neural control of fertility in animal models and humans. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent the final output neurons of the neural network controlling fertility and are suspected to be the primary locus of kisspeptin\u2013GPR54 signaling. Using mouse models, the present study addressed whether kisspeptin and GPR54 have a key role in the activation of GnRH neurons to generate the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge responsible for ovulation. Dual-label immunocytochemistry experiments showed that 40\u201360% of kisspeptin neurons in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) expressed estrogen receptor \u03b1 and progesterone receptors. Using an ovariectomized, gonadal steroid-replacement regimen, which reliably generates an LH surge, \u223c30% of RP3V kisspeptin neurons were \u2026",
                "Molecular cloning of cockroach allergens and their expression as recombinant proteins have allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms of cockroach allergic disease. Recombinant cockroach allergens have been used for skin testing or in vitro methods to measure IgE antibody levels in serum. Early studies evaluating selected U.S. patients revealed that a cocktail of four cockroach allergens, Bla g 1, Bla g 2, Bla g 4, and Bla g 5, would identify 95 % of cockroach allergic patients. More recent studies pointed to an important role of sensitization to tropomyosin among certain populations, and suggested that a cocktail of five allergens Bla g 1 and\/or Per a 1, Bla g 2, Bla g 4, Bla g 5, and Bla g 7, and\/or Per a 7, would be expected to diagnose 50\u2013 64 % of cockroach-allergic patients worldwide. Variation in IgE reactivity profiles could be in part due to IgE responses to cross-reactive homologous allergens \u2026",

A single nucleotide deletion at the C1 inhibitor gene as the cause of hereditary angioedema: insights from a Brazilian family.Allergy 2011; 66: 1384\u20131390.Background:\u2002 Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by episodes of subcutaneous and submucosal edema. It is caused by deficiency of the C1 inhibitor protein, leading to elevated levels of bradykinin. More than 200 mutations in C1 inhibitor gene have been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical features of a large family with an index case of hereditary angioedema and to determine the disease\u2010causing mutation in this family.Methods:\u2002 Family pedigree was constructed with 275 individuals distributed in five generations. One hundred and sixty\u2010five subjects were \u2026",

Mutations in the F12 gene have been identified in subsets of patients with HAE with normal C1-INH, mostly within families of European descent.Our aim was to describe clinical characteristics observed in Brazilians from 42 families with HAE and F12 gene mutations (FXII-HAE), and to compare these findings with those from other populations.We evaluated a group of 195 individuals, which included 102 patients clinically diagnosed with FXII-HAE and their 93 asymptomatic relatives.Genetic analysis revealed that of the 195 subjects, 134 individuals (77.6% females) carried a pathogenic mutation in F12. The T328K substitution was found in 132 individuals, and the c.971_1018+24del72 deletion was found in 2 patients. The \u2026",
                "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 25% of children and 10% of adults. The skin of patients with moderate to severe AD is characterized by significant barrier disruption and T helper 2 (Th2)-driven inflammation, which are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Current management of AD is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory response and restoring the barrier function of the skin, reducing exacerbations, and preventing secondary skin infections. Combinations of treatment strategies are used to alleviate the symptoms of the disease; however, resolution is often temporary, and long-term usage of some of the medications for AD can be associated with significant side effects. Antibody therapies previously approved for other inflammatory diseases have been evaluated in patients with AD. Unfortunately, they have often failed to result in significant clinical \u2026",

                "Several substances work as neuromediators of the estrogen direct and indirect (throught glial cells or interneurons) action on luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone (LH-RH) neurons in medial basal hypothalamus and medial preoptic area (MPOA).Angiotensin II (AII) in the MPOA stimulates the LH and it inhibits PRL secretion in some situations. On the other hand, the effect of excitatory aminoacids on LH and PRL surges during proestrus as well LH surge induced by steroids depend on nitric oxide (NO). In the present study we investigated the participation of MPOA endogenous NO on gonadotropin and PRL secretion mediated by estrogen and AII. Plasma LH, FSH and PRL was determinated in estrogen primed and unprimed ovariectomized Wistar rats that received microinjection of AII or saline into the MPOA, associated or not with a previous microinjection of an inhibitor for NOS.

                "Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent angioedema attacks with the involvement of multiple organs. The disease is unknown to many health professionals and is therefore underdiagnosed. Patients who are not adequately diagnosed and treated have an estimated mortality rate ranging from 25% to 40% due to asphyxiation by laryngeal angioedema. Intestinal angioedema is another important and incapacitating presentation that may be the main or only manifestation during an attack.
