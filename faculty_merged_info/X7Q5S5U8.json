                "We have observed Bose-Einstein condensation of molecules. When a spin mixture of fermionic L i 6 atoms was evaporatively cooled in an optical dipole trap near a Feshbach resonance, the atomic gas was converted into L i 2 6 molecules. Below 600 nK, a Bose-Einstein condensate of up to 900 000 molecules was identified by the sudden onset of a bimodal density distribution. This condensate realizes the limit of tightly bound fermion pairs in the crossover between BCS superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation.",
                "Bose-Einstein condensates of sodium atoms have been prepared in optical and magnetic traps in which the energy-level spacing in one or two dimensions exceeds the interaction energy between atoms, realizing condensates of lower dimensionality. The crossover into two-dimensional and one-dimensional condensates was observed by a change in aspect ratio and by the release energy converging to a nonzero value when the number of trapped atoms was reduced.",
                "We have produced a macroscopic quantum system in which a 6 Li Fermi sea coexists with a large and stable 23 Na Bose-Einstein condensate. This was accomplished using interspecies sympathetic cooling of fermionic 6 Li in a thermal bath of bosonic 23 Na. The system features rapid thermalization and long lifetimes.",
                "Stimulated small-angle light scattering was used to measure the structure factor of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the phonon regime. The excitation strength for phonons was found to be significantly reduced from that of free particles, revealing the presence of correlated pair excitations and quantum depletion in the condensate. The Bragg resonance line strength and line shift agreed with predictions for the homogeneous Bose gas using a local density approximation.",
                "Current research on micromechanical resonators strives for quantum-limited detection of the motion of macroscopic objects. Prerequisite to this goal is the observation of measurement backaction consistent with quantum metrology limits. However, thermal noise currently dominates measurements and precludes ground-state preparation of the resonator. Here, we establish the collective motion of an ultracold atomic gas confined tightly within a Fabry\u2013Perot optical cavity as a system for investigating the quantum mechanics of macroscopic bodies. The cavity-mode structure selects a particular collective vibrational motion that is measured by the cavity\u2019s optical properties, actuated by the cavity optical field and subject to backaction by the quantum force fluctuations of this field. Experimentally, we quantify such fluctuations by measuring the cavity-light-induced heating of the intracavity atomic ensemble. These \u2026",
                "We have produced Bose-Einstein condensates in a ring-shaped magnetic waveguide. The few-millimeter diameter, nonzero-bias ring is formed from a time-averaged quadrupole ring. Condensates that propagate around the ring make several revolutions within the time it takes for them to expand to fill the ring. The ring shape is ideally suited for studies of vorticity in a multiply connected geometry and is promising as a rotation sensor."
