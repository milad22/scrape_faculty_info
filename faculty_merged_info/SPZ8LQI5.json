                "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",
                "A measurement of the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated prompt photons in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy s= 7 TeV is presented. The measurement covers the pseudorapidity ranges| \u03b7 \u03b3|< 1.37 and 1.52\u2264| \u03b7 \u03b3|< 1.81 in the transverse energy range 15\u2264 E T \u03b3< 100 GeV. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 880 nb\u2212 1, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Photon candidates are identified by combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate. The results are compared to predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.",
                "Modern general-purpose detectors at high-energy colliders are based on the concept of cylindrical detection layers, nested around the beam axis. Starting from the beam interaction region, particles first enter a tracker, in which charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and origins (vertices) are reconstructed from signals (hits) in the sensitive layers. The tracker is immersed in a magnetic field that bends the trajectories and allows the electric charges and momenta of charged particles to be measured. Electrons and photons are then absorbed in an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The corresponding electromagnetic showers are detected as clusters of energy recorded in neighbouring cells, from which the energy and direction of the particles can be determined. Charged and neutral hadrons may initiate a hadronic shower in the ECAL as well, which is subsequently fully absorbed in the hadron calorimeter (HCAL \u2026",
                "We report the first measurement of charged particle elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at s N N= 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region (| \u03b7|< 0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2< p t< 5.0 GeV\/c. The elliptic flow signal v 2, measured using the 4-particle correlation method, averaged over transverse momentum and pseudorapidity is 0.087\u00b10.002 (stat)\u00b10.003 (syst) in the 40%\u201350% centrality class. The differential elliptic flow v 2 (p t) reaches a maximum of 0.2 near p t= 3 GeV\/c. Compared to RHIC Au-Au collisions at s N N= 200 GeV, the elliptic flow increases by about 30%. Some hydrodynamic model predictions which include viscous corrections are in agreement with the observed increase.",
                "The production of the prompt charm mesons D 0, D+, D*+, and their antiparticles, was measured with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision. The p t-differential production yields in the range 2< p t< 16 GeV\/c at central rapidity,| y|< 0.5, were used to calculate the nuclear modification factor R AA with respect to a proton-proton reference obtained from the cross section measured at and scaled to. For the three meson species, R AA shows a suppression by a factor 3\u20134, for transverse momenta larger than 5 GeV\/c in the 20% most central collisions. The suppression is reduced for peripheral collisions.",
                "The centrality dependence of the charged-particle multiplicity density at midrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV is presented. The charged-particle density normalized per participating nucleon pair increases by about a factor of 2 from peripheral (70%\u201380%) to central (0%\u20135%) collisions. The centrality dependence is found to be similar to that observed at lower collision energies. The data are compared with models based on different mechanisms for particle production in nuclear collisions.",

                "The spectra of charged particles produced within the pseudorapidity window| \u03b7|< 1 at TeV are measured using 404 \u03bcb\u2212 1 of PbPb and 27.4 pb\u2212 1 of pp data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2015. The spectra are presented over the transverse momentum ranges spanning 0. 5< p T< 400 GeV in pp and 0. 7< p T< 400 GeV in PbPb collisions. The corresponding nuclear modification factor, R AA, is measured in bins of collision centrality. The R AA in the 5% most central collisions shows a maximal suppression by a factor of 7-8 in the p T region of 6-9 GeV. This dip is followed by an increase, which continues up to the highest p T measured, and approaches unity in the vicinity of p T= 200 GeV. The R AA is compared to theoretical predictions and earlier experimental results at lower collision energies. The newly measured pp spectrum is combined with the pPb spectrum previously published by the \u2026"
