Key reactions in hydrogen, helium, and carbon burning building the fuel for subsequent stellar explosions as novae and supernovae. Of particular interest are the nuclear processes in the very first stars, bridging the Big Bang to the universe today. These processes are being studied experimentally at the 5U Pelletron accelerator of the NSL but also at the first US accelerator deep (one mile) underground, the CASPAR accelerator owned and operated by the group. The program in nuclear astrophysics has generated several spin-off activities for which new students are being looked for. A program in material studies using a broad portfolio of atomic and nuclear spectroscopy techniques has been developed for a broad range of material studies, is being applied for forensic analysis as well as for cultural history applications. In close collaboration with the National Laboratories new initiatives have been started by the group to study radiation effects on environmental and technical materials. For this purpose a neutron beam facility is being developed at Notre Dame opening up a broad range of applications which will be pursued in the near future. \u201cCritical Reactions in Contemporary Nuclear Astrophysics\u201d, M.
