                "In the area of digital library services, the access to subject-specific metadata of scholarly publications is of utmost interest. One of the most prevalent approaches for metadata exchange is the XML-based Open Archive Initiative (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). However, due to its loose requirements regarding metadata content there is no strict standard for consistent subject indexing specified, which is furthermore needed in the digital library domain. This contribution addresses the problem of automatic enhancement of OAI metadata by means of the most widely used universal classification schemes in libraries\u2014the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC). To be more specific, we automatically classify scientific documents according to the DDC taxonomy within three levels using a machine learning-based classifier that relies solely on OAI metadata records as the document representation \u2026",
                "The ongoing rise of digital libraries that store and disseminate the academic output of individual institutions\u2014so-called institutional repositories\u2014is vitally connected to the success of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and its Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The key concept of OAI-PMH is to ease metadata exchange between digital libraries using a standardized XML-based format for encoding bibliographic records, thereby fostering the fast distribution of scholarly information (Lagoze and Van de Sompel, 2001). Despite this success, however, little attention has been given to the OAI domain as a source of primary data. Since most of the metadata distributed via the protocol describes academic publications, it is potentially interesting to a range of fields including linguistics, natural language processing, and text mining. Recently, metadata records in the OAI Dublin Core (OAI DC) format",
                "In this paper, we tackle the challenge of linking scholarly information in multi-disciplinary research infrastructures. There is a trend towards linking publications with research data and other information, but, as it is still emerging, this is handled differently by various initiatives and disciplines. For OpenAIRE, a European cross-disciplinary publication infrastructure, this poses the challenge of supporting these heterogeneous practices. Hence, OpenAIRE wants to contribute to the development of a common approach for discipline-independent linking practices between publications, data, project information and researchers. To this end, we constructed two demonstrators to identify commonalities and differences. The results show the importance of stable and unique identifiers, and support a \u201cby reference\u201d approach of interlinking research results. This approach allows discipline-specific research information to be managed independently in distributed systems and avoids redundant maintenance. Furthermore, it allows these disciplinary systems to manage the specialized structures of their contents themselves.",
                "There is no doubt that the increased visibility of publications deposited in freely accessible documents servers is an important motivation for scholars to publish their works Open Access. Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) is a service provider that indexes scientific content stored in both institutional and subject repositories. After a short introduction to the technical and conceptual background, this article describes the features of BASE and finally projects future developments to be taken out to further improve the system.",
                "OpenAIRE supports the European Commission Open Access policy by providing an infrastructure for researchers to comply with the European Union Open Access mandate. The OpenAIREplus project\u20132nd Generation of Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe\u2013is a 30 month project funded by the European Commission 7th Framework Programme, and extends the mission of OpenAIRE (initiated in December 2009) further to facilitate access to the entire Open Access scientific production of the European Research Area, providing cross-links from publications to data and funding schemes. This large-scale project brings together 41 pan-European partners, including three cross-disciplinary research communities. The project will capitalize on the successful efforts of OpenAIRE, which is rapidly moving from implementing the European Union Open Access Pilot project into a service phase, enabling researchers to deposit their 7th Framework Programme and European Research Area funded research publications into Open Access repositories.Exposure and visibility of content from a range of European repositories will be significantly increased when a common and interoperable approach is taken and care to adhere to existing guidelines. This compatibility will lead to future interoperability between research infrastructures, and structured metadata is of benefit to individual data repositories and the knowledge community at large.",

Are living systems therefore somehow miraculously exempt from the laws of physics? \u2013 Not at all! Rather, they have \"learned\" to exploit loopholes in the dictate of entropy in truly stunning ways! Biological physics is a fascinating branch of \"mainstream physics\" that tries to solve the underlying puzzles. Our work in experimental biophysics focuses on the functional, structural and dynamic characterization of biomimetic membranes \u2013 that is, artifical and lipid bilayer systems that are simpler than complex biological membranes but capture their fundamental physics aspects. For example, we use surface-sensitive x-ray and neutron scattering alongside with electrochemical and advanced optical techniques to identify, characterize, and optimize membrane models in which we study the association of proteins with lipid bilayers, such as the one shown here. Microscopy techniques are used to assess the in-plane fluidity, dynamics, and 2D morphology of such systems. With this set of tools, we investigate experimentally the physical principles of membrane self-assembly and functionality. We also study the molecular origins of disease, through quantification of the membrane interactions of proteins and peptides, such as neurotransmitters, toxins or tumor suppressor proteins. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms, and help characterize cellular attack through pathogens and the self-assembly of viral particles, such as HIV, in affected cells.

Their length scales range from nanometers, the thickness of a biomembrane, to micrometers, the length of polymers that form the cytoskeleton. They are chemically diverse \u2013  building blocks include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and polysaccharides \u2013 and formidably complex. As are the underlying interactions: Van-der-Waals, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces all contribute to their specific organization. Since these interactions are  characterized by thermal energies, the resulting structures are highly dynamic, capable of reorganizing in response to a changing environment. We are particularly interested in biomembranes and membrane-related biological processes. For example, many toxins exert their damage on target cells by interfering with membrane functions. Misfolded peptides affect membranes of neuronal cells so that the communication between these cells is abolished; diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are the consequence. As a further example, viral assembly, such as that of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus occurs at the  plasma membrane of host cells and is a complex process involving specific interactions between proteins, viral nucleic acid and specific membrane components, which is poorly understood. Traditional biological tools have been invaluable in identifying the molecular components of biomolecular assemblies and determining their qualitative functions. Yet, an integrated understanding of the underlying mechanisms and principles, as well as their dynamic function is  largely incomplete. Physics contributes to this understanding on many levels, from providing a theoretical framework for the quantitative description of Soft Condensed Matter to providing experimental characterization tools for probing the dynamics of  function, assembly and disassembly.\n      Progress in the understanding of supramolecular complexes will impact science and technology areas far beyond biology. Already to date it exerts a significant impact on materials engineering and biotechnology, and is likely to extend into areas yet unforeseen. News October 2015 Research article published in Structure . Heinrich et al. demonstrate that PTEN, a biomedically importa nt tumor suppressor, forms dimers in solution using small angle x-ray scattering. This finding may have important consequences for our understanding of PTEN function in the cell.
