Son University Professor Dept. of Physics, Enrico Fermi Institute, James Franck Institute, Kadanoff Center for Theoretical Physics, and the College Address: MCP 465 Phone: 773-834-9032 dtson@uchicago.edu I have a broad research program encompassing several areas of theoretical physics.\u200b String Theory : applications of gauge-gravity duality in the physics of the quark-gluon plasma and other strongly interacting systems. : properties of the hot and dense states of matter, e.g., the quark gluon plasma and dense quark matter (color superconductors). Condensed matter physics : physics of the quantum Hall system, graphene; applications of quantum field theory. Atomic physics : many-body physics of cold trapped atoms, BCS-BEC crossover, applications of quantum field theoretical techniques. Selected Publications R. Baier, A.H. Mueller, D. Schiff, and D.T.
