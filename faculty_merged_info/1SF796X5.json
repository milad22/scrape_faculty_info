                "We determine the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator where the coordinates and momenta are assumed to obey the modified commutation relations [x i, p j]= i \u0127 [(1+ \u03b2 p 2) \u03b4 ij+ \u03b2\u2032 p i p j]. These commutation relations are motivated by the fact that they lead to the minimal length uncertainty relations which appear in perturbative string theory. Our solutions illustrate how certain features of string theory may manifest themselves in simple quantum mechanical systems through the modification of the canonical commutation relations. We discuss whether such effects are observable in precision measurements on electrons trapped in strong magnetic fields.",
                "We investigate the effect of the minimal length uncertainty relation, motivated by perturbative string theory, on the density of states in momentum space. The relation is implemented through the modified commutation relation [x i, p j]= i \u0127 [(1+ \u03b2 p 2) \u03b4 ij+ \u03b2\u2032 p i p j]. We point out that this relation, which is an example of a UV\/IR relation, implies the finiteness of the cosmological constant. While our result does not solve the cosmological constant problem, it does shed new light on the relation between this outstanding problem and UV\/IR correspondence. We also point out that the blackbody radiation spectrum will be modified at higher frequencies, but the effect is too small to be observed in the cosmic microwave background spectrum.",
                "We continue our investigation of the phenomenological implications of the \u201cdeformed\u201d commutation relations [x i, p j]= i \u0127 [(1+ \u03b2 p 2) \u03b4 ij+ \u03b2\u2032 p i p j]. These commutation relations are motivated by the fact that they lead to the minimal length uncertainty relation which appears in perturbative string theory. In this paper, we consider the effects of the deformation on the classical orbits of particles in a central force potential. Comparison with observation places severe constraints on the value of the minimum length.",
                "We present theories of gravitation based, respectively, on the general linear group GL (n, R) and its inhomogeneous extension IGL (n, R)[(SO (n\u2212 1, 1) and [ISO (n\u2212 1, 1) for torsion-free manifolds]. Noting that the geometry of the conventional gauge theories can be described in terms of a fiber bundle, and that their action is a scalar in such a superspace, we construct principal fiber bundles based on the above gauge groups and propose to describe gravitation in terms of their corresponding scalar curvatures. To ensure that these manifolds do indeed have close ties with the space-time of general relativity, we make use of the notion of the parallel transport of vector fields in space-time to uniquely relate the connections in space-time to the gauge potentials in fiber bundles. The relations turn out to be similar to that suggested earlier by Yang. The actions we obtain are related to those of Einstein and Yang but are \u2026",
                "The energy spectrum of the Coulomb potential with minimal length commutation relations [X i, P j]= i \u210f {\u03b4 i j (1+ \u03b2 P 2)+ \u03b2\u2032 P i P j} is determined both numerically and perturbatively for arbitrary values of \u03b2\u2032\u2215 \u03b2 and angular momenta \u2113. The constraint on the minimal length scale from precision hydrogen spectroscopy data is of the order of a few GeV\u2212 1, weaker than previously claimed.",
                "An ionically self-assembled monolayer (ISAM) technique for thin-film deposition has been employed to fabricate materials possessing the noncentrosymmetry that is requisite for a second-order, \u03c7(2), nonlinear optical response. As a result of the ionic attraction between successive layers, the ISAM \u03c7(2) films self-assemble into a noncentrosymmetric structure that has exhibited no measurable decay of \u03c7(2) at room temperature over a period of more than one year. The second-harmonic intensity of the films exhibits the expected quadratic dependence on film thickness up to at least 100 bilayers, corresponding to a film thickness of 120 nm. The polarization dependence of the second-harmonic generation yields a value of 35\u00b0 for the average tilt angle of the nonlinear optical chromophores away from the surface normal.",
                "A geometrical analysis of local gauge invariance is presented. By extending the four directions in space-time which can define a light cone to an enlarged tangent space, we construct a superspace in which the intimate relationship between purely kinematic invariances and those of local internal symmetry groups are explored. Three applications are considered:(1) Local gauge theories in flat or curved space-time are derived from a scalar action in superspace. As a result, the theory has an extra dimensional parameter.(2) Born-Infeld electrodynamics and its non-Abelian counterpart are extended to curved space-time. This suggests a new set of gravitational field equations.(3) The formalism is extended to the case in which the connection forms anticommute and supersymmetric string models are constructed, which give action-principle formulations of the known dual models involving fermions and suggest \u2026",
                "We present a general discussion of B-L violation in an SU (5) invariant theory, for a single generation of light fermions. We realize the simplest of such mechanism through the 15 Higgs. Its consequences for neutron oscillation are discussed.",
                "Making use of the similarity between the factorized spectrum of the generalized beta function and the spectrum of a vibrating string in Minkowski space, we construct a formalism within which we give a geometrical interpretation to the gauge symmetries inherent in the theory. The key point in the construction is the identification of the harmonic-oscillator amplitude with the components of actual coordinates in space-time. It turns out that these coordinates must satisfy certain constraints arising from purely geometrical considerations, and these constraint equations are then shown to be the familiar gauge conditions on the underlying states. Analogies with more familiar gauge theories are pointed out.",
                "The 2014 west African epidemic of Ebola virus disease posed a major threat to the health systems of the countries affected. We sought to quantify the consequences of Ebola virus disease on maternal and child health services in the highly-affected Forest region of Guinea.We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of women and children attending public health facilities for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and immunisation services in six of seven health districts in the Forest region (Beyla, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Kissidougou, Lola, Macenta, and N'Z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9). We examined monthly service use data for eight maternal and child health services indicators: antenatal care (\u22651 antenatal care visit and \u22653 antenatal care visits), institutional delivery, and receipt of five infant vaccines: polio, pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B virus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b), yellow fever \u2026"
