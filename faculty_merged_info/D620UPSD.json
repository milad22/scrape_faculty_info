Palladino Assistant Professor kpalladino@wisc.edu (608) 262-8285 4219 Chamberlin Hall High Energy Physics Direct Dark Matter Searches I primarily work in the field of direct dark matter searches with the two-phase liquid xenon TPCs LUX and LZ. Our group focuses on detector performance including high voltage and xenon handling.  These detectors are generally looking for WIMP (weakly interacting massive particles) dark matter candidates via nuclear recoils. Neutron induced nuclear recoils are studied for backgrounds and calibration. We are also involved in detector R&#038;D for nuclear recoil detection. Directions to room 4219, Chamberlin Hall or stairs to the 4th floor. Facing into the hallway, away from the two elevators, turn right. Follow the hallway to room 4219, which will be on your left."
