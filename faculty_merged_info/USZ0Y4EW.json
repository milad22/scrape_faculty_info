                "A through analysis is made of the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T c on material properties (\u03bb, \u03bc*, phonon spectrum) as contained in Eliashberg theory. The most striking new feature of the analysis is in the asymptotic regime of very large \u03bb where T c is found to equal 0.15 (\u03bb< \u03c9 2>) 1 2 (assuming \u03bc*= 0.1). This result implies the surprising conclusion that within Eliashberg theory T c is not limited by the phonon frequencies, and also shows that McMillan's\" \u03bb= 2 limit\" is spurious. The McMillan equation (with a prefactor altered from \u0398 D 1.45 to \u03c9 log 1.2) is found to be highly accurate for all known materials with \u03bb< 1.5 but in error for large values of \u03bb. Correction factors to McMillan's equation are found in terms of \u03bb, \u03bc*, and one additional parameter,(< \u03c9 2>) 1 2 \u03c9 log. The frequency \u03c9 log is defined as exp< ln \u03c9> where the averages< ln \u03c9> and< \u03c9 2> are defined using (2 \u03bb \u03c9) \u03b1 2 F (\u03c9) as a \u2026",
                "We have measured the quasiparticle recombination time in the strong-coupled superconductor Pb 0.9 Bi 0.1 directly by measuring the lifetime-broadened energy gap edge. This is done by measuring the I\u2212 V characteristics of a superconducting tunnel junction of the type Pb 0.9 Bi 0.1-insulator-Pb 0.9 Bi 0.1. Agreement with the calculated value is excellent.",
                "The voltage\u2010dependent tunneling conductance of trapezoidal potential barriers has been calculated using two extreme models of (1) the WKB approximation and (2) perfectly sharp boundaries between the metal electrode and the insulator. We show that for both models the conductance\u2010voltage plot is roughly parabolic at low voltages (\u22720.4\u2009V). The minimum conductance is not at zero bias unless the barrier is symmetrical and identical Fermi energies are chosen for the two metal electrodes. The inclusion of image forces does not radically alter the shape of the conductance\u2010voltage dependence. Using reasonable barrier shapes, the asymmetry of the calculated conductance about V=0 is not as large as we frequently observe experimentally. We point out that this extreme asymmetry appears to be associated with the presence of organic impurities in the oxide layer of the junction.",
                "The Abrikosov flux lattice is imaged in Nb Se 2 by tunneling into the superconducting gap edge with a low-temperature scanning-tunneling microscope. The tunneling conductance into a single vortex core is strongly peaked at the Fermi energy, suggesting the existence of core states or core excitations. As one moves away from the core, this feature evolves into a density of states which is consistent with a BCS superconducting gap.",
                "Electric-field control of magnetization has many potential applications in magnetic memory storage, sensors and spintronics. One approach to obtain this control is through multiferroic materials. Instead of using direct coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order parameters in a single-phase multiferroic material, which only shows a weak magnetoelectric effect, a unique method using indirect coupling through an intermediate antiferromagnetic order parameter can be used. In this article, we demonstrate electrical control of exchange bias using a field-effect device employing multiferroic (ferroelectric\/antiferromagnetic) BiFeO 3 as the dielectric and ferromagnetic La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 as the conducting channel; we can reversibly switch between two distinct exchange-bias states by switching the ferroelectric polarization of BiFeO 3. This is an important step towards controlling magnetization with electric fields \u2026"

Currently I am interested in two areas; one associated with the physics of high Tc superconductivity and the underlying mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Associated with these materials, I also work on the applications of superconductivity. The other area is concerned with strong disorder and dimensionality in conductors and superconductors. Using state of the art technology we fabricate one- and two-dimensional conductors and study their properties. The relationship between dimensionality, disorder and the nature of electrical transport has fundamental underpinnings."
