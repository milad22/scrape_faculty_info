Both projects are direct searches for neutrino flavor oscillations, which in turn probe indirectly the hypothesis of a non-vanishing neutrino mass. The BooNE experiment, currently under construction, is designed to confirm (or dismiss) the positive LSND signals and to measure the neutrino mixing parameters with high accuracy. In parallel to his active involvement in these experimental projects, Dr. Stancu is also interested in neutrino oscillations phenomenology. Dr. Stancu received his doctoral degree from Rice University in 1990. He held postdoctoral and faculty research positions at the Bonner Nuclear Laboratory (Rice U.) and the University of California-Riverside. He joined the University of Alabama faculty in 2000."
