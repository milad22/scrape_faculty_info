                "We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, D-and B-meson physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the particle-physics community. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor f+(0), arising in the semileptonic K\u2192 \u03c0 transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay constant ratio f K\/f \u03c0 and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements V u s and V u d. Furthermore, we describe the results obtained on the lattice for some of the low-energy constants of S U (2) L\u00d7 S U (2) R and S U (3) L\u00d7 S U (3) R Chiral Perturbation Theory. We review the determination of the B K parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four B parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. The latter quantities are an addition compared to the previous review. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for m c and m b (also new \u2026",
                "We describe a technique for constructing the effective chiral theory for quenched QCD. The effective theory which results is a Lagrangian one, with a graded symmetry group which mixes Goldstone bosons and fermions, and with a definite (though slightly peculiar) set of Feynman rules. The straightforward application of these rules gives automatic cancellation of diagrams which would arise from virtual quark loops. The techniques are used to calculate chiral logarithms in f K f \u03c0, m \u03c0, m K, and the ratio of< s s> to< u u>. The leading finite-volume corrections to these quantities are also computed. Problems for future study are described.",
                "We extend our Lagrangian technique for chiral perturbation theory for quenched QCD to include theories in which only some of the quarks are quenched. We discuss the relationship between the partially quenched theory and a theory in which only the unquenched quarks are present. We also investigate the peculiar infrared divergences associated with the \u03b7\u2032 in the quenched approximation, and find the conditions under which such divergences can appear in a partially quenched theory. We then apply our results to staggered fermion QCD in which the square root of the fermion determinant is taken, using the observation that this should correspond to a theory with four quarks, two of which are quenched."
