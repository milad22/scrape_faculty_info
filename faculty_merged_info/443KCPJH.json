                "The realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional van der Waals crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, could lead to new magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications 1, 2, 3, 4. In two-dimensional systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly suppressed by thermal fluctuations, according to the Mermin\u2013Wagner theorem 5; however, these thermal fluctuations can be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy. Previous efforts, based on defect and composition engineering 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or the proximity effect, introduced magnetic responses only locally or extrinsically. Here we report intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 atomic layers, as revealed by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In this magnetically soft, two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, we achieve unprecedented control of the transition temperature \u2026",
                "The polar Kerr effect in the spin-triplet superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 was measured with high precision using a Sagnac interferometer with a zero-area Sagnac loop. We observed nonzero Kerr rotations as big as 65 nanorad appearing below T c in large domains. Our results imply a broken time-reversal symmetry state in the superconducting state of Sr 2 RuO 4, similar to He 3\u2212 A.",
                "The polar Kerr effect in the high-T c superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x was measured at zero magnetic field with high precision using a cyogenic Sagnac fiber interferometer. We observed nonzero Kerr rotations of order\u223c 1 \u03bc rad appearing near the pseudogap temperature T* and marking what appears to be a true phase transition. Anomalous magnetic behavior in magnetic-field training of the effect suggests that time reversal symmetry is already broken above room temperature."
