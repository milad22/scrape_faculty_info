                "Salient stimuli redirect attention and suppress ongoing motor activity. This attentional shift is thought to rely upon thalamic signals to the striatum to shift cortically driven action selection, but the network mechanisms underlying this interaction are unclear. Using a brain slice preparation that preserved cortico- and thalamostriatal connectivity, it was found that activation of thalamostriatal axons in a way that mimicked the response to salient stimuli induced a burst of spikes in striatal cholinergic interneurons that was followed by a pause lasting more than half a second. This patterned interneuron activity triggered a transient, presynaptic suppression of cortical input to both major classes of principal medium spiny neuron (MSN) that gave way to a prolonged enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness in striatopallidal MSNs controlling motor suppression. This differential regulation of the corticostriatal circuitry provides a \u2026",

                "Primary motor cortex (MI) neurons discharge vigorously during voluntary movement. A cardinal symptom of Parkinson9s disease (PD) is poverty of movement (akinesia). Current models of PD thus hypothesize that increased inhibitory pallidal output reduces firing rates in frontal cortex, including MI, resulting in akinesia and muscle rigidity. We recorded the simultaneous spontaneous discharge of several neurons in the arm-related area of MI of two monkeys and in the globus pallidus (GP) of one of the two. Accelerometers were fastened to the forelimbs to detect movement, and surface electromyograms were recorded from the contralateral arm of one monkey. The recordings were conducted before and after systemic treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rendering the animals severely akinetic and rigid with little or no tremor. The mean spontaneous MI rates during periods of immobility \u2026",
                "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) for many patients. The most effective stimulation consists of high-frequency biphasic stimulation pulses around 130 Hz delivered between two active sites of an implanted depth electrode to the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Multiple studies have shown that a key effect of STN-DBS that correlates well with clinical outcome is the reduction of synchronous and oscillatory activity in cortical and basal ganglia networks. We hypothesized that antidromic cortical activation may provide an underlying mechanism responsible for this effect, because stimulation is usually performed in proximity to cortical efferent pathways. We show with intracellular cortical recordings in rats that STN-DBS did in fact lead to antidromic spiking of deep layer cortical neurons. Furthermore, antidromic spikes triggered a dampened oscillation of local field potentials \u2026",
                "Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose symptoms are caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons innervating the striatum. As striatal dopamine levels fall, striatal acetylcholine release rises, exacerbating motor symptoms. This adaptation is commonly attributed to the loss of interneuronal regulation by inhibitory D 2 dopamine receptors. Our results point to a completely different, new mechanism. After striatal dopamine depletion, D 2 dopamine receptor modulation of calcium (Ca 2+) channels controlling vesicular acetylcholine release in interneurons was unchanged, but M 4 muscarinic autoreceptor coupling to these same channels was markedly attenuated. This adaptation was attributable to the upregulation of RGS4\u2014an autoreceptor-associated, GTPase-accelerating protein. This specific signaling adaptation extended to a broader loss of autoreceptor control of interneuron spiking. These \u2026",
                "Cortical local field potentials (LFPs) reflect synaptic potentials and accordingly correlate with neuronal discharge. Because LFPs are coherent across substantial cortical areas, we hypothesized that cortical spike correlations could be predicted from them. Because LFPs recorded in the basal ganglia (BG) are also correlated with neuronal discharge and are clinically accessible in Parkinson9s disease patients, we were interested in testing this hypothesis in the BG, as well. We recorded LFPs and unit discharge from multiple electrodes, which were placed in primary motor cortex or in the basal ganglia (striatum and pallidum) of two monkeys before and after rendering them parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. We used the method of partial spectra to construct LFP predictors of the spike cross-correlation functions (CCFs). The predicted CCF is an estimate of the correlation between two \u2026",
                "Previous physiological studies have revealed changes in firing rates and synchronization of pallidal neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of Parkinson9s disease. Several primate and human studies have demonstrated that dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) reverses the changes in the pallidal firing rates; however, the effects of DRT on pallidal synchronization have never been explored. To do so, we recorded the simultaneous activity of pallidal neurons of a vervet monkey before and after induction of severe parkinsonism by systemic MPTP treatment. We subsequently recorded the pallidal activity before and after daily administration of oral DRT. We extended the time scale of our correlation studies to \u00b15 sec to allow detection of long-duration synchronized neuronal activity. After MPTP treatment, firing rates decreased in the external segment of the globus pallidus \u2026",
                "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major world-wide health problem afflicting millions of the aged population. Factors that act on most or all cell types (pan-cellular factors), particularly genetic mutations and environmental toxins, have dominated public discussions of disease etiology.

                "The spontaneous firing patterns of striatal cholinergic interneurons are sculpted by potassium currents that give rise to prominent afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs). Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel currents contribute to action potential (AP) repolarization; small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel currents generate an apamin-sensitive medium AHP (mAHP) after each AP; and bursts of APs generate long-lasting slow AHPs (sAHPs) attributable to apamin-insensitive currents. Because all these currents are calcium dependent, we conducted voltage- and current-clamp whole-cell recordings while pharmacologically manipulating calcium channels of the plasma membrane and intracellular stores to determine what sources of calcium activate the currents underlying AP repolarization and the AHPs. The Cav2.2 (N-type) blocker \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA (1 \u03bcm) was the only blocker that \u2026",
