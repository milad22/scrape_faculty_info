                "Many researchers, especially those new to the field, need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy, either for the purposes of their own research, or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review. 1 Acceptable standards are an important issue, particularly considering that each of us may have his\/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately, the answer is in part a \u201cmoving target\u201d as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria, only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas. Conversely, as a reviewer, it is tiresome to raise the same objections repeatedly, wondering why researchers have not fulfilled some of the basic requirements for establishing the occurrence of an autophagic process. In addition, drugs that potentially modulate autophagy are increasingly being used in clinical trials, and \u2026",
                "Research in autophagy continues to accelerate, 1 and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. 2, 3 There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from fully functional autophagy that \u2026",
                "Neuronal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein and Lewy body formation are characteristic to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson9s disease (PD). This Lewy pathology appears to spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Furthermore, recent studies showed the occurrence of Lewy pathology in neurons grafted into the brains of PD patients, suggesting the spread of pathology from the host tissues to the grafts. The mechanism underlying this propagation is unknown. Here, we show that \u03b1-synuclein is transmitted via endocytosis to neighboring neurons and neuronal precursor cells, forming Lewy-like inclusions. Moreover, \u03b1-synuclein was transmitted from the affected neurons to engrafted neuronal precursor cells in a transgenic model of PD-like pathology. Failure of the protein quality control systems, especially lysosomes, promoted the accumulation of transmitted \u03b1-synuclein and inclusion \u2026",
                "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn), particularly in its aggregated forms, is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson9s disease and other related neurological disorders. However, the normal biology of \u03b1-syn and how it relates to the aggregation of the protein are not clearly understood. Because of the lack of the signal sequence and its predominant localization in the cytosol, \u03b1-syn is generally considered exclusively an intracellular protein. Contrary to this assumption, here, we show that a small percentage of newly synthesized \u03b1-syn is rapidly secreted from cells via unconventional, endoplasmic reticulum\/Golgi-independent exocytosis. Consistent with this finding, we also demonstrate that a portion of cellular \u03b1-syn is present in the lumen of vesicles. Importantly, the intravesicular \u03b1-syn is more prone to aggregation than the cytosolic protein, and aggregated forms of \u03b1-syn are also secreted from cells. Furthermore, secretion of \u2026",
                "Abnormal neuronal aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein is implicated in the development of many neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Glial cells also show extensive \u03b1-synuclein pathology and may contribute to disease progression. However, the mechanism that produces the glial \u03b1-synuclein pathology and the interaction between neurons and glia in the disease-inflicted microenvironment remain unknown. Here, we show that \u03b1-synuclein proteins released from neuronal cells are taken up by astrocytes through endocytosis and form inclusion bodies. The glial accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein through the transmission of the neuronal protein was also demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model expressing human \u03b1-synuclein. Furthermore, astrocytes that were exposed to neuronal \u03b1-synuclein underwent changes in the gene expression profile reflecting an inflammatory response \u2026",
                "\u03b1-Synuclein exists as at least two structural isoforms: a helix-rich, membrane-bound form and a disordered, cytosolic form. Here, we investigated the role of membrane-bound \u03b1-synuclein in the aggregation process. In a cell-free system consisting of isolated brain fractions, spontaneous and progressive aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein was observed in membranes starting at day 1, whereas no aggregation was observed in the cytosolic fraction in a 3-day period. The addition of antioxidants reduced the aggregation in the membrane fraction, implicating the role of oxidative modifications. When excess cytosolic \u03b1-synuclein was added to brain membranes, the rate of aggregation was increased, while the lag time was unaffected. Incorporation of cytosolic \u03b1-synuclein into membrane-associated aggregates was demonstrated by fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In our recent study, we showed that \u2026",
                "Abnormal aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and sustained microglial activation are important contributors to the pathogenic processes of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, the relationship between disease-associated protein aggregation and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation remains unknown. Here, using a combination of in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that extracellular \u03b1-synuclein released from neuronal cells is an endogenous agonist for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which activates inflammatory responses in microglia. The TLR2 ligand activity of \u03b1-synuclein is conformation-sensitive; only specific types of oligomer can interact with and activate TLR2. This paracrine interaction between neuron-released oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein and TLR2 in microglia suggests that both of these proteins are novel therapeutic targets for modification of neuroinflammation in Parkinson\u2019s disease and related neurological \u2026",
                "Abnormal folding and accumulation of a-synuclein is implicated in several neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease. Although a-synuclein is a typical cytoplasmic protein, a small amount of both monomeric and aggregated forms is secreted from cells and is present in human body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid. Extracellular a-synuclein aggregates have been shown to be neurotoxic, posing a challenge to any cell exposed to them. Here, we examine the internalization of various forms of extracellular a-synuclein, including fibrils, oligomers, and monomer, into neuronal cells and their subsequent degradation. Internalization of fibrillar a-synuclein could be inhibited by low temperature or the expression of a dominant-negative mutant dynamin-1 K44A, suggesting the endocytosis-mediated internalization. The internalized fibrils moved through the endosomal pathway and were degraded in the lysosome \u2026",
                "Cytoplasmic deposition of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates is a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Strong evidence for the causative role of \u03b1-synuclein in these disorders is provided by genetic linkage between this gene and familial Parkinson9s disease and by neurodegeneration in transgenic animals that overexpress this protein. In particular, it has been hypothesized that the accumulation of nonfibrillar oligomers of \u03b1-synuclein, which serve as intermediates for fibrillar inclusion body formation, causes neurodegeneration. However, little is known about how cells handle potentially toxic protein aggregates. Here we demonstrate that cells are capable of clearing preformed \u03b1-synuclein aggregates via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Consequently, blocking this pathway causes the accumulation of the aggregates in non-neuronal cells, differentiated neuroblastoma cells, and primary \u2026",
                "Amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates of intracellular proteins are common pathological features of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, the nature of pathogenic aggregates and the biological consequences of their formation remain elusive. Here, we describe (i) a model cellular system in which prefibrillar \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and fibrillar inclusions are naturally formed in the cytoplasm with distinctive kinetics and (ii) a tight correlation between the presence of prefibrillar aggregates and the Golgi fragmentation. Consistent with the structural abnormality of Golgi apparatus, trafficking and maturation of dopamine transporter through the biosynthetic pathway were impaired in the presence of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Reduction in cell viability was also observed in the prefibrillar aggregate-forming condition and before the inclusion formation. The fibrillar inclusions, on the other hand, showed no correlation with \u2026"
