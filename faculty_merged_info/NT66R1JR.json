Curt worked with Professor Richard Kokes for his doctorate and then with CO Bennett, W. K. Hall, and VB Kazanski as a postdoc. His early research was on mechanistic studies of catalysis including the first double isotope studies of CO oxidation. He then worked on oxyhydrochlorination and partial oxidation during a five year period with Allied Chemical Corp. He came to the University of Massachusetts in 1979 andhas worked on spillover, olefin polymerization, and catalyst pore-network structure characterization. He has been a guest professor in France.

                "Zeolite membranes have uniform, molecular-sized pores, and they separate molecules based on differences in the molecules\u2019 adsorption and diffusion properties. Zeolite membranes are thus well suited for separating liquid-phase mixtures by pervaporation, and the first commercial application of zeolite membranes has been for dehydrating organic compounds. Because of the large number of zeolites that can be prepared, zeolite membranes have also been used to remove organic compounds from water, separate organic mixtures, and remove water from acid solutions on the laboratory scale. The fundamental aspects of separations by pervaporation through zeolite membranes are reviewed, and examples of the selectivities and fluxes obtained are presented. Some aspects of these separations are similar to gas-phase separations using zeolite membranes, but feed-side coverages are close to saturation during \u2026",
                "In a typical temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment on a supported metal catalyst, a small amount of catalyst (10\u2013200 mg) is contained in a reactor that can be heated by a furnace. An inert gas, usually helium at atmospheric pressure, flows over the catalyst. Following pretreatment to obtain a reduced catalyst, a gas is adsorbed on the surface, usually by pulse injections of the adsorbate into the carrier gas upstream from the reactor. After the excess gas is flushed out, the catalyst is heated to create a linear rise in temperature with time. A small thermocouple inserted in the catalyst measures the temperature and a detector downstream measures the change in the inert gas stream. The ideal detector is a mass spectrometer which measures the composition of the effluent stream as a function of catalyst temperature. Because of the high carrier-gas flow rate, the detector response is proportional to \u2026",
                "Continuous SAPO-34 membranes with low concentrations of non-zeolite pores were synthesized by in situ crystallization on porous stainless steel and \u03b1-Al2O3 supports. These membranes separated CO2 from CH4 with selectivity as high as 67 at 297 K for a CO2 permeance of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 mol\/m2 s Pa. The membranes are selective for CO2 because CO2 preferentially adsorbs, and it also diffuses faster than CH4. The CO2 and CH4 heats of adsorption were measured on SAPO-34 crystals as 24 \u00b1 0.8 and 16 \u00b1 0.8 kJ\/mol, respectively. Selectivity depended on temperature, feed pressure, and pressure drop. A maximum in CO2 permeance was observed near 275 K for both the single gas and a CO2\/CH4 mixture. The CO2\/CH4 selectivity decreased as temperature increased from 253 to 473 K. As trans-membrane pressure drop increased, the CO2 flux increased, but the CO2 permeate concentration showed a \u2026",
                "SAPO-34 membranes were prepared by in situ crystallization on \u03b1-Al2O3 porous supports. The crystal size of the seeds was effectively controlled in the 0.7 to 8.5 \u00b5m range by employing different structure-directing agents. Seeds smaller than 1 \u00b5m produced membranes with CO2\/CH4 separation selectivities higher than 170 and unprecedented CO2 permeances as high as \u223c2.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol\/m2\u00b7s\u00b7Pa at 295 K and a feed pressure of 224 kPa. The membranes effectively separated CO2\/CH4 mixtures up to 1.7 MPa.",
                "Transient, isothermal photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) was combined with isotope labeling and temperature-programmed desorption and oxidation to directly identify reaction pathways and intermediates for the room-temperature PCO of ethanol on TiO2. The intermediates identified are acetaldehyde, acetic acid (acetate), formaldehyde, and formic acid (formate). The \u03b1-carbons of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were labeled with13C so that the reaction pathway of each carbon could be followed. For each molecule, the \u03b1-carbon preferentially oxidized to CO2as the two-carbon species were sequentially oxidized. Ethanol forms acetaldehyde, which either desorbs or oxidizes through at least two parallel pathways, only one of which involves acetic acid. Part of the ethanol reacts on the surface through the pathway: acetaldehyde \u2192 acetic acid \u2192 CO2+formaldehyde \u2192 formic acid \u2192 CO2. The remaining ethanol \u2026",
                "Organic\/water mixtures are separated at ambient temperature and pressure by pervaporation through a silicalite zeolite membrane supported on the inner surface of a porous stainless-steel cylindrical tube. Methanol, ethanol and acetone were preferentially separated from aqueous solutions. For methanol\/water separations, a relatively constant separation factor between 11 and 14 was obtained over a wide range of methanol feed concentrations. Total mass fluxes of 1 to 2.7 kg\/(m2 h) were obtained. Water and methanol permeances were independent of methanol feed concentration, except at low concentrations. Pervaporation has a higher separation factor than expected for vapor-liquid equilibrium separation. The highest separation factor obtained for acetone\/water was 255 at an acetone feed concentration of 0.8 wt% with an acetone flux of 0.20 kg\/(m2 h). The highest acetone flux of 0.95 kg\/(m2 h) was obtained \u2026",
                "Accurate values of activation energies were measured by flash desorption methods without assumptions about preexponential factors, reaction orders or specific reaction mechanisms. The activation energies were determined by two methods; one method employed a relationship for the shift in peak temperature with change in heating rate, and the other utilized the change in peak amplitude with shift in peak temperature for different heating rates. Agreement between the two methods was excellent. A series of flash curves at different heating rates were obtained for the CO2 and CO products from DCOOH flash decomposition following adsorption on Ni (110) at 37\u00b0C. Adsorbed DCOOH decomposed autocatalytically with an activation energy of 26.6 kcal\/mol to form CO2 and D2. Carbon monoxide formation from DCOOH decomposition, which corresponded identically to CO desorption from this surface, showed a first \u2026",
                "A SAPO\u201034 membrane, prepared by seeding SAPO crystals, has a CO 2\/CH 4 separation selectively of 115 and a CO 2 permeance of 4.0\u00d7 10\u20107 mol m\u20132 s\u20131 Pa\u20131. SAPO\u201034 membranes separate CO 2\/CH 4 mixtures at a feed pressure of 7 MPa.",
                "ZSM\u20105 zeolite membranes with reproducible properties were prepared by in\u2010situ synthesis on porous \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010alumina tubular supports and characterized by XRD, SEM and electron microprobe analysis. Single\u2010gas permeances for H2, CH4, N2, CO2, n\u2010butane, and i\u2010butane increase over some temperature range, but some gases exhibit maxima or minima. The highest ideal selectivities at room temperature are 299 for N2\/SF6, 392 for H2\/n\u2010butane, and 2,820 for H2\/i\u2010butane. These membranes can separate n\u2010butane\/i\u2010butane, H2\/n\u2010butane and H2\/i\u2010butane mixtures. All n\u2010butane\/i\u2010butane separation selectivities have maxima as a function of temperature and are higher than ideal selectivities because n\u2010butane inhibits i\u2010butane permeation. Thus, separation is not by size selectivity, but is due to pore blocking. Temperature depenencies of single\u2010gas permeances and separation selectivities depend strongly on \u2026"

(2005) from Cambridge University. After a postdoctoral fellowship at UC Berkeley, he joined the Physics faculty in 1969. He received the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1983. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of London, the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Institute of Physics (UK). He has been a Sloan Foundation Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow and a Miller Professor. In 1987, he was named California Scientist of the Year and was awarded the Fritz London Prize for research in low-temperature physics. In 1998, he received the American Physical Society\u2019s Joseph F. Keithley Award for Advances in Measurement Science and, in 1999, the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Comstock Prize for Physics. He was awarded the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 2004, and was the UC Berkeley Faculty Research Lecturer in 2005. One of my main interests is in the development, noise limitations and applications of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs).\u00a0 I am particularly intrigued by quantum-limited detectors and measurements. \u00a0Applications include reading out superconducting \u201cqubits\u201d, novel schemes for ultra-low-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and searching for the axion. The dc SQUID consists of two Josephson tunnel junctions-weak links-connected in parallel on a superconducting loop.\u00a0 The SQUID is generally operated with a bias current that generates a voltage across the junctions.\u00a0 When the magnetic flux in the SQUID is increased, this voltage oscillates with a period of one flux quantum, F0\u00ba h\/2e.\u00a0 By detecting changes in the voltage with an amplifier, one can detect typically 10-6F0 in a unit bandwidth.\u00a0 This exquisite sensitivity, enables one to use SQUIDs for many different applications. One application is to determine the flux state of a flux quantum bit (\u201cqubit\u201d), which consists of a superconducting ring interrupted by three nanometer-sized Josephson junctions.\u00a0 The qubit has two macroscopic quantum states, flux \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d, corresponding to anticlockwise and clockwise supercurrents in the loop, respectively.\u00a0 Just as for the ammonia molecule, the qubit is described by a two-well potential, and the two degenerate states can be superposed to form symmetric and antisymmetric quantum states with distinct energies.\u00a0 The quantum state of the qubit is measured with a SQUID.\u00a0 We have recently coupled together two such qubits, and shown that we can control the coupling energy-and even reverse its sign.\u00a0 Such control greatly simplifies the implementation of qubits in a quantum computer.\u00a0 Current work is focused on nondissipative readout schemes that should enable us to perform quantum nondemolition measurements. The basis of the nondissipative readout is a dispersive scheme based on the \u201cmicrostrip SQUID amplifier\u201d (MSA).\u00a0 This device involves a spiral coil deposited on-but insulated from-the SQUID so as to form a microstrip resonator.\u00a0 The signal to be amplified is applied between one end of the coil and the body of the SQUID.\u00a0 When the signal frequency corresponds to a standing wave resonance in the microstrip the signal is efficiently coupled to the SQUID, yielding a gain of typically 30 dB at 1 GHz.\u00a0 Furthermore, when the MSA is cooled to millikelvin temperatures, its noise approaches the quantum noise limit determined by the uncertainty principle.\u00a0 The so-called \u201cdispersive\u201d readout of a flux qubit relies on the fact that the inductance of the SQUID in the zero-voltage state is a nonlinear function of the flux threading the loop.\u00a0 Thus, when a capacitor is connected across the SQUID to form an oscillator, the resonant frequency depends on the flux state of a qubit.\u00a0 By applying radio-frequency current pulses to the resonant circuit and detecting the amplitude of the resulting voltage with an MSA, one can measure the flux in a qubit with a detector that remains in the superconducting state. NMR and MRI are of great importance in the spectroscopy of chemical compounds and the imaging of people.\u00a0 Typically, NMR and MRI are performed at frequencies ranging from tens to hundreds of megahertz.\u00a0 We have developed techniques based on SQUID detection that enable us to detect NMR signals at frequencies as low as tens of hertz, with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio.\u00a0 We are exploiting this technique in a variety of novel NMR and MRI experiments, including the demonstration of MRI in zero magnetic field and the first observation of the polarization of nuclei by means of a rotating magnetic field.\u00a0 In particular, we have developed a novel MRI system capable of obtaining high-resolution images in a magnetic field of 0.132 mT, four orders of magnitude lower than that used in conventional MRI.\u00a0 At this low frequency, we have demonstrated that there is a much greater differentiation of tissue types-for example, tumors and normal tissue-than in high-field MRI.\u00a0 This observation suggests that there may well be clinical applications of this technique.
