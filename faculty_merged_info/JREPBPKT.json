                "Systems with a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition in the vicinity of room temperature are useful for devices. Adjusting the ferroelectric transition temperature (T c) is traditionally accomplished by chemical substitution\u2014as in Ba x Sr 1-x TiO 3, the material widely investigated for microwave devices in which the dielectric constant (\u03b5 r) at GHz frequencies is tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field 1, 2. Heterogeneity associated with chemical substitution in such films, however, can broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees 3, which is detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance. An alternative way to adjust T c in ferroelectric films is strain 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we show that epitaxial strain from a newly developed substrate can be harnessed to increase T c by hundreds of degrees and produce room-temperature ferroelectricity in strontium titanate, a material that is not normally ferroelectric at \u2026",
                "Biaxial compressive strain has been used to markedly enhance the ferroelectric properties of BaTiO3 thin films. This strain, imposed by coherent epitaxy, can result in a ferroelectric transition temperature nearly 500\u00b0C higher and a remanent polarization at least 250% higher than bulk BaTiO3 single crystals. This work demonstrates a route to a lead-free ferroelectric for nonvolatile memories and electro-optic devices.",
                "Nanoscale resistive switching devices, sometimes termed memristors, have recently generated significant interest for memory, logic and neuromorphic applications. Resistive switching effects in dielectric-based devices are normally assumed to be caused by conducting filament formation across the electrodes, but the nature of the filaments and their growth dynamics remain controversial. Here we report direct transmission electron microscopy imaging, and structural and compositional analysis of the nanoscale conducting filaments. Through systematic ex-situ and in-situ transmission electron microscopy studies on devices under different programming conditions, we found that the filament growth can be dominated by cation transport in the dielectric film. Unexpectedly, two different growth modes were observed for the first time in materials with different microstructures. Regardless of the growth direction, the \u2026",
                "The newly discovered 39-K superconductor MgB 2 1 holds great promise for superconducting electronics. Like the conventional superconductor Nb, MgB 2 is a phonon-mediated superconductor 2, with a relatively long coherence length 3. These properties make the prospect of fabricating reproducible uniform Josephson junctions, the fundamental element of superconducting circuits, much more favourable for MgB 2 than for high-temperature superconductors. The higher transition temperature and larger energy gap 4, 5 of MgB 2 promise higher operating temperatures and potentially higher speeds than Nb-based integrated circuits. However, success in MgB 2 Josephson junctions has been limited because of the lack of an adequate thin-film technology 6, 7. Because a superconducting integrated circuit uses a multilayer of superconducting, insulating and resistive films, an in situ process in which MgB 2 is formed \u2026",
                " The broad spectrum of electronic and optical properties exhibited by oxides offers tremendous opportunities for microelectronic devices, especially when a combination of properties in a single device is desired. Here we describe the use of reactive molecular\u2010beam epitaxy and pulsed\u2010laser deposition to synthesize functional oxides, including ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, and materials that are both at the same time. Owing to the dependence of properties on direction, it is often optimal to grow functional oxides in particular directions to maximize their properties for a specific application. But these thin film techniques offer more than orientation control; customization of the film structure down to the atomic\u2010layer level is possible. Numerous examples of the controlled epitaxial growth of oxides with perovskite and perovskite\u2010related structures, including superlattices and metastable phases, are shown. In addition to \u2026",
                "Single-phase, insulating Bi1\u2212xLaxFeO3 (BLFOx, x=0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40) ceramics were prepared. An obvious phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic phase was observed near x=0.30. It is found that the phase transition destructs the spin cycloid of BiFeO3 (BFO), and therefore, releases the locked magnetization and enhances magnetoelectric interaction. As a result, improved multiferroic properties of the BLFO0.30 ceramics with remnant polarization and magnetization (2Pr and 2Mr) of 22.4\u03bcC\u2215cm2 and 0.041emu\u2215g, respectively, were established.",
                "Nanoscale metal inclusions in or on solid-state dielectrics are an integral part of modern electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, capacitors, metamaterials and memory devices. The properties of these composite systems strongly depend on the size, dispersion of the inclusions and their chemical stability, and are usually considered constant. Here we demonstrate that nanoscale inclusions (for example, clusters) in dielectrics dynamically change their shape, size and position upon applied electric field. Through systematic in situ transmission electron microscopy studies, we show that fundamental electrochemical processes can lead to universally observed nucleation and growth of metal clusters, even for inert metals like platinum. The clusters exhibit diverse dynamic behaviours governed by kinetic factors including ion mobility and redox rates, leading to different filament growth modes and structures in memristive \u2026"
