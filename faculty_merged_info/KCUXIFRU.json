                "Four fossil floras ranging in age from the mid Miocene to the early Pleistocene from the eastern Siwaliks near Darjeeling and in Arunachal Pradesh (AP) were compared taxonomically and subjected to a CLAMP (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program) analysis using a new calibration dataset that includes sites from India, southern China and Thailand and high resolution gridded climate data. Two lower Siwalik mid Miocene floras yielded almost the same values suggesting mean annual temperatures (MATs) of 25.4 and 25.3 \u00b0C \u00b1 2.8 \u00b0C (all uncertainties \u00b1 2 sigma) with warm month mean temperatures (WMMTs) of 28.4 and 27.8 \u00b1 3.39 \u00b0C and cold month mean temperatures (CMMTs) of 17.9 and 21.3 \u00b1 4 \u00b0C. Precipitation estimates have high uncertainties but suggest a weak monsoon with growing season precipitations of 242 \u00b1 92 cm for Darjeeling and 174 \u00b1 92 cm for AP. Leaves from the middle Siwalik \u2026",
                "A morpho-taxonomic study of leaf remains from the upper part of the Siwalik succession of sediments (Kimin Formation; upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene) of Papumpare district, Arunachal Pradesh, India, revealed 23 species representing 20 genera belonging to 15 angiosperm families. The recovered fossil leaves are comparable to modern Bambusa tulda Roxb. (Poaceae), Mangifera indica Linn., Dracontomelum mangiferum Blume (Anacardiaceae); Chonemorpha macrophylla G. Don (Apocynaceae); Pongamia pinnata (L) Pierre., Millettia pachycarpa Benth., Dalbergia rimosa Roxb., Millettia extensa (Fabaceae); Macaranga denticulata Muell. Arg., Croton caudatus Geisel. (Euphorbiaceae); Combretum decandrum Roxb. (Combretaceae); Dysoxylum procerum Hiern. (Meliaceae); Dipterocarpus sp. Gaertn.f. (Dipterocarpaceae); Actinodaphne angustifolia Nees., Actinodaphne obovata Blume., Lindera \u2026",
                "Diverse palynomorphs and phytoliths recovered from coprolites of ovi-caprids (sheep, goat) collected from Yang-Hai Tomb at Xinjiang Province, China, have been used to elucidate the dietary pattern of ancient livestock and to reconstruct the paleovegetation and paleoclimate of this part of northwest China ca. 2500 14C yr BP. Palynological and phytolith data suggest that a rich dry temperate vegetation prevailed in the area during the said period. Climatic conditions and grassland vegetation type of the area are explored using phytolith indices.",
                "A morpho-taxonomical study on the plant megafossils comprising mostly leaf and few fruit impressions from the Lower Siwalik sedimnts of the Kathgodam area, Nainital District of Uttranchal, India has revealed 27 species representing 25 genera belonging to 18 families of angiosperms and one family of pteridophytes. The recorded genera, viz., Alpinia, Pachira, Cupania, Holarrena, Derris and Sarcosperma in the present assemblage are new to the Tertiary flora of the Indian subcontinent. With the addition of presently recovered species, the megafloral assemblage of the Kathgodam area now comprises 67 species belonging mostly to angiospermous families. Most of the extant species resembling the fossil taxa are distributed in the tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests of north-east India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaya and adjoining areas, which suggest that warm humid climate with higher rainfall prevailed in the area during middle Miocene time. The analysis of present day distribution of modern comparable taxa of the fossils shows that about 90% of the taxa disappeared from the area and has migrated to other suitable regions where they have found favourble conditions for their survival. It indicates positive change in climate after middle Miocene. In relation to climate, the physiognomic characters of the leaf impressions have also been analysed.",
                "Five distinct transient warming (hyperthermal) events (Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM], H1\/ETM2\/ELMO, H2, I1, and I2), marked by negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) occurred between Late Paleocene and Early Eocene (~ 56 to 52 Ma) interval. However, not many records of either the PETM or definitive Early Eocene Hyperthermals (EEHs) are yet available from terrestrial realm in the tropics except two neo-tropical sections of Colombia and Venezuela (Jaramillo et al., 2010). Therefore, response of the tropical biosphere to these warming events is not very well known. Here we report high resolution carbon isotope (\u03b413C) chemostratigraphy, biomarker, calcareous nannofossils, and pollen data from the Cambay shale Formation of Western India (paleolatitude ~ 5\u00b0S), which show complete preservation of all the above CIE events including the PETM, hitherto unknown from tropical terrestrial \u2026",
                "While documenting the vegetation response to climatic changes in mountains, the use of grass phytolith data relies on the ability of phytolith assemblages or indices to differentiate the elevationally stratified vegetation zones. To infer the potential and limitations of grass phytolith assemblages and indices to reconstruct vegetation vis-\u00e0-vis climate in the Himalayan mountain regions, we analyzed phytolith assemblages from 66 dominant grasses and 153 surface soils from four different forest types along the c. 130\u20134000 m a.s.l. elevation gradients in the Darjeeling and Arunachal Himalayas. Grass short cell phytolith assemblages from modern grasses show significant variability with rising elevation. To test the reliability of the above observation, phytoliths from the soil samples were subjected to linear discriminant analysis (DA). DA classified 85.3% and 92.3% of the sites to their correct forest zones in the Darjeeling \u2026",
                "Seven fossil leaves with cuticle described here were collected from the lower, middle and upper strata of Siwalik (middle Miocene\u2013lower Pleistocene) sediments of Arunachal Pradesh, India. A detailed comparison of the cuticular analysis of the fossils and their living relatives indicate that these fossil species belong to Dysoxylum raptiensis, Macaranga cf. denticulata, Calophyllum suraikholensis, Combretum prechinense, Actinodaphne palaeoangustifolia, Shorea siwalika and Dipterocarpus koilabasensis. Among these fossil species C. prechinense has been described as a new species. The present day distribution of the modern equivalent taxa of the fossils, structural features and the micro-morphological features of the fossil leaves together with epiphyllous fungal remains collectively indicate the prevalence of a warm humid tropical climate in this area during Siwalik sedimentation. The cuticular micro \u2026",
                "Grasses are among the most abundant, diverse and ecologically important group of plants; their number and diversity make them a significant part of the ecosystem. The characteristic presence of opaline silica in grasses makes them a valuable tool in environmental reconstruction over other groups of vascular plants. Fifty grass taxa belonging to four different subfamilies viz., Panicoideae, Chloridoideae, Ehrhartoideae and Bambusoideae of family Poaceae were collected for phytolith analysis from different eco-vegetational zones viz., swampy mangrove or intertidal mangrove zone, tidal mangrove zone, true mangrove decline zone, zone for colonization of non-littoral species and xerophytic non-mangrove species and dry evergreen forest zone along the coastal regions of the Indian part of the Sunderbans. Predominant phytolith assemblages recovered from these grass taxa might help in discriminating different \u2026",
                "In order to quantify the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability for a monsoon dominated agrarian based Indian socio-economy, we used combined high resolution \u03b4 13 C, total organic carbon (TOC), sediment texture and environmental magnetic data of the samples from a~ 3 m deep glacial outwash sedimentary profile from the Sikkim Himalaya. Our decadal to centennial scale records identified five positive and three negative excursions of the ISM since last~ 13 ka. The most prominent abrupt negative ISM shift was observed during the termination of the Younger Dryas (YD) between~ 11.7 and 11.4 ka. While, ISM was stable between~ 11 and 6 ka, and declined prominently between 6 and 3 ka. Surprisingly, during both the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice age (LIA) spans, ISM was strong in this part of the Himalaya. These regional changes in ISM were coupled to southward shifting in mean position of \u2026",
                "Pollen, phytoliths and \u03b4 13C signatures of soil organic matter from two fluvial sedimentary sequences of the Darjeeling foothill region, eastern Himalayas are used to portray palaeoclimatic oscillations and their impact on regional plant communities over the last \u223c50 ka. Quantitative palaeoclimate estimation using coexistence approach on pollen data and other proxies indicate significant oscillations in precipitation during the late part of MIS 3 (46.4\u201325.9 ka), early and middle part of MIS 2 (25.9\u201315.6 ka), and 5.4 to 3.5 ka. Middle to late MIS 3 (ca 46.4\u201331 ka.) was characterized by a comparatively low monsoonal activity and slightly higher temperature than that during ca 31 ka onwards. Simultaneous expansion of deciduous trees and chloridoid grasses also imply a drier and warmer phase. Between 31 and 22.3 ka (late MIS 3 to mid-MIS 2), higher precipitation and a slightly cooler temperature led to an increase in \u2026"

Silicon Carbide The wide bandgap semiconductor silicon carbide (SiC) is a fascinating material. Our interest is in the electronic and chemical properties of field-effect devices. We have developed a catalytic gate hydrogen sensor with millisecond response at 600\u00b0C, capable of continuous operation for several months in a power plant. Our group is studying the hydrogen-mediated defect dynamics at interfaces in refractory metal\/oxide\/SiC field effect structures. Sensitive, rugged sensors capable of quantitatively monitoring the gaseous products of combustion systems are needed for reducing polluting emissions and improving energy efficiency. Photo (above): Optical image of SiC sensor chip with an array of Pt\/SiO 2 \/SiC devices (200 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcm) operating at 630\u00b0C in air. Fire Research The ability to remotely identify the chemical components in structural fires is an invaluable tool for first responders. We are developing a data base of the chemical burn signature of the major constituents present in structural fires. These \u201cchemical fingerprints\u201d obtained from well controlled thermal decomposition experiments as the material pyrolysis and eventually self combusts, will enable remote, wireless fire monitoring. Optics Metal-halide clusters such as Mo 6 Cl 12 and related compounds emit a bright red (600-900\u00a0nm) phosphorescence when pumped with UV photons. The emission is efficiently quenched by oxygen molecules in their ground state, 3 O 2 . The specificity of these indicators to oxygen is determined by quantum mechanics. We are studying the photophysics and material properties of MoCl clusters immobilized in sol-gel and polymer matrices for gas and liquid phase sensing. Applications of our fiber optic sensor include monitoring dissolved oxygen in outdoor fish hatcheries over several months and oxygen containing gas mixtures from 20 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C. A spatially (~\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcm) and temporally resolved (~1\u00a0s) oxygen imaging technique for bio-medical applications is under development."
