                "Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157\u2013165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.00049.001",
                "The dramatic advances in the efficiency of digital computers during the past decade have provided hydrologists with a powerful tool for numerical modeling of groundwater systems. Introduction to Groundwater Modeling presents a broad, comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts and applications of computerized groundwater modeling. The book covers both finite difference and finite element methods and includes practical sample programs that demonstrate theoretical points described in the text. Each chapter is followed by problems, notes, and references to additional information. This volume will be indispensable to students in introductory groundwater modeling courses as well as to groundwater professionals wishing to gain a complete introduction to this vital subject. Systematic exposition of the basic ideas and results of Hilbert space theory and functional analysis Great variety of applications that are not available in comparable books Different approach to the Lebesgue integral, which makes the theory easier, more intuitive, and more accessible to undergraduate students",
                "We developed a hydrogen arc discharge exfoliation method for the synthesis of graphene sheets (GSs) with excellent electrical conductivity and good thermal stability from graphite oxide (GO), in combination with solution-phase dispersion and centrifugation techniques. It was found that efficient exfoliation and considerable deoxygenation of GO, and defect elimination and healing of exfoliated graphite can be simultaneously achieved during the hydrogen arc discharge exfoliation process. The GSs obtained by hydrogen arc discharge exfoliation exhibit a high electrical conductivity of \u223c2 \u00d7 103 S\/cm and high thermal stability with oxidization resistance temperature of 601 \u00b0C, which are much better than those prepared by argon arc discharge exfoliation (\u223c2 \u00d7 102 S\/cm, 525 \u00b0C) and by conventional thermal exfoliation (\u223c80 S\/cm, 507 \u00b0C) with the same starting GO. These results demonstrate that this hydrogen arc \u2026",
                "Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel 1. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton 2, 3, 4. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin 5, 6, 7. Here we \u2026",
                "Despite abundant expression of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in brain, the regulation and behavioral role of DNA methylation remain poorly understood. We found that Dnmt3a expression was regulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic cocaine use and chronic social defeat stress. Moreover, NAc-specific manipulations that block DNA methylation potentiated cocaine reward and exerted antidepressant-like effects, whereas NAc-specific Dnmt3a overexpression attenuated cocaine reward and was pro-depressant. On a cellular level, we found that chronic cocaine use selectively increased thin dendritic spines on NAc neurons and that DNA methylation was both necessary and sufficient to mediate these effects. These data establish the importance of Dnmt3a in the NAc in regulating cellular and behavioral plasticity to emotional stimuli.",
                "We report a novel phase of carbon possessing a monoclinic C 2\/m structure (8 atoms\/cell) identified using an ab initio evolutionary structural search. This polymorph, which we call M-carbon, is related to the (2\u00d7 1) reconstruction of the (111) surface of diamond and can also be viewed as a distorted (through sliding and buckling of the sheets) form of graphite. It is stable over cold-compressed graphite above 13.4 GPa. The simulated x-ray diffraction pattern and near K-edge spectroscopy are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data [WL Mao et al., Science 302, 425 (2003)] on overcompressed graphite. The hardness and bulk modulus of this new carbon polymorph are calculated to be 83.1 and 431.2 GPa, respectively, which are comparable to those of diamond.",
                " math5 is a murine orthologue of atonal, a bHLH proneural gene essential for the formation of photoreceptors and chordotonal organs in Drosophila. The expression ofmath5 coincides with the onset of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) differentiation. Targeted deletion of math5 blocks the initial differentiation of 80% of RGCs and results in an increase in differentiated amacrine cells. Furthermore, the absence ofmath5 abolishes the retinal expression of brn-3b and the formation of virtually all brn-3b-expressing RGCs. These results imply that math5 is a proneural gene essential for RGC differentiation and that math5 acts upstream to activatebrn-3b-dependent differentiation processes in RGCs.",
                "This study examines the effect of age on risk tolerance. The life-cycle investment hypothesis is tested using the 1983-89 panel of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Household wealth is defined as the sum of human capital and net worth. Risk tolerance is measured by the ratio of risky assets to total wealth. Risk tolerance increases with age when other variables are controlled.",
                "In IR and Raman spectral studies, the congestion of the vibrational modes in the C\u2212H stretching region between 2800 and 3000 cm-1 has complicated spectral assignment, conformational analysis, and structural and dynamics studies, even with quite a few of the simplest molecules. To resolve these issues, polarized spectra measurement on a well aligned sample is generally required. Because the liquid interface is generally ordered and molecularly thin, and sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) is an intrinsically coherent polarization spectroscopy, SFG-VS can be used for discerning details in vibrational spectra of the interfacial molecules. Here we show that, from systematic molecular symmetry and SFG-VS polarization analysis, a set of polarization selection rules could be developed for explicit assignment of the SFG vibrational spectra of the C\u2212H stretching modes. These polarization \u2026",
