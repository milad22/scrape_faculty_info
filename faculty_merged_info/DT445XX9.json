                "We report on a search for particle dark matter with the XENON100 experiment, operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso for 13 months during 2011 and 2012. XENON100 features an ultralow electromagnetic background of (5.3\u00b10.6)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 events\/(keV ee\u00d7 kg\u00d7 day) in the energy region of interest. A blind analysis of 224.6 live days\u00d7 34 kg exposure has yielded no evidence for dark matter interactions. The two candidate events observed in the predefined nuclear recoil energy range of 6.6\u201330.5 keV nr are consistent with the background expectation of (1.0\u00b10.2) events. A profile likelihood analysis using a 6.6\u201343.3 keV nr energy range sets the most stringent limit on the spin-independent elastic weakly interacting massive particle\u2013nucleon scattering cross section for weakly interacting massive particle masses above 8 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 2\u00d7 10\u2212 45 cm 2 at 55 GeV\/c 2 and 90% confidence level."

What are the fundamental properties of dark matter? What is the absolute mass of neutrinos? Are there sterile types of neutrinos? We develop extremely low background particle detectors and advanced data analysis techniques to address these open questions experimentally. Current Projects: XENON1T and XENONnT: located at Gran Sasso National Underground Laboratory in Italy.\u00a0XENON1T is the world\u2019s first tonne-scale dark matter detector using the liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC) technology and so far the most sensitive WIMP dark matter detector. XENONnT is the upgrade of XENON1T and is set to start operation in 2020. Future Projects: DARWIN : the ultimate WIMP dark matter detector to probe down to the \u201cneutrino floor\u201d and also a multi-purpose observatory for neutrinos and other astrophysics sources. Former Projects: XENON10 and XENON100: pioneering experiments demonstrating the advantages of LXeTPC technology for dark matter search.
