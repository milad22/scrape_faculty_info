                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Comprehensive sets of production and decay measurements are combined. The decay channels include,,,,, and pairs. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 at 7 and up to 19.7 at 8. From the high-resolution and channels, the mass of the Higgs boson is determined to be. For this mass value, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay channels and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal relative to the standard model expectation is at the measured mass. The couplings of the Higgs boson are probed \u2026",
                "Observation of the diphoton decay mode of the recently discovered Higgs boson and measurement of some of its properties are reported. The analysis uses the entire dataset collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2011 and 2012 LHC running periods. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1 at and 19.7 at 8. A clear signal is observed in the diphoton channel at a mass close to 125 with a local significance of, where a significance of is expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The mass is measured to be\\(124.70\\pm 0.34\\,\\text {GeV}\\,= 124.70\\pm 0.31\\,\\text {(stat)}\\,\\pm 0.15\\,\\text {(syst)}\\,\\,\\text {GeV}\\,\\), and the best-fit signal strength relative to the standard model prediction is.

                "An inclusive search for supersymmetric processes that produce final states with jets and missing transverse energy is performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 11.7 fb\u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In this search, a dimensionless kinematic variable, \u03b1 T, is used to discriminate between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. The search is based on an examination of the number of reconstructed jets per event, the scalar sum of transverse energies of these jets, and the number of these jets identified as originating from bottom quarks. No significant excess of events over the standard model expectation is found. Exclusion limits are set in the parameter space of simplified models, with a special emphasis on both compressed-spectrum scenarios and direct or gluino \u2026",
                "A search has been made for events containing an energetic jet and an imbalance in transverse momentum using a data sample of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. This signature is common to both dark matter and extra dimensions models. The data were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb\u2212 1. The number of observed events is consistent with the standard model expectation. Constraints on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross sections are determined for both spin-independent and spin-dependent interaction models. For the spin-independent model, these are the most constraining limits for a dark matter particle with mass below 3.5 GeV\/c 2, a region unexplored by direct detection experiments. For the spin-dependent model, these are the most stringent constraints over the 0.1\u2013200 GeV\/c 2 mass range. The constraints on the Arkani \u2026",
                "New sets of parameters (\u201ctunes\u201d) for the underlying-event (UE) modelling of the pythia 8, pythia6 and herwig++ Monte Carlo event generators are constructed using different parton distribution functions. Combined fits to CMS UE proton\u2013proton () data at and to UE proton\u2013antiproton () data from the CDF experiment at lower, are used to study the UE models and constrain their parameters, providing thereby improved predictions for proton\u2013proton collisions at 13. In addition, it is investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons are presented of the UE tunes to \u201cminimum bias\u201d(MB) events, multijet, and Drell\u2013Yan ( lepton-antilepton+ jets) observables at 7 and 8, as well as predictions for MB and UE observables at 13 \u2026",
                "A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W-boson pair at the LHC is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb\u2212 1 and 19.4 fb\u2212 1 collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at= 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4.3 standard deviations for m H= 125.6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m H= 125.6 GeV is times the standard model expectation. The spin-parity J P= 0+ hypothesis is favored against a narrow resonance with J P= 2+ or \u2026",
                "The transverse momentum spectra of charged particles have been measured in pp and PbPb collisions at  by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In the transverse momentum range p T=5\u201310 GeV\/c, the charged particle yield in the most central PbPb collisions is suppressed by up to a factor of 7 compared to the pp yield scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon\u2013nucleon collisions. At higher p T, this suppression is significantly reduced, approaching roughly a factor of 2 for particles with p T in the range p T=40\u2013100 GeV\/c.",
                "A measurement of the single-top-quark t-channel production cross section in pp collisions at TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC is presented. Two different and complementary approaches have been followed. The first approach exploits the distributions of the pseudorapidity of the recoil jet and reconstructed top-quark mass using background estimates determined from control samples in data. The second approach is based on multivariate analysis techniques that probe the compatibility of the candidate events with the signal. Data have been collected for the muon and electron final states, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.17 and 1.56 fb\u2212 1, respectively. The single-top-quark production cross section in the t-channel is measured to be 67. 2\u00b16. 1 pb, in agreement with the approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order standard model prediction. Using the standard model electroweak couplings, the \u2026",
                "Measurements of the jet energy calibration and transverse momentum resolution in CMS are presented, performed with a data sample collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36pb\u2212 1. The transverse momentum balance in dijet and \u03b3\/Z+ jets events is used to measure the jet energy response in the CMS detector, as well as the transverse momentum resolution. The results are presented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-based approach, the``Jet-Plus-Track''approach, which improves the measurement of calorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks, and the``Particle Flow''approach, which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in the event, prior to the jet clustering, based on information from all relevant subdetectors."
