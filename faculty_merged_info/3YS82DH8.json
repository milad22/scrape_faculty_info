                "The ground-state energy, electron density, and related properties of ordinary matter can be computed efficiently when the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the density is approximated semilocally. We propose the first meta-generalized-gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that is fully constrained, obeying all 17 known exact constraints that a meta-GGA can. It is also exact or nearly exact for a set of \u201cappropriate norms,\u201d including rare-gas atoms and nonbonded interactions. This strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA achieves remarkable accuracy for systems where the exact exchange-correlation hole is localized near its electron, and especially for lattice constants and weak interactions."
