                "We have reanalyzed data for the proposed moving group associated with \u03b2 Pictoris in order to determine if the group (or part of it) is real and, if so, to derive an improved age estimate for \u03b2 Pic. By using new, more accurate proper motions from PPM and Hipparcos and a few new radial velocities, we conclude that on kinematic grounds, most of the proposed members of the moving group are not, in fact, associated with \u03b2 Pic. However, two M dwarfs--or three, actually, since one of them is a nearly equal mass binary--have space motions that coincide with that of \u03b2 Pic to within 1 km s-1 with small error bars. Based on a color-magnitude diagram derived from accurate photometry and Hipparcos parallaxes, these two possible proper-motion companions to \u03b2 Pic are very young; we derive an age of~ 20 Myr by comparison with theoretical tracks from F. D'Antona & I. Mazzitelli. In fact, the proposed \u03b2 Pic companions \u2026",

                "In a deep X-ray survey of the Pleiades open cluster, we use the ROSAT High Resolution Imager to explore a region of the cluster formerly surveyed with the PSPC. These new observations substantially improve upon both the sensitivity and the spatial resolution for this region of the Pleiades, allowing us to detect 18 cluster members not detected before and 16 members not included in the catalogs used in previous surveys. The high sensitivity of the present observations permits us to obtain more stringent upper limits for 72 additional members and also provides sufficient numbers of stars to enable us to explore the dependence of L_x on stellar rotation for the slow rotators of the Pleiades. Using the new high sensitivity X-ray observations and the recent rotational measurements we discuss the activity-rotation relationship in the Pleiades solar type stars. We also present new photometric observations of optical \u2026",

We find that 13% of these A stars have been reported as Vega\u2010like stars in the literature and that the ages of this subset run the gamut from very young (50 Myr) to old (1 Gyr), with no obvious age difference compared to those of field A stars. We clearly show that the fractional IR luminosity decreases with the ages of Vega\u2010like stars.",

                "We report the discovery of large-amplitude, periodic X-ray emission from the O7 V star \u03b8 1 Orionis C, the central star of the Orion Nebula. Ten ROSAT HRI snapshots of the Trapezium cluster taken over the course of 21 days show that the count rate of \u03b8 1 Ori C varies from 0.26 to 0.41 counts s-1 with a clear 15 day period. The soft X-ray variations have the same phase and period as H\u03b1 and He II \u03bb4686 variations reported by Stahl et al. and are in antiphase with the C IV and Si IV ultraviolet absorption features. We consider five mechanisms which might explain the amplitude, phase, and periodicity of the X-ray variations:(1) colliding-wind emission with an unseen binary companion,(2) coronal emission from an unseen late-type pre-main-sequence star,(3) periodic density fluctuations,(4) absorption of magnetospheric X-rays in a corotating wind, and (5) magnetosphere eclipses. The ROSAT data rule out the first three \u2026",
                "We have estimated the ages of eight late\u2010type Vega\u2010like stars by using standard age\u2010dating methods for single late\u2010type stars, e.g., location on the color\u2010magnitude diagram, Li \u03bb6708 absorption, Ca ii H and K emission, X\u2010ray luminosity, and stellar kinematic population. With the exception of the very unusual pre\u2013main\u2010sequence star system HD 98800, all the late\u2010type Vega\u2010like stars are the same age as the Hyades cluster (600\u2013800 Myr) or older."

                "Jean-Pierre Caillault, Professor of Astronomy jpc@uga.edu 706-542-2883 237 Biographical Information PhD, Columbia University , 1985 My research has concentrated primarily on stellar X-ray astronomy, with a special emphasis on stellar clusters (such as the Pleiades) and star-forming regions (like the Trapezium cluster in the Orion Nebula). One of the most important issues that can be addressed through these studies is determining what parameters (e.g., age and mass) most affect the stellar X-ray luminosity function. Mass-dependent spindown timescales give rise to age-dependent distributions of rotational velocities, i.e., rotation seems to be the key. Since the X-ray activity in a late-type star is expected to arise as the result of the magnetic dynamo, a relation between X-ray emission and rotation is not surprising. This research is carried out mostly with data acquired from satellite-borne imaging X-ray telescopes but also requires the use of optical and radio telescope facilities. Another area of interest is the ages of Vega-like stars, since this knowledge may play an important role in understanding whether planetary system formation is common. If the ages of Vega-like stars are all very young, then this suggests that planet formation is common and that the range of dust optical depths is an age indicator; if the ages are spread out over a few hundred Myr, then planetary formation would be determined by random initial conditions.
