Within this field fall the exploration of new materials such as carbon nanotubes and semiconducting nanowires as well as the development of next generation electronic devices. Many of the technologies that impact society today (e.g.\u00a0electronics, magnetics, and photonics) emerged directly from research in condensed matter physics.
