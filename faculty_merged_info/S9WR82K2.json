                "We describe the development, current features, and some directions for future development of the Amber package of computer programs. This package evolved from a program that was constructed in the late 1970s to do Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement, and now contains a group of programs embodying a number of powerful tools of modern computational chemistry, focused on molecular dynamics and free energy calculations of proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Water, DNA, and 3D structure of the genome are our current favorites.  Methods that we devlop help with rational drug design efforts. My philosophy is that among the multitude of models of\r\na complex system that one can build, only the very simple, robust solutions\r\nmay have a chance to represent reality.  Complex solutions with tens of\r\nfitting parameters may sometimes be of great practical use, but often\r\nmisrepresent reality (the geocentric model of the Universe is one such\r\nexample). The same philosophy applies to computational methods we develop: simple, robust solutions are preferred. As with any theoretical work, close\r\ncontact with experimental groups is essential.
