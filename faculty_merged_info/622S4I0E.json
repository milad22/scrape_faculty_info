                "The Skyrmion state in epitaxial B20 FeGe (111) thin films, determined by the topological Hall effect, is greatly extended in the phase diagram to cover all temperatures up to the Curie temperature T C\u2248 271 K and over a wide magnetic field range that includes a zero magnetic field. The properties of the Skyrmion phase can be controlled and manipulated by the film thickness, which has a strong effect on the stabilization of Skyrmions.",
                "Point-contact Andreev reflection measurements reveal that amorphous CoxFe80\u2212xB20 (x=20, 40, and 60) alloys possess spin polarization of as much as 65%, much higher than the values of 43%\u201345% for Co and Fe. This accounts for the high magnetoresistance values in magnetic tunnel junctions incorporating amorphous CoFeB as the ferromagnetic electrodes. The crystallization of the amorphous alloys substantially reduces the spin polarization.",
                "We demonstrate a close relationship between superconductivity and the dimensions of the Fe-Se (Te) tetrahedron in FeSe 0.5 Te 0.5. This is done by exploiting thin film epitaxy, which provides controlled biaxial stress, both compressive and tensile, to distort the tetrahedron. The Se\/Te height within the tetrahedron is found to be of crucial importance to superconductivity, in agreement with the scenario that (\u03c0, \u03c0) spin fluctuations promote superconductivity in Fe superconductors.",
                "We demonstrate a self-consistent and versatile method to determine the relative spin Hall angle \u03b8 SH and spin diffusion length \u03bb SF of selected 5 d metals (Pt, Au, Ta, and W) by thermal spin injection from a common ferromagnetic insulator, yttrium iron garnet, into thin metal films of various thicknesses. The values of \u03b8 SH for Pt and Au are opposite in sign to those of Ta and W. The inverse spin Hall effect voltage depends on spin Hall resistivity, which is the product of \u03b8 SH and electrical resistivity. We also show evidence of magnetic proximity effects including magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect in these 5 d metals, except for Au.",
                "The tunneling magnetoresistance and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in CoFeB(1.1-1.2 nm)\/MgO\/CoFeB(1.2-1.7 nm) junctions were found to be very sensitively dependent on annealing time. During annealing at a given temperature, decay of magnetoresistance occurs much earlier compared to junctions with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Through a rapid thermal annealing study, the decrease of magnetoresistance is found to be associated with the degradation of perpendicular anisotropy, instead of impurity diffusion as observed in common in-plane junctions. The origin of the evolution of perpendicular anisotropy as well as possible means to further enhance tunneling magnetoresistance is discussed.",
                "Although the combinatorial approach has been widely adapted in the search for novel functional materials, 1 the parallel synthesis and high-throughput characterization are still the major obstacles hampering the application to a diversity of materials. Among various parallel synthesis strategies, thin-film deposition combined with physical masks (or photolithography) and solution-based synthetic methods are the most commonly used techniques. 2 In solution-based parallel synthesis, droplets of precursor solutions are laid into predefined microreactors (usually microwells drilled into a ceramic substrate) from microdispensers (usually piezoelectricdriven ejectors). Then, the precursors are mixed and reacted to form a materials library. Through this method, materials libraries including phosphors, catalyst, etc., have been fabricated from solution precursors. 3, 4 Inkjet delivery shows many advantages over other microdispense apparatus, such as nanoliter dispensing capability with high accuracy. 5 However, a significant limitation of the above-mentioned technique is the applicability: only soluble compounds had been used as the precursors. On the other hand, a lot of suspensions have been used with the inkjet technique in ceramic freeforming, 6 fabrication of electronic devices, 7 and functionally graded material. 8 From this point of view, suspensions can be used with inkjet technique in solutionbased parallel synthesis if a universal preparation method of insoluble suspensions can be developed. Evans et al. realized this and published the point of view from philosophy analysis, 9 but to our best knowledge, no materials library was really made from \u2026",
                "We present a systematic investigation of the additional resistance (R E), which is an unavoidable consequence of pseudo-four-probe electrical measurements, on the point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectrum by both modeling and experiments. Instead of considering the total resistance between the two voltage leads across a point contact as a sum of a contact resistance (R C) and a fixed sample resistance (R S), it is essential to treat the total resistance as a sum of the Andreev resistance R AR and the additional resistance R E, which are, respectively, the resistances affected and unaffected by the Andreev reflection process. We show a detailed formalism of taking R E into account in modeling and demonstrate that the PCAR spectrum can be drastically affected by the presence of R E. Experimentally, we have found that not only R E cannot be readily measured or even estimated, it is in fact different for \u2026",
                "Spin-transfer torques (STT) provide a mechanism to alter the magnetic configurations of magnetic heterostructures, a result previously only achieved by an external magnetic field. In granular solids, we demonstrate a new form of STT effect that can be exploited to induce a large spin disorder when combined with a large magnetic field. We have obtained a very large magnetoresistance effect in excess of 400% at 4.2 K in a large magnetic field, the largest ever reported in any metallic systems. The STT characteristics of granular solids differ significantly from those of multilayers, showing no STT effect at low magnetic fields but prominent STT effects at high fields.",
                "Ferrous tris-chelate compounds based on 2-(2\u2032-pyridyl)benzimidazole (pybzim) have been prepared and characterized for studies of spin equilibria in fluid solution and when anchored to the surface of mesoporous nanocrystalline (anatase) TiO2 and colloidal ZrO2 thin films. The solid state structure of Fe(pybzim)3(ClO4)2\u00b7CH3CN\u00b7H2O was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at 110 K to be triclinic, P-1, a = 11.6873(18), b = 12.2318(12), c = 14.723(4) \u00c5, \u03b1 = 89.864(13)\u00b0, \u03b2 = 71.430(17)\u00b0, \u03b3 = 73.788(11)\u00b0, V = 1907.1(6) \u00c53, Z = 2, and R = 0.0491. The iron compound has a meridional FeN6 distorted octahedral geometry with bond lengths expected for a low-spin iron center at 110 K. The visible absorption spectra of Fe(pybzim)32+ and Fe(pymbA)32+, where pymbA is 4-(2-pyridin-2-yl-benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzoic acid, in methanol solution were dominated by metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT \u2026",
                "The superconducting gap in FeAs-based superconductor SmFeAs(O1\u2212xFx) (x = 0.15 and 0.30) and the temperature dependence of the sample with x = 0.15 have been measured by Andreev reflection spectroscopy. The intrinsic superconducting gap is independent of contacts while many other \u201cgap-like\u201d features vary appreciably for different contacts. The determined gap value of 2\u0394 = 13.34 \u00b1 0.47 meV for SmFeAs(O0.85F0.15) gives 2\u0394\/kBTC = 3.68, close to the BCS prediction of 3.53. The superconducting gap decreases with temperature and vanishes at TC, in a manner similar to the BCS behavior but dramatically different from that of the nodal pseudogap behavior in cuprate superconductors."

Professor sxh311@miami.edu (305) 284-7112 C203 My research interests lie in experimental condensed matter physics, specializing in nanoscale physics, strongly correlated systems, new materials, spintronic phenomena, and superconductivity. My recent focuses have been on the fabrication of new materials, especially thin films, multilayer structures with built-in nanostructures, and on the studies of their unusual magnetic, transport (charge, spin, and heat), and superconducting properties. These studies not only reveal the novel physics, and when situation permits, also advance technological applications. Some of my other studies also include novel bulk materials, such as B20 Skyrmion single crystals. The research areas my group will pursue in the coming years include topological spin textures, pure spin current phenomena, spin caloritronics, and topological insulators.
