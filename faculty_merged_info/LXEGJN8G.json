                "We described the carryover of Strelkovimermis spiculatus (Poinar and Camino) (Nematoda: Mermithidae) from mosquito larvae, the primary site of maturation, to adults. We analyzed the survival time of male and female Aedes albifasciatus (Macquart) (Diptera: Culicidae) parasitized by S. spiculatus, the time of emergence of nematodes from adult mosquitoes, and the state of parasitism in the same mosquito cohorts during the immature stages. Mosquito larvae with single and multiple parasitism (up to 11 parasites) were observed. The mortality of mosquito larvae and adults was produced in all cases where at least one mermithid emerged. The mortality of S. spiculatus showed an increasing trend in mosquito larvae with larger numbers of nematodes and was higher in larvae parasitized by eight or more nematodes. Maximum survival of parasitized adult females of Ae. albifasciatus was 38 days, while non \u2026",
                "Dormancy is a developmental arrest in arthropods, in response to unfavorable conditions in temporally varying environments. In Aedes aegypti, the supposed inability of eggs to inhibit hatching has been used to explain the restriction of this species to tropical and subtropical regions. However, the geographic range of Ae. aegypti is constantly expanding towards temperate regions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the ability of Ae. aegypti individuals from a temperate region (Buenos Aires City, Argentina) to enter photoperiod induced dormancy. To this end, we exposed both the parental generation and the eggs to short-day (SD: 10L:14D) and long-day (LD: 14L:10D) photoperiods, and studied the temporal variation in egg hatching. The experiment consisted of 28 treatment combinations of three factors: parental photoperiod (SD or LD), egg storage photoperiod (SD or LD), and age of eggs (14, 28, 42 \u2026"

Balseiro\u2019s Prize for the best Professor in Physics of Instituto Balseiro of Year (1997) I work in theoretical physics with emphasis in strongly interacting electron systems. My research tools combine analytical methods with numerical techniques for describing static and dynamical properties of many-body systems. I am particularly interested in the novel states of matter that are realized in frustrated quantum materials. Quantum magnetism offers the simplest playground (purely bosonic systems) to study the multiplicity of exotic quantum states matter, ranging from multipolar orderings to spin liquids, that can emerge at low energies out of very simple competing interactions. I believe frustration is also a guiding principle for finding novel quantum states of matter in itinerant systems (metals), such unconventional superconductivity. For this reason, we are currently study the role of frustration in strongly correlated metals. The dynamical response of interacting quantum systems offers an invaluable tool for detecting proximity to novel quantum states of matter, as well as for characterizing these states. Developing experimental and theoretical tools for studying dynamical responses of quantum materials is crucial for the development of our field. One of my current areas of research is the development of field theory techniques for computing dynamical responses of quantum magnets with strong quantum fluctuations. We are also developing new numerical algorithms for extending semi-classical approaches to itinerant systems. These tools are essential for interpreting neutron scattering data obtained at the Spallation Neutron Source of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). This is an example of the kind of synergistic activities that we are currently developing at Shull Wollan center (a joint institute for neutron sciences).
