D., University of California, Los Angeles, 2008 Office: SERF 414 Phone: 858-534-3316 saw@physics.ucsd.edu Shelley Wright is an observational and experimental astrophysicist. Wright focuses on understanding how galaxies and supermassive black holes form and evolve over cosmic time using innovative instrumentation with integral field spectrograph coupled with adaptive optics. Wright also focuses on designing and building near-infrared and optical astronomical instrumentation. Wright has led instrument programs at Lick and Keck Observatory, and is the Project Scientist for the first light instrument IRIS for the Thirty Meter Telescope project."
