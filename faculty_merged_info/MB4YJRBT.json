                "This paper presents the results of a functional-integral approach to the dynamics of a two-state system coupled to a dissipative environment. It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the\" spin-boson\" problem;(2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem;(3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space \u2026",
                "It is shown that, in the context of an idealized \u2018\u2018macroscopic quantum coherence\u2019\u2019experiment, the predictions of quantum mechanics are incompatible with the conjunction of two general assumptions which are designated \u2018\u2018macroscopic realism\u2019\u2019and \u2018\u2018noninvasive measurability at the macroscopic level.\u2019\u2019The conditions under which quantum mechanics can be tested against these assumptions in a realistic experiment are discussed.",
                "In biological and chemical electron transfer, a nuclear reaction coordinate is coupled to other nuclear and\/or \u2018\u2018solvent\u2019\u2019 coordinates. This coupling, or friction, if strong enough, may substantially slow down motion along the reaction coordinate, and thus vitiate the assumption of electron transfer being nonadiabatic with respect to the nuclei. Here, a simple, fully quantum mechanical model for electron transfer using a one mode treatment which incorporates this coupling is studied. Path integral methods are used to study the dependence of the reaction rate on friction, and the limits of the moderate and the high friction are analyzed in detail. The first limit will prevail if the reaction coordinate is, e.g., an underdamped nuclear vibration, whereas the second limit will prevail if it corresponds to a slow or diffusive degree of freedom. In the high\u2010friction limit, the reaction rate is explicitly shown to vary between the nonadiabatic \u2026",
                "Spin systems can undergo quantum tunneling with classically degenerate minima. In some cases, the amplitudes from symmetry-related trajectories can interfere destructively, quenching the tunneling rate. This quenching need not be related to Kramers' degeneracy. This is shown by studying a problem (relevant to macroscopic quantum phenomena in ferromagnetic particles) with biaxial symmetry and an external field. The tunnel splitting is found to oscillate with the field, vanishing at certain values. Spin path integrals are used to prove Kramers' theorem, and an extension in which a subset of the energy levels is systematically doubly degenerate.",
                "The question of how to deal with inefficient detectors in actual experiments of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen type is studied. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for compatibility with local realism of data collected in experiments with two settings of each detector, without making auxiliary assumptions about undetected events. For the conventional experiment with particles in the singlet state (or its photon analogue), the data predicted by the quantum theory do not violate this condition unless the quantum efficiency of the detectors exceeds 83%.",

                "The Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin and instanton answers for the tunnel splitting of the ground state in a symmetric double-well potential are both reduced to an expression involving only functionals of the potential, without the need for solving any auxilliary problems. This formula is applied to simple model problems. The prefactor for the splitting in the textbook by Landau and Lifshitz is amended so as to apply to the ground and low lying excited states.",
                "The effect of magnetoelastic dissipation upon the tunneling and coherence of the total magnetization in small (\u223c 100 A\u030a) single-domain ferromagnetic particles is investigated. Such tunneling would be an example of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon. It is shown that the dissipation has a super-Ohmic spectral density, J (\u03c9)\u223c \u03c9 3, and that the dissipation is weak for reasonable material parameters. Corrections to the rates, and the damping rate for coherent oscillations are obtained. A key feature is the inclusion of the elastic waves in the medium surrounding the particle."

He develops the theory of magnetization dynamics of single molecule nanomagnets, where the spin is observed to tunnel through as many as twenty fundamental quanta. Current projects in this area include quantum phenomena at the single molecule level, as well as the collective and slow relaxational dynamics of many coupled molecules as in a solid. Garg is also engaged in developing semiclassical methods for spin. These methods are of practical utility for many physical systems, including the molecular nanomagnets mentioned above, but they are also of intrinsic formal value. They are often based on the spin coherent state path integral, which poses mathematical challenges not encountered with Feynman's original path integral.
