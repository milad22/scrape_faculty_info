                " Purpose. Low molecular weight branched polyethylenimine (LMW-PEI) was synthesized and studied as a DNA carrier for gene delivery with regard to physico-chemical properties, cytotoxicity, and transfection efficiency. Methods. The architecture of LMW-PEI, synthesized by acid catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of aziridine was characterized by size exclusion chromatography in combination with laser light scattering and 13C-NMR-spectroscopy. In vitro cytotoxic effects were quantified by LDH and MTT assay and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The potential for transgene expression was monitored in ECV304 cells using luciferase driven by a SV40 promoter as reporter gene system. Results. LMW-PEI (Mw 11\u2032900 D) with a low degree of branching was synthesized as a DNA carrier for gene delivery. In contrast to high molecular weight polyethylenimines (HMW-PEI \u2026",
                "Fabricating active materials into specific macrostructures is critical in the pursuit of high electro-catalytic activity. Herein we demonstrate that a three-dimensional (3D) architecture of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) significantly reduced the onset potential, yielded high current density at small overpotentials, and showed outstanding stability in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction.",
                "Major aspects related to lithium deposition in lithium-ion and lithium metal secondary batteries are reviewed. For lithium-ion batteries with carbonaceous anode, lithium deposition may occur under harsh charging conditions such as overcharging or charging at low temperatures. The major technical solutions include: (1) applying electrochemical models to predict the critical conditions for deposition initiation; (2) preventions by improved battery design and material modification; (3) applying adequate charging protocols to inhibit lithium deposition. For lithium metal secondary batteries, the lithium deposition is the inherent reaction during charging. The major technical solutions include: (1) the use of mechanistic models to elucidate and control dendrite initiation and growth; (2) engineering surface morphology of the lithium deposition to avoid dendrite formation via adjusting the composition and concentration of the \u2026",
                "After optic nerve injury in mature mammals, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are normally unable to regenerate their axons and undergo delayed apoptosis. However, if the lens is damaged at the time of nerve injury, many RGCs survive axotomy and regenerate their axons into the distal optic nerve. Lens injury induces macrophage activation, and we show here that factors secreted by macrophages stimulate RGCs to regenerate their axons. When macrophages were activated by intravitreal injections of Zymosan, a yeast cell wall preparation, the number of RGC axons regenerating into the distal optic nerve was even greater than after lens injury. These effects were further enhanced if Zymosan was injected 3 d after nerve crush. In a grafting paradigm, intravitreal Zymosan increased the number of RGCs that regenerated their axons through a 1.5 cm peripheral nerve graft twofold relative to uninjected controls and \u2026",
                "The role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in adult hearts is unknown; also unclear is how lncRNA modulates nucleosome remodelling. An estimated 70% of mouse genes undergo antisense transcription 1, including myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7), which encodes molecular motor proteins for heart contraction 2. Here we identify a cluster of lncRNA transcripts from Myh7 loci and demonstrate a new lncRNA\u2013chromatin mechanism for heart failure. In mice, these transcripts, which we named myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (Myheart, or Mhrt), are cardiac-specific and abundant in adult hearts. Pathological stress activates the Brg1\u2013Hdac\u2013Parp chromatin repressor complex 3 to inhibit Mhrt transcription in the heart. Such stress-induced Mhrt repression is essential for cardiomyopathy to develop: restoring Mhrt to the pre-stress level protects the heart from hypertrophy and failure. Mhrt antagonizes the \u2026",
                "TiO2-coated activated carbon (AC) grain (TiO2\/AC) was prepared through hydrolytic precipitation of TiO2 from Tetrabutylorthotitanate and following heat treatment. The TiO2\/AC was characterized by BET, SEM, XRD and optical absorption spectroscopy. The samples were employed as catalysts for methyl orange photocatalytic oxidation degradation in aqueous suspension, used as probe reaction. The kinetics of methyl orange photodegradation was analyzed. The results indicate that BET surface area of TiO2-coated ACs decreased drastically in comparison with the original AC with increasing TiO2 coatings by more than 1 doped cycle. Nano-TiO2 particles were dispersed on the AC with the size of 20\u201340 nm. Crystalline TiO2 doped onto AC was from anatase to rutile with increase of heat-treatment temperature. The TiO2\/AC was shown high photoactivity for the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) dyestuff in \u2026",
                "We investigated the electron-pairing mechanism in an iron-based superconductor, iron selenide (FeSe), using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Tunneling conductance spectra of stoichiometric FeSe crystalline films in their superconducting state revealed evidence for a gap function with nodal lines. Electron pairing with twofold symmetry was demonstrated by direct imaging of quasiparticle excitations in the vicinity of magnetic vortex cores, Fe adatoms, and Se vacancies. The twofold pairing symmetry was further supported by the observation of striped electronic nanostructures in the slightly Se-doped samples. The anisotropy can be explained in terms of the orbital-dependent reconstruction of electronic structure in FeSe.",
                "When lithium-ion batteries age with cycling, the battery capacity decreases and the resistance increases. The aging mechanism of different types of lithium-ion batteries differs. The loss of lithium inventory, loss of active material, and the increase in resistance may result in battery aging. Generally, analysis of the battery aging mechanism requires dismantling of batteries and using methods such as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. These methods may permanently damage the battery. Therefore, the methods are inappropriate for the battery management system (BMS) in an electric vehicle. The constant current charging curves while charging the battery could be used to get the incremental capacity and differential voltage curves for identifying the aging mechanism; the battery state-of-health can then be estimated. This method can be potentially used in the BMS for online diagnostic and prognostic \u2026"
