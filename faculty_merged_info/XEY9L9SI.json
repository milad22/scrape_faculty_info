                "When the first edition of this book was published in 1992, supply chain management as an idea was still in its infancy and relatively few companies had made it a priority. The same was true for logistics management, although its precursor, distribution management, was increasingly being recognised as important both in terms of cost and for its potential impact on sales.In the intervening years from the first to the fourth edition, many things have happened. Firstly, there is now a much greater understanding of the role that supply chain management plays in creating competitive advantage. Whereas previously the focus was primarily tactical with a concern for optimising costs, now there is much more of a strategic focus with the emphasis on value creation and delivery. The second major change is the recognition that supply chain management is not just an extension of logistics management, but rather that it is about managing relationships across the complex networks that today's supply chains have become. A third significant change over that period is that the business environment has become a lot more volatile and hence less predictable. This transition from a relatively stable world to one that is much more turbulent requires supply chains to be capable of changing rapidly to meet changed circumstances. These changes are reflected in the additional material included in this new edition. Thus complexity management and the challenge of making the transition from a forecast-driven to a demand-driven business model are given greater emphasis. As ever, I have been greatly influenced in my thinking by the ideas and contributions of colleagues \u2026",
                "Relationship Marketing is as much about keeping customers as it is about getting them in the first place. The aim is to provide unique value in chosen markets, sustainable over time. Relationship Marketing emphasizes both quality and customer service and how these can be managed towards closing the Y quality gap\" between what customers expect and what they get. The authors explore the process of developing and implementing relationship strategies and in so doing, signal a radical shift in marketing practice involving firstly, the coordination of external (customer) markets and secondly, collaboration within internal (staff) markets in order to get the marketing mix right.",
                "In today\u2019s uncertain and turbulent markets, supply chain vulnerability has become an issue of significance for many companies.  As supply chains become more complex as a result of global sourcing and the continued trend to \u2018leaning-down\u2019, supply chain risk increases.  The challenge to business today is to manage and mitigate that risk through creating more resilient supply chains.",
                "Turbulent and volatile markets are becoming the norm as life cycles shorten and global economic and competitive forces create additional uncertainty. The risk attached to lengthy and slow-moving logistics \u201cpipelines\u201d has become unsustainable, forcing organizations to look again at how their supply chains are structured and managed. This paper suggests that the key to survival in these changed conditions is through \u201cagility,\u201d in particular by the creation of responsive supply chains. A distinction is drawn between the philosophies of \u201cleanness\u201d and \u201cagility,\u201d and the appropriate application of these ideas is discussed.",
                "In recent years the issue of supply chain risk has been pushed to the fore, initially by fears related to possible disruptions from the much publicised \u201cmillennium bug\u201d. Y2K passed seemingly without incident, though the widespread disruptions caused by fuel protests and then Foot and Mouth Disease in the UK, and by terrorist attacks on the USA have underlined the vulnerability of modern supply chains. Despite increasing awareness among practitioners, the concepts of supply chain vulnerability and its managerial counterpart supply chain risk management are still in their infancy. This paper seeks to identify an agenda for future research and to that end the authors go on to clarify the concept of supply chain risk management and to provide a working definition. The existing literature on supply chain vulnerability and risk management is reviewed and compared with findings from exploratory interviews undertaken to \u2026"

Caltech, 1993-. ; Galaxy Evolution, Intergalactic Medium, and Experimental Astrophysics Our laboratory is engaged in an experimental and observation program to image emission from the intergalactic medium (IGM), the location of most of the baryons in the Universe. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how gas from the IGM flows into the halos of galaxies, the \"Circum-Galactic Medium\" (CGM), and how it flows out of galaxies back into the CGM and IGM. The cosmic evolution of galaxies is driven by the flow of gas into and out of them. Our long-term goals are: 1. To understand the history of cosmic gas accretion into galaxies; 2. The feedback of energy, gas, and heavy elements into the IGM from galactic scale and black hole winds; 3. To locate galaxies within the baryonic cosmic web; and 4. Using these observations combined with numerical simulations, to assemble a predictive theory for baryonic structure formation. We are developing new instruments that are designed to image the very low surface brightness emission from the IGM and CGM, \"Dim Matter\". These instruments include the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager, the Keck Cosmic Web Imager and its red arm the Keck Cosmic Reionization Mapper, and the FIREBALL-2 and HALO balloon and explorer. Using these instruments we will be able to detect and map CGM and IGM emission from the epoch of Reionization (z=8) to the local Universe (z=0). For the space UV, we need to develop new, high efficiency photon counting detectors and wide field imaging spectrometers to enable detecting the local cosmic web in emission. We are developing techniques for interpreting the data from these instruments, and observational techniques to unravel the star formation history in galaxies. One of our principal goals is to relate the star formation history of galaxies with the properties of their halos (CGM). Credit:  NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/C. Martin (Caltech)\/M.
