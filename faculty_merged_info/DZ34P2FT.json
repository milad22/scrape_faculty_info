                "iPads are becoming popular as 1:1 devices in many classrooms, enabling teachers to implement pedagogies that will enhance student learning. Such mobile tools offer many affordances which can increase student motivation and autonomy. Nevertheless, without a change in pedagogy, they are unlikely to bring about any significant impact on student learning. Using the SAMR model, this initial study of four schools explores the impact of iPads on pedagogy and the changes that were evident. Using multiple data collection techniques, the study has shown that there have been some changes in teachers\u2019 pedagogy that lead to increased collaboration, communication, student self\u2010reliance and the development of authentic experiences. However, more time and professional learning are needed to bring about a transformation in pedagogy across the school.",
                "This paper focuses on student teachers' perceptions of the use of email to support communication between university lecturers and student teachers during their final school experience. Two emerging trends from the 90's have contributed to this study. Firstly, changes have been made to how the practicum is conceptualised, structured and supervised as a result of funding problems and an increased awareness of the constraints associated with traditional practicum programs. Secondly, computer mediated communication has been used increasingly by tertiary institutions for course delivery however the application of ICT to the practicum is still a relatively new area. Our study was guided by the following questions: How can ICT be used most effectively in the practicum? For whom? In what contexts? What is the mode of thinking behind their use?",
                "This paper reports on one aspect of a study which investigated the use of email between student teachers and university lecturers during the final practicum experience in a four year Bachelor of Education pre-service primary teaching course. The paper explores how the nature of electronic communication, together with the students\u2019 perceptions of \u2018university supervision\u2019 and their place in the school setting, affected the level of stress experienced by the student teachers in their placements. Student teacher stress has been reported in the literature as one factor which impedes student teacher learning during the practicum (Zeichner 1980). We argue that ICT has the potential to maximise student teachers\u2019 learning outcomes in the practicum by giving them more control over the learning process, reducing their stress, and enabling them to manage their practicum experience more effectively.",
                "The Australian Government report Teachers for the 21st Century: Making the Difference (DEST, 2000) highlighted that teachers were central to student learning, and that there was a need for professional development for teachers in order for them to adapt to changing student needs. These ideas are not new and have been have been supported by other reports (DEST, 2003) and other researchers (Darling-Hammond, 2000) over many years and much has been written on the qualities of a good teacher (Center for Teaching Quality 2006, DECS 2005). This paper reports on a study that examined student\u2019s opinions about what they believed helped their learning in the classroom environment and how often they believed that they had experienced this in their classes. The information collected was used with teachers to inform professional development activities and directions. The study was done as a two stage process. Initially focus groups of students were asked open ended questions around the idea of what helped them learn in a classroom environment, including what advice would they give to their teachers and what their teachers did that helped them to learn in class. The responses from these groups were then used to develop a list of teaching aspects, where possible student language was used to describe these aspects. The online questionnaire asked the students how important they considered each aspect in a 5 point likert scale, to select their top five most important aspects and to indicate how often each aspect was evident in their classes in general. Of the twenty one aspects that the students had initially identified two were clearly \u2026",
                "South Australian rural and remote schools have been using a variety of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to enhance curriculum opportunities for students whose teachers are at a different campus or different school, or who are out of the school for extended periods of time undertaking courses, such as, Vocational Education and Training (VET). A case study approach was used to identify the strategies that have been implemented by the teachers and to examine the perceptions of students and teachers about the success of these strategies in supporting the learners in a sustainable manner. Some of the strategies that were used to connect the learners and teachers were:(i) video conferencing and interactive whiteboards (IWB) to conduct classes in real time at a local and remote school,(ii) using Moodle as a means of making class material available when and where the student needed it and (iii) connecting to remote sites to do a virtual visit.",

                "Despite the fact that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is valued as a tool for learning, the modelling for preservice teachers of ICT integration in the curriculum areas is often limited. In the recently approved AITSL standards for Initial Teacher Education Programs, knowledge of ICTs is explicitly mentioned in three of the standards. In order to address these requirements, online modules on the use of ICT in teaching and learning were developed as part of the Teaching Teachers for the Future project. This study reports on one university\u2019s use of these modules and the preservice teachers\u2019 responses to them. The modules were used as a component of a methodology course with the students completing an online survey after they had finished the modules. The modules were based around the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) framework (Mishra and Koehler, 2006) and incorporated videos of teachers and their students using ICT, lesson plans and useful ideas for incorporating ICT into the classroom. The preservice teachers were asked about structure and navigability of the modules, what they found to be the most useful aspects and how they could be improved. Overall the preservice teachers were positive about the modules and valued the videos and specific examples that would enable them to more effectively embed technologies in the classroom."
