                "In this paper we calculate the tree level three-point functi ons of Vasiliev\u2019s higher spin gauge theory in AdS 4 and find agreement with the correlators of the free field theory of N massless scalars in three dimensions in the O (N) singlet sector. This provides substantial evidence that Vasiliev theory is dual to the fre e field theory, thus verifying a conjecture of Klebanov and Polyakov. We also find agreement with the critical O (N) vector model, when the bulk scalar field is subject to the alternative boundary condition such that its dual operator has classical dimension 2."
