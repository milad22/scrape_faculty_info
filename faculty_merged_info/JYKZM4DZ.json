                "We report the results of a search for \u03bd e appearance in a \u03bd \u03bc beam in the MINOS long-baseline neutrino experiment. With an improved analysis and an increased exposure of 8.2\u00d7 10 20 protons on the NuMI target at Fermilab, we find that 2 sin\ufeff 2 (\u03b8 23) sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 13)< 0.12 (0.20) at 90% confidence level for \u03b4= 0 and the normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, with a best-fit of 2 sin\ufeff 2 (\u03b8 23) sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 13)= 0.041\u2212 0.031+ 0.047 (0.079\u2212 0.053+ 0.071). The \u03b8 13= 0 hypothesis is disfavored by the MINOS data at the 89% confidence level.",
                "This Letter reports results from the MINOS experiment based on its initial exposure to neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. The rates and energy spectra of charged current \u03bd \u03bc interactions are compared in two detectors located along the beam axis at distances of 1 and 735 km. With 1.27\u00d7 10 20 120 GeV protons incident on the NuMI target, 215 events with energies below 30 GeV are observed at the Far Detector, compared to an expectation of 336\u00b114 events.

                "Measurements of neutrino oscillations using the disappearance of muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI neutrino beam as observed by the two MINOS detectors are reported. New analysis methods have been applied to an enlarged data sample from an exposure of 7.25\u00d7 10 20 protons on target. A fit to neutrino oscillations yields values of| \u0394 m 2|=(2.32\u2212 0.08+ 0.12)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 for the atmospheric mass splitting and sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8)> 0.90 (90% CL) for the mixing angle.

This long-baseline experiment measures neutrino interactions in Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam with a near detector at Fermilab and again 735 km downstream with a far detector in the Soudan Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota. The two detectors are magnetized steel-scintillator tracking calorimeters. They are designed to be as similar as possible in order to ensure that differences in detector response have minimal impact on the comparisons of event rates, energy spectra and topologies that are essential to MINOS measurements of oscillation parameters.

The experiment uses two detectors separated by 734 km to observe a beam of neutrinos created by the Neutrinos at the Main Injector facility at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The data were collected in the first 282 days of beam operations and correspond to an exposure of 1.27\u00d7 10 20 protons on target. Based on measurements in the Near Detector, in the absence of neutrino oscillations we expected 336\u00b114 \u03bd \u03bc charged-current interactions at the Far Detector but observed 215. This deficit of events corresponds to a significance of 5.2 standard deviations. The deficit is energy dependent and is consistent with two-flavor neutrino oscillations according to| \u0394 m 2|= 2.74\u2212 0.26+ 0.44\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2\/c 4 and sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8> 0.87 at 68% confidence level.",

The comparison of these \u03bd e and \u03bd e appearance data at a 735 km baseline with \u03b8 13 measurements by reactor experiments probes \u03b4, the \u03b8 23 octant degeneracy, and the mass hierarchy. This analysis is the first use of this technique and includes the first accelerator long-baseline search for \u03bd \u03bc\u2192 \u03bd e.

In an exposure equivalent to 2.74\u00d7 10 20 protons on target in the upgraded NuMI beam at Fermilab, we observe 6 events in the Far Detector, compared to a background expectation of 0.99\u00b10.11 (syst) events based on the Near Detector measurement. A secondary analysis observes 11 events with a background of 1.07\u00b10.14 (syst). The 3.3 \u03c3 excess of events observed in the primary analysis disfavors 0.1 \u03c0< \u03b4 C P< 0.5 \u03c0 in the inverted mass hierarchy at the 90% CL"
