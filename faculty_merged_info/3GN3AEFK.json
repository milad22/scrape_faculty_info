                "When considering new sensory technologies one should look to nature for guidance. Indeed, living organisms have developed the ultimate chemical sensors. Many insects can detect chemical signals with perfect specificity and incredible sensitivity. Mammalian olfaction is based on an array of less discriminating sensors and a memorized response pattern to identify a unique odor. It is important to recognize that the extraordinary sensory performance of biological systems does not originate from a single element. In actuality, their performance is derived from a completely interactive system wherein the receptor is served by analyte delivery and removal mechanisms, selectivity is derived from receptors, and sensitivity is the result of analyte-triggered biochemical cascades. Clearly, optimal artificial sensory sys-"
