                "The ultrafast dynamics of the bimetallic cluster Ag2Au is investigated by pump\u2013probe negative ion\u2010to\u2010neutral\u2010to\u2010positive ion (NeNePo) spectroscopy. Preparation of the neutral cluster in a highly nonequilibrium state by electron detachment from the mass\u2010selected anion, and subsequent probing of the neutral nuclear dynamics through two\u2010photon ionization to the cationic state, leads to strongly probe\u2010energy\u2010dependent transient cation\u2010abundance signals. The origin of this pronounced time and wavelength dependence of the ionization probability on the femtosecond scale is revealed by ab initio theoretical simulations of the transient spectra. Based on the analysis of underlying dynamics, two fundamental processes involving geometry relaxation from linear to triangular structure followed by ultrafast intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) have been identified and for the first time experimentally \u2026",
                "Ultrathin metal oxide films have attracted considerable interest in recent years as versatile substrate for the design of nanocatalytic model systems. In particular, it has been proposed theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the electronic structure of adsorbates can be influenced by the layer thickness and the stoichiometry, i.e., the type and number of defects, of the oxide film. This has important consequences on the chemical reactivity of the oxide surface itself and of oxide supported metal clusters. It also opens new possibilities to influence and to control chemical reactions occurring at the surface of these systems. The present feature focuses on very recent experiments that illustrate the effects of a proper adjustment of layer thickness and composition of ultrathin MgO(100) films on chemical transformations. On the magnesia surface itself, the photodissociation dynamics of methyl iodide molecules is \u2026",
                "Femtosecond-laser photoemission spectra were obtained from a Mo(100) single crystal surface covered with stoichiometric magnesia thin films of well-defined thickness. Depending on the excitation wavelength and the MgO layer thickness, either one or two photon photoemission was detected at 333 and at 402 nm. This photoemission was assigned to originate from the molybdenum d band states even for 10 monolayers MgO coverage. At 263 nm excitation, however, the photoemission power dependence indicated that the signal contained both contributions from the Mo metal d electrons and from the MgO O2p valence band. While one nominal monolayer of MgO only slightly influenced the photoemission from the molybdenum surface, a considerable reduction of the surface electronic work function was observed for ultrathin magnesia overlayers of 2 to 3 monolayers in thickness. No significant change in the \u2026",
                "A novel experimental approach to the investigation of surface adsorbate reaction dynamics is presented. The direct time-resolved monitoring of the surface reaction transition state and product formation dynamics were accomplished via pump-probe mass spectrometry. As an example, methyl iodide molecules adsorbed at submonolayer coverage on an ultrathin magnesia film on Mo(100) were photoexcited to the A-band by ultrafast laser pulse irradiation. Employing time-delayed multiphoton ionization the dynamics of the dissociative methyl iodide transition state and of the emerging methyl photoproduct could be detected with femtosecond resolution. The reaction times deduced from the temporal evolution of the methyl ion mass signal indicate a strong interaction of the methyl fragment with the substrate surface prior to desorption.",
                "The electronic structure of supported mass-selected Ag3 clusters is analyzed by joint femtosecond photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio theoretical investigations. A wide band gap insulating magnesia ultra-thin film on Mo(100) has been chosen as substrate in order to minimize the electronic interaction between metal clusters and support. After magnesia ultra-thin film preparation no photoemission from the molybdenum substrate is observed anymore, instead very weak two photon photoemission is detected possibly originating from surface or subsurface oxide defect states. Soft-landing deposition of 2 of atomic monolayer equivalents of Ag3 clusters results in the disappearance also of the MgO two photon photoemission signal, while a strong single photon photoemission signal is detected from states located directly below the Fermi level. The theoretical study of structural, electronic and optical \u2026",
                "Femtosecond nuclear dynamics of mass-selected neutral Ag2 and Ag2O2 clusters are investigated with the \u2018negative ion\u2013to neutral\u2013to positive ion\u2019     (NeNePo) technique. For the bare silver dimer, wave packet dynamics occurring in the neutral electronic ground state and in the first excited triplet state are observed after photodetachment from the anion with 3.05 eV photon energy. While the dynamics in the ground state lead to an oscillatory structure in the NeNePo-pump\u2013probe spectra with a vibrational constant of 185 cm\u22121, the dynamics in the triplet state are assigned to a bound\u2013free transition leading to dissociation. Photodetachment from the Ag2O2\u2212 complex results in the desorption of O2. The experimental data clearly show the influence of the desorbing oxygen ligand on the nuclear dynamics of the silver dimer inducing a red shift in the vibrational frequency and an intensity enhancement of the oscillatory \u2026",
                "Wide band gap heterostructures can be accurately fabricated at room temperature to exhibit remarkable electrical properties that facilitate the transfer of electrons across the heterojunction while blocking the transfer of holes. The present investigation focuses on engineering the electronic structure of a TiO2 overlayer on a p-type doped Si(100) substrate by controlling the concentration of TiO2 oxygen vacancies. TiO2 films are deposited on p-Si(100) in an ultrahigh vacuum setup by evaporation of Ti atoms at a constant rate in a variable O2 atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen vacancies and consequently the degree of n-type doping of TiO2 is tuned by controlling the oxygen background pressure during the TiO2 formation. To investigate the electronic structure and the concentration of defects in the TiO2 layer as well as to characterize the TiO2\/p-Si(100) band alignment we used photoelectron spectroscopy \u2026",

                "Methyl iodide represents a classical model for photodissociation and photoreaction of polyatomic molecules. Here, a new experimental approach is used to study the surface photoreaction dynamics of methyl iodide on magnesia and on magnesia supported gold particles employing pump-probe laser mass spectrometry. The adsorption of methyl iodide at submonolayer coverage on these substrates is investigated via temperature programmed desorption spectroscopy. Two distinct desorption peaks of molecular methyl iodide are identified corresponding to molecules bound to magnesia and more strongly bound to gold, respectively. This permits to selectively investigate the photoreaction of methyl iodide on the gold particles by choosing the appropriate temperature at which all molecules have been desorbed from MgO but not yet from the gold particles.

                "Nanosize gold clusters were grown by thermal evaporation on ultrathin magnesia films on Mo(100) and investigated by femtosecond (fs)\u2010laser photoemission spectroscopy. The surface work function in this system was found to increase with increasing nominal gold coverage. Methyl bromide (CH3Br) molecules adsorb molecularly on the magnesia surface as well as on the gold clusters. At sub\u2010monolayer coverage the CH3Br molecules were, however, considerably stronger bound to the gold particles than to the magnesia surface as revealed by temperature programmed desorption spectroscopy. To investigate the photoreaction dynamics of the adsorbate molecules fs\u2010laser pump\u2013probe mass spectrometry was applied. In this new approach the methyl fragment appearance was monitored after photoexcitation of the adsorbed CH3Br with fs time resolution. The transient methyl data revealed that the CH3Br \u2026"

He obtained an ERASMUS scholarship to perform research at Free University of Berlin during his master degree program. After receiving the MS. in Physics, Dr. Vaida obtained a DAAD fellowship for doctoral studies at the Institute of Surface Chemistry and Catalysis at Ulm University, where he earned his PhD degree. Subsequently, he carried out research as a postdoctoral research scholar in the Chemistry Department at University of California, Berkeley. He began as Assistant Professor at University of Central Florida in September 2016. Dr. Vaida uses a state-of-the-art femtosecond laser system in conjunction with a high harmonics generation source and a monochromator to produce femtosecond laser pulses in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. These laser pulses are employed to track the charge carrier dynamics in novel 2D nanostructured materials with time resolution, surface sensitivity, and element specificity. Moreover, pump-probe femtosecond laser mass spectrometry technique in conjunction with extreme ultraviolet soft ionization at the surface is used to study the ultrafast dynamics of molecules attached at solid surfaces such as bond breaking and bond making, with time\u2011, mass-, and energy-resolution. The main goal of this research is to fully monitor and understand the electron and molecular dynamics at the surface of various nanostructured materials that can be used to construct highly efficient photocatalytic and photovoltaic devices.
