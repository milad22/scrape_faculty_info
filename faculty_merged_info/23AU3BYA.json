                "We apply the generalized Lomb\u2013Scargle (LS) periodogram to independently confirm the claim by Sturrock et al.(Astropart Phys 84: 8. https:\/\/doi. org\/10.1016\/j. astropartphys. 2016.07. 005, 2016) of an oscillation at a frequency of 11\/year in the decay rates of from measurements at the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), which however has been disputed by Kossert and Nahle (Astropart Phys 69: 18. https:\/\/doi. org\/10.1016\/j. astropartphys. 2015.03. 003, 2015). For this analysis, we made two different ansatze for the errors. For each peak in the LS periodogram, we evaluate the statistical significance using non-parametric bootstrap resampling. We find using both of these error models evidence for 11\/year periodicity in the data for two of the three samples, but at a lower significance than claimed by Sturrock et al.[1]."
