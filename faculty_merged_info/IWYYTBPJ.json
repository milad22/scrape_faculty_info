He enjoys teaching physics at all levels, from the introductory freshman-level to the most advanced research-oriented course for graduate students. His main research areas are in theoretical nuclear and particle physics. He has published several books and more than 200 articles in physics journals and conference proceedings. Nineteen students have earned their Ph.D. under his supervision. He has been an Associate Editor for Physical Review since 1997. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is a Distinguished University Teaching Professor. Scientific & Professional Societies Fellow, American Physical Society Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science Professor Kapusta does theoretical research on the properties of matter and radiation at high energy-density using relativistic quantum field theory. He is also doing research on the anti-de Sitter - conformal field theory correspondence arising from D-branes in string theory, and on the thermodynamics of nonlocal field theories arising from string theory. The physical theories of primary interest include QCD, effective hadronic field theories, electroweak theory, and nonlocal field theories. The physical environments in which they play a role include high energy nuclear collisions, neutron stars, the early universe, and black holes.
