                "Galactic cosmic rays consist of protons, electrons and ions, most of which are believed to be accelerated to relativistic speeds in supernova remnants 1, 2, 3. All components of the cosmic rays show an intensity that decreases as a power law with increasing energy (for example as E-2.7). Electrons in particular lose energy rapidly through synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, resulting in a relatively short lifetime (about 10 5 years) and a rapidly falling intensity, which raises the possibility of seeing the contribution from individual nearby sources (less than one kiloparsec away) 4. Here we report an excess of galactic cosmic-ray electrons at energies of\u223c 300\u2013800 GeV, which indicates a nearby source of energetic electrons. Such a source could be an unseen astrophysical object (such as a pulsar 5 or micro-quasar 6) that accelerates electrons to those energies, or the electrons could arise from the annihilation \u2026",
                "A precision measurement by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station of the positron fraction in primary cosmic rays in the energy range from 0.5 to 350 GeV based on 6.8\u00d7 10 6 positron and electron events is presented. The very accurate data show that the positron fraction is steadily increasing from 10 to\u223c 250 GeV, but, from 20 to 250 GeV, the slope decreases by an order of magnitude. The positron fraction spectrum shows no fine structure, and the positron to electron ratio shows no observable anisotropy. Together, these features show the existence of new physical phenomena.",
                "A precise measurement of the proton flux in primary cosmic rays with rigidity (momentum\/charge) from 1 GV to 1.8 TV is presented based on 300 million events. Knowledge of the rigidity dependence of the proton flux is important in understanding the origin, acceleration, and propagation of cosmic rays. We present the detailed variation with rigidity of the flux spectral index for the first time. The spectral index progressively hardens at high rigidities.",
                "The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) was flown on the space shuttle Discovery during flight STS-91 (June 1998) in a 51.7\u00b0 orbit at altitudes between 320 and 390 km. A search for antihelium nuclei in the rigidity range 1\u2013140 GV was performed. No antihelium nuclei were detected at any rigidity. An upper limit on the flux ratio of antihelium to helium of< 1.1\u00d7 10\u2212 6 was obtained. The high energy proton, electron, positron, helium, antiproton and deuterium spectra were accurately measured. For each particle and nuclei two distinct spectra were observed: a higher energy spectrum and a substantial second spectrum. Positrons in the second spectrum were found to be much more abundant than electrons. Tracing particles from the second spectra shows that most of them travel for an extended period of time in the geomagnetic field, and that the positive particles (p and e+) and negative ones (e\u2212) originate \u2026",
                "Precision measurements by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station of the primary cosmic-ray electron flux in the range 0.5 to 700 GeV and the positron flux in the range 0.5 to 500 GeV are presented. The electron flux and the positron flux each require a description beyond a single power-law spectrum. Both the electron flux and the positron flux change their behavior at\u223c 30 GeV but the fluxes are significantly different in their magnitude and energy dependence. Between 20 and 200 GeV the positron spectral index is significantly harder than the electron spectral index. The determination of the differing behavior of the spectral indices versus energy is a new observation and provides important information on the origins of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons.",
                "A precision measurement by AMS of the positron fraction in primary cosmic rays in the energy range from 0.5 to 500 GeV based on 10.9 million positron and electron events is presented. This measurement extends the energy range of our previous observation and increases its precision. The new results show, for the first time, that above\u223c 200 GeV the positron fraction no longer exhibits an increase with energy.",
                "We report cosmic\u2010ray proton and helium spectra in energy ranges of 1\u2013120 GeV nucleon\u22121 and 1\u201354 GeV nucleon\u22121, respectively, measured by a flight of the Balloon\u2010borne Experiment with Superconducting Spectrometer (BESS) in 1998. The magnetic rigidity of the cosmic ray was reliably determined by highly precise measurement of the circular track in a uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 1 T. Those spectra were determined within overall uncertainties of \u00b15% for protons and \u00b110% for helium nuclei including statistical and systematic errors.",
                "The primary proton spectrum in the kinetic energy range 0.2 to 200 GeV was measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) during space shuttle flight STS\u201391 at an altitude of 380 km. The complete data set combining three shuttle attitudes and including all known systematic effects is presented.",
                "The energy spectrum of cosmic-ray antiprotons (p's) has been measured in the range 0.18\u20133.56 GeV, based on 458 p's collected by BESS in a recent solar-minimum period. We have detected for the first time a characteristic peak at 2 GeV of p's originating from cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar gas. The peak spectrum is reproduced by theoretical calculations, implying that the propagation models are basically correct and that different cosmic-ray species undergo a universal propagation. Future BESS data with still higher statistics will allow us to study the solar modulation and the propagation in detail and to search for primary p components.",
                "A precision measurement by AMS of the antiproton flux and the antiproton-to-proton flux ratio in primary cosmic rays in the absolute rigidity range from 1 to 450 GV is presented based on 3.49\u00d7 1 0 5 antiproton events and 2.42\u00d7 1 0 9 proton events. The fluxes and flux ratios of charged elementary particles in cosmic rays are also presented. In the absolute rigidity range\u223c 60 to\u223c 500 GV, the antiproton p, proton p, and positron e+ fluxes are found to have nearly identical rigidity dependence and the electron e\u2212 flux exhibits a different rigidity dependence. Below 60 GV, the (p\/p),(p\/e+), and (p\/e+) flux ratios each reaches a maximum. From\u223c 60 to\u223c 500 GV, the (p\/p),(p\/e+), and (p\/e+) flux ratios show no rigidity dependence. These are new observations of the properties of elementary particles in the cosmos."
