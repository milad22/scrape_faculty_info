                "When sufficient electrical power P is dissipated in a thin metal film at millikelvin temperatures, the electrons can be driven far out of thermal equilibrium with the phonons. For uniform power dissipation in a volume \u03a9 we show that the electrons attain a steady-state temperature T e=(P\/\u03a3\u03a9+ T p 5) 1\/5, where T p is the phonon temperature and \u03a3 is a parameter involving the electron-phonon coupling. We have used a sensitive ammeter based on a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to measure the Nyquist current noise in thin films of AuCu as a function of P, and thus inferred T e. We fitted our data to the theory with the single parameter \u03a3, and found good agreement for \u03a3=(2.4\u00b10.6)\u00d7 10 9 Wm\u2212 3 K\u2212 5. When we increased the volume of the resistor by attaching a thin-film cooling fin, there was a much smaller increase in T e for a given power dissipation in the resistor, in qualitative agreement with a \u2026",
                "We present spectroscopic evidence for the creation of entangled macroscopic quantum states in two current-biased Josephson-junction qubits coupled by a capacitor. The individual junction bias currents are used to control the interaction between the qubits by tuning the energy level spacings of the junctions in and out of resonance with each other. Microwave spectroscopy in the 4 to 6 gigahertzrange at 20 millikelvin reveals energy levels that agree well with theoretical results for entangled states. The single qubits are spatially separate, and the entangled states extend over the 0.7-millimeter distance between the two qubits.",
                "To determine the symmetry of the order parameter in superconducting YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 (YBCO), we use a scanning SQUID microscope at 4.2 K to perform independent experiments on six YBCO-Ag-Pb SQUIDs. We find completely unambiguous evidence for a time-reversal-invariant order parameter with a phase shift of \u03c0 between the a and b directions of YBCO. Our results are inconsistent with purely s-wave symmetric pairing and are strongly suggestive of d x 2\u2212 y 2 symmetric pairing in YBCO.",
                "Exploration of new ferroic (ferroelectric, ferromagnetic or ferroelastic) materials continues to be a central theme in condensed matter physics and to drive advances in key areas of technology. Here, using thin-film composition spreads, we have mapped the functional phase diagram of the Ni\u2013Mn\u2013Ga system whose Heusler composition Ni 2 MnGa is a well known ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy. A characterization technique that allows detection of martensitic transitions by visual inspection was combined with quantitative magnetization mapping using scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy. We find that a large, previously unexplored region outside the Heusler composition contains reversible martensites that are also ferromagnetic. A clear relationship between magnetization and the martensitic transition temperature is observed, revealing a strong thermodynamical coupling \u2026",
                "Based on a quantum analysis of two capacitively coupled current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose two fundamental two-qubit quantum logic gates. Each of these gates, when supplemented by single-qubit operations, is sufficient for universal quantum computation. Numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation demonstrate that these operations can be performed with good fidelity.",
                "At temperatures below about 1 K, a series of dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID\u2019s) exhibited an apparent flux noise with a spectral density scaling as 1\/f\u2009\u03b1, where 0.58<\u03b1<0.80. Typically, the magnitude of the noise increased as the temperature was lowered below 1 K, tending to flatten out at low temperatures with a value of 7\u00b13 \u03bc\u03a60Hz\u22121\/2 at 1 Hz that was nearly independent of the parameters and materials of the SQUID\u2019s. Although a large number of hypothetical sources of the noise have been eliminated, the origin remains unidentified."
