                "We present the final report from a series of precision measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a \u03bc=(g\u2212 2)\/2. The details of the experimental method, apparatus, data taking, and analysis are summarized. Data obtained at Brookhaven National Laboratory, using nearly equal samples of positive and negative muons, were used to deduce a \u03bc (Expt)= 11659208.0 (5.4)(3.3)\u00d7 10\u2212 10, where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given, respectively. The combined uncertainty of 0.54 ppm represents a 14-fold improvement compared to previous measurements at CERN. The standard model value for a \u03bc includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes. While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest theoretical uncertainty,\u2248 0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic vacuum polarization. Present standard model evaluations, based on e+ e \u2026",
                "A precise measurement of the anomalous g value, a \u03bc=(g\u2212 2)\/2, for the positive muon has been made at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. The result a \u03bc+= 11 659 202 (14)(6)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 (1.3 ppm) is in good agreement with previous measurements and has an error one third that of the combined previous data. The current theoretical value from the standard model is a \u03bc (SM)= 11 659 159.6 (6.7)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 (0.57 ppm) and a \u03bc (exp)\u2212 a \u03bc (SM)= 43 (16)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 in which a \u03bc (exp) is the world average experimental value.",
                "The anomalous magnetic moment of the negative muon has been measured to a precision of 0.7 ppm (ppm) at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. This result is based on data collected in 2001, and is over an order of magnitude more precise than the previous measurement for the negative muon. The result a \u03bc\u2212= 11 659 214 (8)(3)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 (0.7 ppm), where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic, is consistent with previous measurements of the anomaly for the positive and the negative muon. The average of the measurements of the muon anomaly is a \u03bc (exp)= 11 659 208 (6)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 (0.5 ppm).",

The result a \u03bc+= 11 659 204 (7)(5)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 (0.7 ppm) is in good agreement with previous measurements and has an error about one-half that of the combined previous data.

                "Hypernuclear lifetime and partial decay-rate measurements made at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Alternating Gradient Synchrotron are reported for He \u039b 5 and C \u039b 12. The mesonic and nonmesonic decays are compared to existing weak-interaction calculations. In particular, the nonmesonic reaction \u039bN\u2192 NN is discussed as an example of a nonleptonic weak process for which calculations have been reported using various effective weak Hamiltonians.",
                "Three independent searches for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the positive and negative muons have been performed, using spin precession data from the muon g\u2212 2 storage ring at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Details on the experimental apparatus and the three analyses are presented. Since the individual results on the positive and negative muons, as well as the combined result, d \u03bc=(0.0\u00b10.9)\u00d7 10\u2212 19 e cm, are all consistent with zero, we set a new muon EDM limit,| d \u03bc|< 1.8\u00d7 10\u2212 19 e cm (95% CL). This represents a factor of 5 improvement over the previous best limit on the muon EDM.",

                "The muon anomalous magnetic moment has been measured in a new experiment at Brookhaven. Polarized muons were stored in a superferric ring, and the angular frequency difference, \u03c9 a, between the spin precession and orbital frequencies was determined by measuring the time distribution of high-energy decay positrons. The ratio R of \u03c9 a to the Larmor precession frequency of free protons, \u03c9 p, in the storage-ring magnetic field was measured. We find R= 3.707 220 (48)\u00d7 10\u2212 3. With \u03bc \u03bc\/\u03bc p= 3.183 345 47 (47) this gives a \u03bc+= 1 165 925 (15)\u00d7 10\u2212 9 (\u00b113 ppm), in good agreement with the previous CERN measurements for \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 and of approximately the same precision.",
                "A new measurement of the positive muon\u2019s anomalous magnetic moment has been made at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron using the direct injection of polarized muons into the superferric storage ring. The angular frequency difference \u03c9 a between the angular spin precession frequency \u03c9 s and the angular orbital frequency \u03c9 c is measured as well as the free proton NMR frequency \u03c9 p. These determine R= \u03c9 a\/\u03c9 p= 3.707 201 (19)\u00d7 10\u2212 3. With \u03bc \u03bc\/\u03bc p= 3.183 345 39 (10) this gives a \u03bc+= 11 659 191 (59)\u00d7 10\u2212 10 (\u00b15 ppm), in good agreement with the previous CERN and BNL measurements for \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212, and with the standard model prediction.",
                "We report a measurement of the positive muon lifetime to a precision of 1.0 ppm; it is the most precise particle lifetime ever measured. The experiment used a time-structured, low-energy muon beam and a segmented plastic scintillator array to record more than 2\u00d7 10 12 decays. Two different stopping target configurations were employed in independent data-taking periods. The combined results give \u03c4 \u03bc+(MuLan)= 2 196 980.3 (2.2) ps, more than 15 times as precise as any previous experiment. The muon lifetime gives the most precise value for the Fermi constant: G F (MuLan)= 1.166 378 8 (7)\u00d7 10\u2212 5 GeV\u2212 2 (0.6 ppm). It is also used to extract the \u03bc\u2212 p singlet capture rate, which determines the proton\u2019s weak induced pseudoscalar coupling g P."
