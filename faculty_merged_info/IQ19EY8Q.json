                "The mechanism of sex determination varies substantively among evolutionary lineages. One important mode of genetic sex determination is haplodiploidy, which is used by \u223c20% of all animal species, including >200,000 species of the entire insect order Hymenoptera. In the honey bee Apis mellifera, a hymenopteran model organism, females are heterozygous at the csd (complementary sex determination) locus, whereas males are hemizygous (from unfertilized eggs). Fertilized homozygotes develop into sterile males that are eaten before maturity. Because homozygotes have zero fitness and because common alleles are more likely than rare ones to form homozygotes, csd should be subject to strong overdominant selection and negative frequency-dependent selection. Under these selective forces, together known as balancing selection, csd is expected to exhibit a high degree of intraspecific polymorphism \u2026"

Daniel Green Ph.D. Stanford University 2009 Office: MH 5206 drgreen@physics.ucsd.edu I am broadly interested in cosmology and its intersection with particle physics and quantum field theory. \u00a0My primary interest is the physics of the very early universe, both as the ultimate origin of matter, radiation and structure in the universe and as a window into fundamental physics at energies inaccessible on earth. \u00a0My work ranges from the use of formal tools from quantum field theory to understand the physics of inflation, to exploring new opportunities in data from cosmic microwave background and large scale structure surveys."
