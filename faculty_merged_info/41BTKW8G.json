The Born cross section is measured to be (62.9\u00b11.9\u00b13.7) pb, consistent with the production of the Y (4260). We observe a structure at around 3.9 GeV\/c 2 in the \u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8 mass spectrum, which we refer to as the Z c (3900). If interpreted as a new particle, it is unusual in that it carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium. A fit to the \u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8 invariant mass spectrum, neglecting interference, results in a mass of (3899.0\u00b13.6\u00b14.9) MeV\/c 2 and a width of (46\u00b110\u00b120) MeV.

                "Using 13.5 fb\u2212 1 of e+ e\u2212 annihilation data collected with the CLEO II detector, we have observed a narrow resonance decaying to D s*+ \u03c0 0 with a mass near 2.46 GeV\/c 2. The search for such a state was motivated by the recent discovery by the BaBar Collaboration of a narrow state at 2.32 GeV\/c 2, the D sJ*(2317)+, that decays to D s+ \u03c0 0. Reconstructing the D s+ \u03c0 0 and D s*+ \u03c0 0 final states in CLEO data, we observe peaks in both of the corresponding reconstructed mass difference distributions, \u0394 M (D s \u03c0 0)= M (D s \u03c0 0)\u2212 M (D s) and \u0394 M (D s* \u03c0 0)= M (D s* \u03c0 0)\u2212 M (D s*), both of them at values near 350 MeV\/c 2. We interpret these peaks as signatures of two distinct states, the D sJ*(2317)+ plus a new state, designated as the D sJ (2463)+. Because of the similar \u0394 M values, each of these states represents a source of background for the other if photons are lost, ignored or added. A quantitative accounting of \u2026",

The Born cross sections are measured at 13 energies and are found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of e+ e\u2212\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 but with a different line shape. In the \u03c0\u00b1h c mass spectrum, a distinct structure, referred to as Z c (4020), is observed at 4.02 GeV\/c 2. The Z c (4020) carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium. A fit to the \u03c0\u00b1h c invariant mass spectrum, neglecting possible interferences, results in a mass of (4022.9\u00b10.8\u00b12.7) MeV\/c 2 and a width of (7.9\u00b12.7\u00b12.6) MeV for the Z c (4020), where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic.

We confirm, at 11 \u03c3 significance, the BABAR Y (4260)\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 discovery, make the first observation of Y (4260)\u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J\/\u03c8 (5.1 \u03c3), and find the first evidence for Y (4260)\u2192 K+ K\u2212 J\/\u03c8 (3.7 \u03c3).

A distinct charged structure is observed in the (D D*)\u2213 invariant mass distribution. When fitted to a mass-dependent-width Breit-Wigner line shape, the pole mass and width are determined to be M pole=(3883. 9\u00b11.5 (stat)\u00b14.2 (syst)) MeV\/c 2 and \u0393 pole=(24. 8\u00b13.3 (stat)\u00b111. 0 (syst)) MeV. The mass and width of the structure, which we refer to as Z c (3885), are 2 \u03c3 and 1 \u03c3, respectively, below those of the Z c (3900)\u2192 \u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8 peak observed by BESIII and Belle in \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 final states produced at the same center-of-mass energy. The angular distribution of the \u03c0 Z c (3885) system favors a J P= 1+ quantum number assignment for the structure and disfavors 1\u2212 or 0\u2212.

The production of Y (4260) in initial state radiation (ISR), and its decay into \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8, are confirmed. A good quality fit to our data is obtained with a single resonance.

A data set with an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb\u22121 taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider is used. The cross section is measured with a systematic uncertainty of 0.9%. We extract the pion form factor |F\u03c0|2 as well as the contribution of the measured cross section to the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc.

We also set a 90% confidence upper limit on B (D+\u2192 e+ \u03bd)< 2.4\u00d7 10\u2212 5 which constrains new physics models.",

We use the Dalitz technique to measure the resonant substructure in this final state and clearly observe ten different contributions by fitting for their amplitudes and relative phases. We observe a K*(892)+ \u03c0\u2212 component which arises from doubly Cabibbo suppressed decays or D 0\u2212 D 0 mixing."

Group Webpage elementary particle and nuclear physics (experimental) About Matthew Shepherd Our group has focused on studying the spectrum of light quark mesons using data that are being collected at the BESIII experiment in at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Beijing. and the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab. It is through the study of the spectrum and properties of light quark hadrons we hope to understand the strong interactions that are described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD in the low-energy, non-perturbative regime is fascinating because it explains the confinement of quarks within hadrons. It also predicts the existence of exotic forms of matter such as hybrids, where the gluons binding the quarks in a meson carry additional degrees of freedom, and glueballs, matter composed entirely of gluons. Experimental confirmation of these predicted forms of matter and subsequent measurement of their properties would provide validation of and valuable input to the quantitative understanding of QCD.
