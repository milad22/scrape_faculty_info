                "We report on phase separation in thick InGaN films with up to 50% InN grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition from 690 to 780\u2009\u00b0C. InGaN films with thicknesses of 0.5 \u03bcm were analyzed by \u03b8\u20132\u03b8 x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and selected area diffraction (SAD). Single phase InGaN was obtained for the as-grown films with <28% InN. However, for films with higher than 28% InN, the samples showed a spinodally decomposed microstructure as confirmed by TEM and extra spots in SAD patterns that corresponded to multiphase InGaN."
