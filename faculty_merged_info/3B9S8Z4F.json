                "The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Lead, South Dakota). The LUX cryostat was filled for the first time in the underground laboratory in February 2013. We report results of the first WIMP search data set, taken during the period from April to August 2013, presenting the analysis of 85.3 live days of data with a fiducial volume of 118 kg. A profile-likelihood analysis technique shows our data to be consistent with the background-only hypothesis, allowing 90% confidence limits to be set on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering with a minimum upper limit on the cross section of 7.6\u00d7 1 0\u2212 46 cm 2 at a WIMP mass of 33 GeV\/c 2. We find that the LUX data are in disagreement with low-mass WIMP signal interpretations of the results from several recent direct detection experiments.",
                "We report constraints on spin-independent weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-nucleon scattering using a 3.35\u00d7 1 0 4 kg day exposure of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment. A dual-phase xenon time projection chamber with 250 kg of active mass is operated at the Sanford Underground Research Facility under Lead, South Dakota (USA). With roughly fourfold improvement in sensitivity for high WIMP masses relative to our previous results, this search yields no evidence of WIMP nuclear recoils. At a WIMP mass of 50 GeV c\u2212 2, WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross sections above 2.2\u00d7 10\u2212 46 cm 2 are excluded at the 90% confidence level. When combined with the previously reported LUX exposure, this exclusion strengthens to 1.1\u00d7 10\u2212 46 cm 2 at 50 GeV c\u2212 2.",
                "We report the observation of a narrow state decaying into J\/\u03c8 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 and produced in 220 p b\u2212 1 of p \u0304 p collisions at s= 1.96 T e V in the CDF II experiment. We observe 730\u00b190 decays. The mass is measured to be 3871.3\u00b10.7 (s t a t)\u00b10.4 (s y s t) M e V\/c 2, with an observed width consistent with the detector resolution. This is in agreement with the recent observation by the Belle Collaboration of the X (3872) meson.",
                "The Central Outer Tracker is a large cylindrical drift chamber constructed to replace Collider Detector at Fermilab's original central drift chamber for the higher luminosity expected for Run 2 at the Fermilab Tevatron. The chamber's drift properties are described in the context of meeting the operating requirements for Run 2. The design and construction of the chamber, the front-end readout electronics, and the high-voltage system are described in detail. Wire aging considerations are also discussed.",
                "We report on a search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of Xe 136 with EXO-200. No signal is observed for an exposure of 32.5 kg yr, with a background of\u223c 1.5\u00d7 10\u2212 3 kg\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 keV\u2212 1 in the\u00b11 \u03c3 region of interest. This sets a lower limit on the half-life of the neutrinoless double-beta decay T 1\/2 0 \u03bd \u03b2 \u03b2 (Xe 136)> 1.6\u00d7 10 25 yr (90% CL), corresponding to effective Majorana masses of less than 140\u2013380 meV, depending on the matrix element calculation.",
                "Many extensions of the standard model of particle physics suggest that neutrinos should be Majorana-type fermions\u2014that is, that neutrinos are their own anti-particles\u2014but this assumption is difficult to confirm. Observation of neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2), a spontaneous transition that may occur in several candidate nuclei, would verify the Majorana nature of the neutrino and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. Recent searches carried out with 76 Ge (the GERDA experiment) and 136 Xe (the KamLAND-Zen and EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory)-200 experiments) have established the lifetime of this decay to be longer than 10 25 years, corresponding to a limit on the neutrino mass of 0.2\u20130.4 electronvolts. Here we report new results from EXO-200 based on a large 136 Xe exposure that represents an almost fourfold increase from our earlier published data sets. We have improved \u2026"
