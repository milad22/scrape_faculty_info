Chemical Physics, University of Goettingen, Germany, 5\/1999   Description of Research  Summary Statement of Research Interests  Professor Vilesov researches molecules and molecular aggregates in helium droplets. His current research project includes finding and studying superfluids other then helium.  This challenging research is aimed at addressing a number of long-standing and intriguing questions to provide deep insights into the microscopic origins of superfluidity: How is it possible to detect superfluidity in droplets and what does it even mean, when most of the known phenomena are macroscopic and not obviously applicable to nanometer size droplets? How many atoms are needed for a fluid to become superfluid? Can hydrogen clusters be superfluid? \r\n\r\nProfessor Vilesov is also investigating of formation of atomic and molecular clusters at ultralow temperature in helium droplets.
