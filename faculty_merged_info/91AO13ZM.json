                "As a neutron star is formed by the collapse of the iron core of a massive star, its Kelvin-Helmholtz evolution is characterized by the release of gravitational binding energy as neutrinos.

                "The dynamics and statistical mechanics of the quark-hadron phase transition are explored using the bag model and the known spectrum of hadronic states. We compute the maximum amplitude for isothermal baryon number density fluctuations to emerge from this phase transition and their effects on primordial nucleosynthesis, as a function of the coexistence temperature (or bag constant) and the fractional volume of the universe which will remain in quark-gluon plasma when the release of latent heat no longer compensates the cooling due to expansion. For values of the bag constant, B<(260 MeV) 4, it is possible to find a pressure, temperature, and baryon-chemical-potential equilibrium between the quark-gluon phase and the hadron phase. We calculate the difference in baryon number concentration between these phases. This difference in baryon number concentration may lead to isothermal baryon density fluctuations. For B>(260 MeV) 4 phase equilibrium is not possible for temperatures below 300 MeV. Thus any differences in baryon concentration are small. In the extreme but interesting case of a Hagedorn limiting hadronic temperature and large bag constant we even find that the QCD vacuum energy can produce a mini-inflationary epoch. We discuss computations of the primordial nucleosynthesis yields corresponding to our estimates of the maximum baryon density fluctuations in a universe with Q= 1 in baryons. We find that 4He, 3He, and deuterium are within observed constraints for a large part of the parameter space. However, 7Li is overproduced. Within the parameter space for an Q= 1 universe we'find only a very small \u2026",

                "We study the quark-hadron transition in the early Universe and compute the amplitude of isothermal baryon-number fluctuations that emerge from this transition along with their effects on primordial nucleosynthesis. We find that such fluctuations are a natural consequence of a first-order phase transition occurring in the strongly interacting system. Fluctuation-generating mechanisms are discussed. We estimate the nucleation rate and derive the mean separation between fluctuations. It is shown that the amplitude of the fluctuations depends sensitively on the phase coexistence temperature T c and on the baryon transmission probability \u03a3 h at the phase boundary. For realistic values of \u03a3 h and T c the fluctuations are large and have a significant effect on primordial nucleosynthesis yields. With these fluctuations the limit on the baryonic contribution to \u03a9 depends primarily on what is taken to be the primordial Li 7 \u2026",
                "We describe a numerical method for calculating the (3+ 1)-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics of a coalescing neutron-star binary system. The relativistic field equations are solved at each time slice with a spatial three-metric chosen to be conformally flat. Against this solution to the general relativistic field equations, the hydrodynamic variables and gravitational radiation are allowed to respond. The gravitational radiation signal is derived via a multipole expansion of the metric perturbation to the hexadecapole (l= 4) order including both mass and current moments and a correction for the slow-motion approximation. Using this expansion, the effect of gravitational radiation on the system evolution can also be recovered by introducing an acceleration term in the matter evolution. In the present work we illustrate the method by applying this model to evaluate various orbits of two neutron stars with a \u2026",
                "We use heavy element nucleosynthesis from supernovae to probe the mixing of \u03bd e with \u03bd \u03c4 (or \u03bd \u03bc) possessing cosmologically significant masses (1 to 100 eV). We conclude that the \u03bd \u03c4 (\u03bd \u03bc)-\u03bd e vacuum mixing angle must satisfy sin 2 2\u03b8< 10\u2212 5, in order to ensure that r-process heavy elements can be produced in neutrino-heated supernova ejecta. Mixing at a level exceeding this limit precludes r-process nucleosynthesis in this site.",
                "The scientific literature is rich with studies of non-standard primodial nucleosynthesis. We review a number of these variants on the simplest standard big bang (SBB) nucleosynthesis model and discuss some of the impact these studies have had on cosmology and particle physics. Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the earliest probes of the universe, and non-standard nucleosynthesis models allow for an exploration of the range of conditions which might have prevailed during the first few minutes. In particular, nonstandard models often allow for a larger range of conditions to be present in the early universe than those allowed by the SBB while satisfying observational constraints such as the inferred primordial isotopic abundances and the number of neutrino species derived from recent e+e\u2212 collider experiments. By considering alternatives to the SBB we can also determine the model dependence of the \u2026",

                "We present calculations of r\u2010process nucleosynthesis in neutrino\u2010driven winds from the nascent neutron stars of core\u2010collapse supernovae. A full dynamical reaction network for both the \u03b1\u2010rich freezeout and the subsequent r\u2010process is employed. The physical properties of the neutrino\u2010heated ejecta are deduced from a general relativistic model in which spherical symmetry and steady flow are assumed. Our results suggest that proto\u2013neutron stars with a large compaction ratio provide the most robust physical conditions for the r\u2010process. The third peak of the r\u2010process is well reproduced in the winds from these \u201ccompact\u201d proto\u2013neutron stars even for a moderate entropy,  , and a neutrino luminosity as high as \u223c1052 ergs s\u22121. This is due to the short dynamical timescale of material in the wind.
