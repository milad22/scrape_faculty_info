After obtaining a PhD, he held three-year postdoctoral research positions at Purdue University and The Ohio State University . Dr. Loh works on the theory of condensed matter systems, where the mutual interaction of large numbers of particles leads to interesting collective behavior. \u00a0He is particularly interested in the production and detection of novel\u00a0phases of strongly correlated fermions and bosons, in\u00a0mathematical models, materials, and ultracold atomic gases. \u00a0Magnetism, superconductivity, disorder, quantum criticality,\u00a0and Coulomb blockade effects are recurring themes in his research.
