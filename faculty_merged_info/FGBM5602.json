                "Richard Klemm Professor PSB 402 Richard.Klemm@ucf.edu 407-823-1543 Highlights The Klemm research group is currently interested in p -wave superconductivity, the Knight shift in metals and superconductors, a quantum particle in high-symmetry two-and three-dimensional boxes,\u00a0 the coherent terahertz emission from the high-temperature superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+\uf064 (BSCCO), and more generally the orbital symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors. We are also engaged in studies of a quantum particle in high-symmetry disk, square, equilateral triangular, and cubic boxes, in which a single particle is confined due to the infinite potential outside the box. For the similar high-symmetry thin BSCCO microstrip antennas, only the wave functions that are one-dimensional representations of the appropriate point group are fixed in orientation over several periods of the ac Josephson current source, so the only cavity modes that can be excited arise from these wave functions. See Fig. 1.\u00a0 Experimental results from a thermally-managed BSCCO disk microstrip antenna are also shown in Fig. 1, indicating that the transverse magnetic (1,1) mode due to a two-dimensional group representation is missing, and also that the linewidth at the 2.4 THz emission frequency is very narrow, placing a lower limit of 9.8 meV on the bulk superconducting gap \uf044 of BSCCO.
