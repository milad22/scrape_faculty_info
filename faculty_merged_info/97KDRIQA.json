                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark, CKM quark-mixing matrix, V ud & V us , V cb & V ub , fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles, cosmological \u2026"

At the loftiest level, it is part of the age old quest of mankind to understand where we come from and why we are here.\u00a0 Meenakshi Narain has been involved with the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) and the D\u00d8 experiment at Fermilab (Batavia, IL). She was instrumental in the discovery of the top quark in 1995, which is the heaviest fundamental particle and as heavy as an Osmium atom. Narain continues her quest at the LHC with the CMS experiment. In 2012, Narain\u2019s group had significant involvement in the discovery of the Higgs Boson. \u00a0Narain continues her quest at the LHC with the CMS experiment. In 2012, Narain\u2019s group had significant involvement in the discovery of the Higgs Boson. Narain was elected Chair of the USCMS Collaboration Board in June 2018 for a two-year term. In this capacity,\u00a0 she represents the\u00a0 US members collaborating on the CMS experiment in LHC. The US contingent includes\u00a0 ~1200 members (scientists, students, and engineers) from 48 universities and 2 national labs in the US, which constitutes about 27% of the international CMS collaboration.\u00a0 She is a member of he Management Board of the international\u00a0CMS Collaboration as the representative of the US collaboration. This board is the highest governing body of the CMS Collaboration.\u00a0 Narain served as the \u201cConvener of Upgrade Physics and Performance Studies Group (HL-LHC)\" for the international CMS experiment from February 2016-December 2018. In Jan 2013, Narain was appointed the coordinator of Fermilab's LHC Physics Center for CMS, where she has promoted collaboration with colleagues from South America, Europe, India, and Iran, in a peaceful quest for knowledge. Narain has been engaged in STEM outreach activities to encourage participation of young women in science. Prof. Narain serves as a member of the \"Diversity Committee\" of the CMS Experiment. She served as the founding chair of this committee from September 2017-August 2018. She is an informal mentor and faculty advisor of the Physics Department WiSE group. She is on the advisory comittee of the university GWiSE. Prof. Meenakshi Narain received her PhD in physics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She joined the Brown faculty in 2007 having previously taught at Boston University. Narain is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. She has been a Wilson Fellow at Fermilab and has received a Professional Opportunities for\u00a0Women in Research and Education grant, Major Research Infrastructure grants, and the CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation. She is also a\u00a0recipient of the Outstanding Junior Investigator Award from the US Department of Energy. Her current research is supported by the DOE. She is a co-author on about 400 peer-reviewed journals, and has given\u00a0numerous public lectures and invited conference presentations. Brown Affiliations Physics Research Areas CERN | CMS | Dzero | experimental particle physics | Fermilab | HEP | high energy physics | LHC | particle physics | physics Research Research Overview As the\u00a0 discovery of the Higgs Boson has also brought particle physics into a new era, Narain refocused her research to study this new particle . \u00a0She and her team are working on studying the properties of the Higgs Boson\u00a0and its implications.\u00a0She also is \u00a0interested in uncovering new signals \u00a0such as a neutral heavy gauge boson, or a heavy partner of the Top quark, anticipated by models \u00a0to stabilize the mass of the Higgs Boson. Research Statement Narain is co-leading the effort to establish the vision and studies for\u00a0physics and the upgrade of the CMS detector for the High\u00a0Luminosity upgrade of the LHC in 2023. In 2013, Narain led many of the studies which formed the basis of the snowmass 2013 community study report as input to the P5 committee defining the priorities of US particle physics projects.\u00a0 Narain is engaged in R&D towards the construction of the tracking detector, made from silicon sensors, which forms the innermost part of the CMS experiment. This detector provides a precise measurement of the momentum of the charged particles produced in the collision. Her lab is one of the sites selected for the\u00a0construction of silicon strip tracker for CMS operations at HL-LHC.\u00a0\u00a0Media coverage of her role at the LHC in finding the Higgs Boson can be obtained on request. Narain\u2019s research impacts society on many levels. Addressing questions at the microscopic scale and beyond has always required innovation. The CMS experiment is extremely demanding in terms of equipment design, and\u00a0 generates novel technical approaches which ultimately benefit society. On a more practical level, research in particle physics drives technology to the edge and many of its spinoffs are commonplace today \u2013 to name a few clich\u00e9s\u2026 such as accelerators for cancer therapy and the www protocol. The diverse technological and analytical training spanning engineering, mathematics, computing and electronics obtained in an international and collaborative environment is much sought after in many commercial sectors.\u00a0 The efforts of the LHC experiments in\u00a0 distributed computing\u00a0 link Grid computing with cloud computing, an invaluable tool for big data analysis. Narain has been involved in outreach to promote science education at all levels. She continues to\u00a0invest her time to mentor the educators and establish resources to establish opportunities for young scientists in rural India, specifically in UP, with the aim of promoting a world class culture of scientific research in colleges.
