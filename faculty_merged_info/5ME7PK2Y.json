                "We propose that a strongly interacting particle is a finite region of space to which fields are confined. The confinement is accomplished in a Lorentz-invariant way by endowing the finite region with a constant energy per unit volume, B. We call this finite region a\" bag.\" The contained fields may be either fermions or bosons and may have any spin; they may or may not be coupled to one another. Equations of motion and boundary conditions are obtained from a variational principle. The confining region has no dynamical freedom but constrains the fields inside: There are no excitations of the coordinates determining the confining region. The model possesses many desirable features of hadron dynamics:(i) a parton interpretation and presumably Bjorken scaling; the confined fields are free or weakly interacting except close to the boundary;(ii) infinitely rising Regge trajectories as a consequence of the bag's finite extent \u2026",
                "A relativistic quark model of the hadron based on the bag theory is presented. The bag equations for massless, Dirac fields with quark quantum numbers are solved in three space dimensions for the special case of a static spherical boundary. These solutions are quantized in an approximation which neglects zero-point fluctuations. The spectrum of lowlying baryon resonances is constructed. The only parameter of the model is fixed by the average mass of the N (938) and \u0394 (1236). The gyromagnetic ratio, axial-vector charge, and charge radius of the proton are computed and found to be 2.6, 1.09, and 1.0 fm, respectively. Refinements of the quantization procedure are discussed.",
                "We develop the classical and quantum mechanics of a massless relativistic string, the light string, which is characterized by an action proportional to the area of the world sheet swept out by the string in space time. We show that, classically, there are only D-2 dynamically independent components among the D functions x\u03bc(\u03c3, \u03c4) which represent the world sheet (D is the dimension of space time). Quantizing only these independent components, we find that the angular momentum operators suggested by the correspondence principle generate O(D-1,1) only when the first excited state is a photon, i.e., a spin-one massless state, and when D = 26. By allowing additional degrees of freedom in the quantum mechanics, we are able to quantize the string in a Lorentz covariant manner for any value of D and any mass for the first excited state. In this latter scheme the full Fock space contains negative norm states. However \u2026",

                "The Liouville theory is quantized with use of Fock-space methods, an infinite set of charges L n, n= 0,\u00b11,\u2026, is constructed which represents the conformal algebra in two dimensions, and consequences of this algebra are discussed. It is then argued, with use of variational methods in Fock space, that the spectrum of the Liouville Hamiltonian is continuous, and that there exist energy eigenstates obeying the constraints L n| E>= 0, n> 0.",
                "It is shown that the number of states coupling in the Veneziano model when the space time dimension, d, is 26 (d = 10 for the Neveu-Schwarz model) is reduced in such a way that the Pomeron is probably a pole. A simple consequence of this counting is the absence of ghosts for d \u2a7d 26 (d \u2a7d 10 for Neveu-Schwartz).",
                "It is shown that bags made of colored quarks and gluons have an asymptotically linear Regge trajectory whose structure is dominated by colored flux lines. The slope is calculated and found to be given by \u03b1\u2032= 0.88 Ge V\u2212 2. The relationship to the dual string model is discussed and speculations are made about the possible relevance of the picture for approximate duality.",
                "We investigate the possibility of associating a finite rest mass density with the relativistic string at the classical level. We choose a modification of the massless Lagrangian which reduces in the non-relativistic limit to the usual non-relativistic string. After studying some simple classical motions of this system, we quantize the massive string in a similar way to the massless case. The Regge trajectories are linear as in the massless case, but their intercepts are shifted downward from unity by an amount proportional to the square of the rest mass density parameter. Our naive quantization procedure is covariant only in 25 space-time dimensions. However, we are able to use the extra degree of freedom implicit in the mass density to modify the Lorentz generators so that covariance is maintained for any dimension less than 25. We envisage hadronic interactions to be introduced through the breaking and joining of strings \u2026",
                "We present an account of string field theory which aims to introduce the reader to the important concepts of the subjects as well as to aid access to the literature. Light cone string theory is briefly reviewed, but the emphasis is on the covariant approach exploiting world sheet BRST invariance to define string field derivations, integration, and products. Although we try to present the ideas in a general way, we draw on Witten's formulation of open string field theory for most of our examples. We include brief self-contained reviews of both the operator and Lagrangian versions of the BRST formalism employed in this article. There is a detailed account of perturbation theory for Witten's theory, including a few explicit sample calculations. Open problems faced by open superstring field theory and by closed string field theory are discussed. We sketch some of the ideas for attacking them but do not give a definitive resolution \u2026",
                "Conformal mapping techniques are employed to obtain the oscillator representation of the three open string vertex in Witten's formulation of string field theory. It is argued that the physical state couplings are identical to those of the dual resonance model, and this is confirmed for the low lying states with our explicit construction."
