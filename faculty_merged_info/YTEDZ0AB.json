Most recently, I have been fascinated by the neutrino sector of particle physics. Although the existence of these particles has been known for many decades, much is still unknown about them. What is the ordering of the neutrinos? Is there CP-violation in the lepton sector? Are neutrinos responsible for leptogenesis? Can neutrinos lead to a discovery of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics? The answers to these questions could have a profound impact on our fundamental understanding of the physical universe. Currently, I contribute to the MINOS, NOvA, and DUNE experimental collaborations. These experiments study neutrino oscillation phenomena and rely on two distantly separated detectors to measure the composition of the neutrino flavors along a beam line produced at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory In the MINOS collaboration, I am a leader of the analysis effort that is searching for exotic electron-neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam. If exotic electron-neutrino appearance is observed, then this would potentially indicate the presence of sterile neutrinos or nonstandard neutrino interactions with matter. Our current limits on nonstandard neutrino interactions can be found here . In the NOvA collaboration, I am a leader of the analysis effort that is measuring the disappearance of muon neutrinos. During the summer of 2016, we released exciting results from this analysis. A description of the results can be found here . The DUNE experiment is currently in development and is anticipated to take data in the coming decade. I am involved in the prototyping effort that seeks to record data in a particle beam at CERN.
