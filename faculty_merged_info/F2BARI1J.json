                "This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg 2 of imaging data, with most of the~ 2000 deg 2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120 long, 2 fdg 5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg 2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg 2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was \u2026",
                "We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P (k) from over 200 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other data. Our results are consistent with a \u201cvanilla\u201d flat adiabatic cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant without tilt (n s= 1), running tilt, tensor modes, or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 \u03c3 constraints on the Hubble parameter from h\u2248 0.74\u2212 0.07+ 0.18 to h\u2248 0.70\u2212 0.03+ 0.04, on the matter density from \u03a9 m\u2248 0.25\u00b10.10 to \u03a9 m\u2248 0.30\u00b10.04 (1 \u03c3) and on neutrino masses from< 11 to< 0.6 eV (95%). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis \u2026",
                "We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the \u2026",
                "This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through 2005 June and represents the completion of the SDSS\u2010I project (whose successor, SDSS\u2010II, will continue through mid\u20102008). It includes five\u2010band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg2 and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 deg2 of that imaging data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. In addition to \u201cstandard\u201d SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy \u2026",
                "We measure the large\u2010scale real\u2010space power spectrum   by using a sample of 205,443 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, covering 2417 effective square degrees with mean redshift  . We employ a matrix\u2010based method using pseudo\u2013Karhunen\u2010Lo\u00e8ve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum\u2010variance measurements in 22 k\u2010bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift\u2010space distortions, with narrow and well\u2010behaved window functions in the range  . We pay particular attention to modeling, quantifying, and correcting for potential systematic errors, nonlinear redshift distortions, and the artificial red\u2010tilt caused by luminosity\u2010dependent bias. Our results are robust to omitting angular and radial density fluctuations and are consistent between different parts of the sky. Our final result is a measurement of the real\u2010space matter power spectrum   up to an unknown overall \u2026",
                "We measure the large-scale real-space power spectrum P (k) using luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and use this measurement to sharpen constraints on cosmological parameters from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We employ a matrix-based power spectrum estimation method using Pseudo-Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements in 20 k-bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window functions in the range 0.01 h\/Mpc< k< 0.2 h\/Mpc. Results from the LRG and main galaxy samples are consistent, with the former providing higher signal-to-noise. Our results are robust to omitting angular and radial density fluctuations and are consistent between different parts of the sky. They provide a striking confirmation of the predicted large \u2026",
                "This paper describes the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including all survey\u2010quality data taken through 2004 June. The data release includes five\u2010band photometric data for 180 million objects selected over 6670 deg2 and 673,280 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 4783 deg2 of those imaging data using the standard SDSS target selection algorithms. These numbers represent a roughly 27% increment over those of the Third Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. The Fourth Data Release also includes an additional 131,840 spectra of objects selected using a variety of alternative algorithms, to address scientific issues ranging from the kinematics of stars in the Milky Way thick disk to populations of faint galaxies and quasars.",
                "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of 3324 deg 2 of five-band (ugriz) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars, and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 deg 2 of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach a depth of r\u2248 22.2 (95% completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread function magnitudes for point \u2026",
                "Using the formalism of spin-weighted functions we present an all-sky analysis of polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin\u00b12 spherical harmonics. These are the analogues of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin\u00b12 multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receive contributions from scalar modes and does not cross correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit expressions \u2026",
                "We combine the constraints from the recent Ly \u03b1 forest analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the SDSS galaxy bias analysis with previous constraints from SDSS galaxy clustering, the latest supernovae, and 1st year WMAP cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We find significant improvements on all of the cosmological parameters compared to previous constraints, which highlights the importance of combining Ly \u03b1 forest constraints with other probes. Combining WMAP and the Ly \u03b1 forest we find for the primordial slope n s= 0.98\u00b10.02. We see no evidence of running, d n\/d ln\ufeff k=\u2212 0.003\u00b10.010, a factor of 3 improvement over previous constraints. We also find no evidence of tensors, r< 0.36 (95% cl). Inflationary models predict the absence of running and many among them satisfy these constraints, particularly negative curvature models such as those based on spontaneous symmetry breaking \u2026"
