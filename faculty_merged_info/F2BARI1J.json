                "This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg 2 of imaging data, with most of the~ 2000 deg 2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120 long, 2 fdg 5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg 2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg 2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was \u2026",
                "We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P (k) from over 200 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other data. Our results are consistent with a \u201cvanilla\u201d flat adiabatic cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant without tilt (n s= 1), running tilt, tensor modes, or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 \u03c3 constraints on the Hubble parameter from h\u2248 0.74\u2212 0.07+ 0.18 to h\u2248 0.70\u2212 0.03+ 0.04, on the matter density from \u03a9 m\u2248 0.25\u00b10.10 to \u03a9 m\u2248 0.30\u00b10.04 (1 \u03c3) and on neutrino masses from< 11 to< 0.6 eV (95%). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis \u2026",
                "We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the \u2026",
                "This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through 2005 June and represents the completion of the SDSS\u2010I project (whose successor, SDSS\u2010II, will continue through mid\u20102008). It includes five\u2010band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg2 and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 deg2 of that imaging data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. In addition to \u201cstandard\u201d SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy \u2026",
                "We measure the large\u2010scale real\u2010space power spectrum   by using a sample of 205,443 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, covering 2417 effective square degrees with mean redshift  . We employ a matrix\u2010based method using pseudo\u2013Karhunen\u2010Lo\u00e8ve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum\u2010variance measurements in 22 k\u2010bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift\u2010space distortions, with narrow and well\u2010behaved window functions in the range  . We pay particular attention to modeling, quantifying, and correcting for potential systematic errors, nonlinear redshift distortions, and the artificial red\u2010tilt caused by luminosity\u2010dependent bias.

The data release includes five\u2010band photometric data for 180 million objects selected over 6670 deg2 and 673,280 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 4783 deg2 of those imaging data using the standard SDSS target selection algorithms. These numbers represent a roughly 27% increment over those of the Third Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. The Fourth Data Release also includes an additional 131,840 spectra of objects selected using a variety of alternative algorithms, to address scientific issues ranging from the kinematics of stars in the Milky Way thick disk to populations of faint galaxies and quasars.",
                "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of 3324 deg 2 of five-band (ugriz) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars, and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 deg 2 of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach a depth of r\u2248 22.2 (95% completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread function magnitudes for point \u2026",
                "Using the formalism of spin-weighted functions we present an all-sky analysis of polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin\u00b12 spherical harmonics. These are the analogues of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin\u00b12 multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receive contributions from scalar modes and does not cross correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit expressions \u2026",
                "We combine the constraints from the recent Ly \u03b1 forest analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the SDSS galaxy bias analysis with previous constraints from SDSS galaxy clustering, the latest supernovae, and 1st year WMAP cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We find significant improvements on all of the cosmological parameters compared to previous constraints, which highlights the importance of combining Ly \u03b1 forest constraints with other probes. Combining WMAP and the Ly \u03b1 forest we find for the primordial slope n s= 0.98\u00b10.02. We see no evidence of running, d n\/d ln\ufeff k=\u2212 0.003\u00b10.010, a factor of 3 improvement over previous constraints. We also find no evidence of tensors, r< 0.36 (95% cl). Inflationary models predict the absence of running and many among them satisfy these constraints, particularly negative curvature models such as those based on spontaneous symmetry breaking \u2026"

He received his B.S. in 1989 and M.S. in 1991 from Ljubljana University, Slovenia and his PhD in 1995 from MIT. He was a Smithsonian Fellow at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from 1995 to 1998. Subsequently he served as a faculty at Princeton University, ICTP Trieste and Zurich University. He is the recipient of the David and Lucile Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering (2000), the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship (2001), the Helen B. Warner award of American Astronomical Society (2001) and the NSF CAREER award (2002). I am a theoretical cosmologist by training but much of my recent work has been focused on how to extract fundamental properties of our universe from cosmological observations. The so called standard cosmological model of the universe has been very successful in explaining most of the cosmological observations to date. In this model the universe begins with a Big Bang followed by inflation during which the universe becomes nearly flat and the initial structures are seeded through quantum fluctuations. After its decay the universe is filled with radiation and matter, of which dark matter is itsmain component. Another component dubbed dark energy is needed to explain its acceleration in recent times and if it is in the form of cosmological constant it will dominate the expansion of the universe forever into the future. Despite the success of this model there is no shortage of theoretical alternatives, some of which differ dramatically from the standard model, such as the dark energy being dynamical in nature allowing for different scenarios of the past and future evolution of the universe, or the cyclic model of the universe which postulates the universe is going through cycles of expansion and contraction. Among the questions we can attempt to answer through observations are: what mechanism seeded the initial structures in the universe? What is the nature of dark energy? What is the future fate of the universe? What is the neutrino mass and number of neutrino families? What is the nature of dark matter? Current Projects Weak lensing : weak lensing efforts in our group are focused on measuring the correlations between galaxies and dark matter from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have developed an analysis pipeline to go from the observed galaxy shapes to the projected dark matter density around the galaxies and clusters. Some of the science projects that can be applied to this data are to measure the dark matter profiles of galaxies and clusters, to measure the relation between galaxy properties, such as luminosity, and their dark matter halos, such as their mass, to measure the large scale correlations between galaxies and dark matter etc. Ultimate goal of these studies is to learn about the growth of structure in the universe as a function of time, which is a powerful probe of many cosmological models, including the nature of dark energy. Galaxy clustering : we continue to work on galaxy clustering properties for several different data sets within SDSS, such as the Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), quasars, main galaxies etc., using both spectroscopic and photometric information. Auto-correlation analysis can tell us about the clustering of dark matter up to an overall constant called bias, but in connection with the weak lensing we can also determine the bias and thus measure the dark matter power spectrum. Clustering of highly biased tracers is also a powerful test of non-gaussianity in initial conditions, which ultimately can differentiate between Big Bang\/inflation scenario versus cyclic universe model. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies : recent work in this area was to use WMAP satellite measurements and cross-correlate them with SDSS and other surveys in search of a signal. These cross-correlations are now sufficiently significant to place powerful constraints on dark energy and its alternatives, such as the modifications of gravity. We have also measured first signatures of weak lensing in CMB. Lyman alpha forest : neutral hydrogen absorption in spectra of distant quasars is another powerful probe of cosmological models. It is particularly useful to measure the coldness of dark matter, but can also be used to search for evidence of dark energy at high redshifts and is currently one of the probes to place limits on the neutrino mass. Our analysis is focused on thousands of quasar spectra in SDSS, which provide a very high signal to noise measurements of the power spectrum over a broad range of redshifts and scales. Theory and cosmological simulations : in order to compare these probes to theoretical models one needs to bring theoretical predictions to the data. Sometimes this involves analytical calculations, sometimes numerical codes based on linear perturbation theory (such as CMBFAST, the code for CMB anisotropies we developed), very often however one must resort to numerical simulations of dark matter and, sometimes, dark matter with gas and stars. We use large supercomputers to push the envelope of thenumerical simulations, running some of the largest simulations ever with billions of particles.
