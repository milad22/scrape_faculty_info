                "Joseph Boudreau Professor 418 Allen Hall (412) 624\u20139022 boudreau@pitt.edu Joe Boudreau works on\u00a0the ATLAS experiment at CERN , the European Center for Particle Physics which is located in Geneva, Switzerland, where protons are collided at the world's highest energies. In the past he has worked on the CDF experiment at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider, and on the ALEPH experiment at the LEP electron-positron collider. \u00a0His main pursuit in each of these experiments has been precise measurements of the properties of elementary particles, including the Z boson, b-flavoured hadrons, and most recently the top quark, which is the world's most massive particle. \u00a0He also specializes in computing and software and is an expert in visualization of collision events.
