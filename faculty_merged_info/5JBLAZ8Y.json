                "Electrons moving through a spatially periodic lattice potential develop a quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum 1. Known as Hofstadter\u2019s butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and is one of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with periodicities of less than one nanometre \u2026",
                "We have observed new combination modes in the range from 1650 to 2300 cm\u22121 in single-(SLG), bi-, few-layer and incommensurate bilayer graphene (IBLG) on silicon dioxide substrates. A peak at \u223c1860 cm\u22121 (iTALO\u2212) is observed due to a combination of the in-plane transverse acoustic (iTA) and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The intensity of this peak decreases with increasing number of layers and this peak is absent for bulk graphite. The overtone of the out-of-plane transverse optical (oTO) phonon at \u223c1750 cm\u22121, also called the M band, is suppressed for both SLG and IBLG. In addition, two previously unidentified modes at \u223c2200 and \u223c1880 cm\u22121 are observed in SLG. The 2220 cm\u22121 (1880 cm\u22121) mode is tentatively assigned to the combination mode of in-plane transverse optical (iTO) and TA phonons (oTO+LO phonons) around the K point in the graphene Brillouin zone. Finally, the peak \u2026",
                "Noncovalent functionalization of graphene using peptides is a promising method for producing novel sensors with high sensitivity and selectivity. Here we perform atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate peptide-binding behavior to graphene and graphite. We studied a dodecamer peptide identified with phage display to possess affinity for graphite. Optical spectroscopy reveals that the peptide forms secondary structures both in powder form and in an aqueous medium. The dominant structure in the powder form is \u03b1-helix, which undergoes a transition to a distorted helical structure in aqueous solution. The peptide forms a complex reticular structure upon adsorption on graphene and graphite, having a helical conformation different from \u03b1-helix due to its interaction with the surface. Our observation is consistent with our molecular \u2026",
                "In two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), new electronic phenomena such as tunable bandgaps 1, 2, 3 and strongly bound excitons and trions emerge from strong many-body effects 4, 5, 6, beyond the spin and valley degrees of freedom induced by spin\u2013orbit coupling and by lattice symmetry 7. Combining single-layer TMDs with other 2D materials in van der Waals heterostructures offers an intriguing means of controlling the electronic properties through these many-body effects, by means of engineered interlayer interactions 8, 9, 10. Here, we use micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) and in situ surface doping to manipulate the electronic structure of single-layer WS 2 on hexagonal boron nitride (WS 2\/h-BN). Upon electron doping, we observe an unexpected giant renormalization of the spin\u2013orbit splitting of the single-layer WS 2 \u2026",
                "Two-dimensional materials provide a unique platform to explore the full potential of magnetic proximity-driven phenomena, which can be further used for applications in next-generation spintronic devices. Of particular interest is to understand and control spin currents in graphene by the magnetic exchange field of a nearby ferromagnetic material in graphene\u2013ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI) heterostructures. Here, we present the experimental study showing the strong modulation of spin currents in graphene layers by controlling the direction of the exchange field due to FMI magnetization. Owing to clean interfaces, a strong magnetic exchange coupling leads to the experimental observation of complete spin modulation at low externally applied magnetic fields in short graphene channels. Additionally, we discover that the graphene spin current can be fully dephased by randomly fluctuating exchange fields. This is \u2026",
                "We have measured the impact of atomic hydrogen adsorption on the electronic transport properties of graphene sheets as a function of hydrogen coverage and initial, pre-hydrogenation field-effect mobility. Our results are compatible with hydrogen adsorbates inducing intervalley mixing by exerting a short-range scattering potential. The saturation coverages for different devices are found to be proportional to their initial mobility, indicating that the number of native scatterers is proportional to the saturation coverage of hydrogen. By extrapolating this proportionality, we show that the field-effect mobility can reach 1.5\u00d7 10 4 cm 2\/V s in the absence of the hydrogen-adsorbing sites. This affinity to hydrogen is the signature of the most dominant type of native scatterers in graphene-based field-effect transistors on SiO 2.",
                "We report on multiphonon Raman scattering in graphene samples. Higher-order combination modes involving three and four phonons are observed in single-layer, bilayer, and few-layer graphene samples prepared by mechanical exfoliation. The intensity of the higher-order phonon modes (relative to the G peak) is highest in single-layer graphene and decreases with increasing layers. In addition, all higher-order modes are observed to upshift in frequency almost linearly with increasing graphene layers, betraying the underlying interlayer van der Waals interactions.",
                "We present an experimental study of spin transport in single layer graphene using atomic sheets of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a tunnel barrier for spin injection. While h-BN is expected to be favorable for spin injection, previous experimental studies have been unable to achieve spin relaxation times in the nanosecond regime, suggesting potential problems originating from the contacts. Here, we investigate spin relaxation in graphene spin valves with h-BN barriers and observe room temperature spin lifetimes in excess of a nanosecond, which provides experimental confirmation that h-BN is indeed a good barrier material for spin injection into graphene. By carrying out measurements with different thicknesses of h-BN, we show that few layer h-BN is a better choice than monolayer for achieving high non-local spin signals and longer spin relaxation times in graphene.",
                "Graphene has remarkable opportunities for spintronics due to its high mobility and long spin diffusion length, especially when encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Here, we demonstrate gate-tunable spin transport in such encapsulated graphene-based spin valves with one-dimensional (1D) ferromagnetic edge contacts. An electrostatic backgate tunes the Fermi level of graphene to probe different energy levels of the spin-polarized density of states (DOS) of the 1D ferromagnetic contact, which interact through a magnetic proximity effect (MPE) that induces ferromagnetism in graphene. In contrast to conventional spin valves, where switching between high-and low-resistance configuration requires magnetization reversal by an applied magnetic field or a high-density spin-polarized current, we provide an alternative path with the gate-controlled spin inversion in graphene.",
                "We report the synthesis and transfer of epitaxial germanane (GeH) onto arbitrary substrates by electrochemical delamination and investigate its optoelectronic properties. GeH films with thickness ranging from 1 to 600 nm (2\u20131000 layers) and areas up to~ 1 cm 2 have been reliably transferred and characterized by photoluminescence, x-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Wavelength dependent photoconductivity measurements on few-layer GeH exhibit an absorption edge and provide a sensitive characterization tool for ultrathin germanane materials. The transfer process also enables the possibility of integrating germanane into vertically stacked heterostructures."
