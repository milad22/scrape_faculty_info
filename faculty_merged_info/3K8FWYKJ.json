                "We present calculated optical harmonic spectra for atoms and ions in the high intensity regime to current short-pulse experiments. We find that ions can produce harmonics comparable in strength to those obtained from neutrals, and that the emission extends to much higher order. Simple scaling laws for the strength of the harmonic emission and the maximum observable harmonic are suggested. These results imply that the photoemission observed in recent experiments in helium and neon contains contributions from ions as well as neutrals.",
                "We present high sensitivity electron energy spectra for xenon in a strong 50 ps, 1.053 \u03bcm laser field. The above threshold ionization distribution is smoothly decreasing over the entire kinetic energy range (0\u201330 eV), with no abrupt changes in the slope. This is in direct contrast to the sharp cutoff observed in xenon optical harmonic generation spectra. Calculations using the single active electron approximation show excellent agreement with the observed electron distributions. These results directly address the unresolved relationship between the electron and photon emission from an atom in an intense field.",
                "The production of He+ and He 2+ by a 160 fs, 780 nm laser has been measured over an unprecedented 12 orders of magnitude in counting range. Enhanced double electron emission, called nonsequential (NS) ionization, was observed over an intensity range where the single ionization dynamics is evolving from multiphoton to pure tunneling. The NS yield is found to scale with the ac-tunneling rate for the neutral, even when tunneling is not the dominant ionization pathway. A rescattering mechanism fails to predict the observed NS threshold or magnitude."

                "Kenneth Schafer Ball Family Distinguished Professor Ph.D., 1989 - University of Arizona 222-B Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-0466-Office schafer@phys.lsu.edu Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics I am a theoretical AMO physicist who specializes in strong field physics. The name\n                  ``strong field physics'' refers to the interaction of intense, ultrafast laser pulses\n                  with atomic and molecular systems. Strong field physics takes place in the interesting\n                  regime where the electron-ion and electron-laser interactions are of competing strengths.\n                  This gives rise to a host of time-dependent and highly non- linear phenomenon such\n                  as above threshold ionization, high harmonic generation, sequential and non-sequential\n                  multiple ionization of atoms and molecules, and x-ray production from clusters, which\n                  are characterized both by rapid ionization and the coherent interaction of the ionizing\n                  electron with the parent atomic or molecular ion. My current research centers on the theory of intense laser-matter interactions with\n                  an emphasis on the generation and application of attosecond pulses. An attosecond\n                  is 1\/1000 of a femtosecond, and attosecond sources are the shortest light pulses ever\n                  made. Since attosecond pulses were first measured in 2001, the growth of \"attoscience\"\n                  has been exponential, spurred by the potential these pulses have for imaging and controlling\n                  electron motion. Our research group, consisting of myself and Mette Gaarde, has the\n                  unique capability to investigate all phases of the attosecond pulse generation process,\n                  from the microscopic single atom interaction to the macroscopic propagation and phase\n                  matching of the emitted radiation. The research is interdisciplinary, combining atomic\n                  and optical physics, and centered around high performance computing for non-perturbative\n                  solutions of both the time- dependent Schroedinger equation and the Maxwell wave equation.\n                  The research is highly relevant to experiment and we have active collaborations with\n                  several of the leading experimental groups pursuing attosecond science. We are involved\n                  in all phases of the experimental work, both as interpreters of results and as partners\n                  in designing new experiments.
