                "The D\u00d8 experiment enjoyed a very successful data-collection run at the Fermilab Tevatron collider between 1992 and 1996. Since then, the detector has been upgraded to take advantage of improvements to the Tevatron and to enhance its physics capabilities. We describe the new elements of the detector, including the silicon microstrip tracker, central fiber tracker, solenoidal magnet, preshower detectors, forward muon detector, and forward proton detector. The uranium\/liquid-argon calorimeters and central muon detector, remaining from Run I, are discussed briefly. We also present the associated electronics, triggering, and data acquisition systems, along with the design and implementation of software specific to D\u00d8.",
                "We report the observation of the X (3872) in the J\/\u03c8 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 channel, with J\/\u03c8 decaying to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212, in p p collisions at s= 1.96 T e V. Using approximately 230 p b\u2212 1 of data collected with the Run II D0 detector, we observe 522\u00b1100 X (3872) candidates. The mass difference between the X (3872) state and the J\/\u03c8 is measured to be 774.9\u00b13.1 (s t a t)\u00b13.0 (s y s t) M e V\/c 2. We have investigated the production and decay characteristics of the X (3872) and find them to be similar to those of the \u03c8 (2 S) state.",
                "We report results from the first search for \u03bd \u03bc\u2192 \u03bd e transitions by the NOvA experiment. In an exposure equivalent to 2.74\u00d7 10 20 protons on target in the upgraded NuMI beam at Fermilab, we observe 6 events in the Far Detector, compared to a background expectation of 0.99\u00b10.11 (syst) events based on the Near Detector measurement. A secondary analysis observes 11 events with a background of 1.07\u00b10.14 (syst). The 3.3 \u03c3 excess of events observed in the primary analysis disfavors 0.1 \u03c0< \u03b4 C P< 0.5 \u03c0 in the inverted mass hierarchy at the 90% CL",
                "Correlations in the azimuthal angle between the two largest transverse momentum jets have been measured using the D0 detector in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy s= 1.96 TeV. The analysis is based on an inclusive dijet event sample in the central rapidity region corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150 pb\u2212 1. Azimuthal correlations are stronger at larger transverse momenta. These are well described in perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, except at large azimuthal differences where contributions with low transverse momentum are significant.",
                "The cross section for the inclusive production of isolated photons has been measured in p p\u00af collisions at s= 1.96 TeV with the D\u00d8 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The photons span transverse momenta 23 to 300 GeV and have pseudorapidity| \u03b7|< 0.9. The cross section is compared with the results from two next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The theoretical predictions agree with the measurement within uncertainties.",
                "This paper reports the first measurement using the NOvA detectors of \u03bd \u03bc disappearance in a \u03bd \u03bc beam. The analysis uses a 14 kton-equivalent exposure of 2.74\u00d7 10 20 protons-on-target from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Assuming the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, we measure \u0394 m 32 2=(2.52\u2212 0.18+ 0.20)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 in the range 0.38\u20130.65, both at the 68% confidence level, with two statistically degenerate best-fit points at sin 2 \u03b8 23= 0.43 and 0.60. Results for the inverted mass hierarchy are also presented.",
                "The measurement of the inclusive differential cross sections for 1S production published in our recent Letter [1] requires a correction for an increase in the reported integrated luminosity. The instantaneous luminosity at D0 is measured by counting the number of inelastic collisions that produce charged particles within the acceptance of the luminosity monitor [2]. The determination of the luminosity has recently been improved through studies of the multiplicities observed in the luminosity monitor [3]. These studies indicated that the fraction of observable inelastic collisions was overestimated in our previous analysis [4]. The result of these improvements is to increase the assessment of the total integrated luminosity for this analysis by 16.5% to 185 11 pb 1 and to decrease the estimated uncertainty from 6.5% to 6.1%. The recalculated cross sections are shown in Table I.",
                "We present measurements of the inclusive production cross sections of the \u03a5 (1 S) bottomonium state in p p collisions at s= 1.96 TeV. Using the \u03a5 (1 S)\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay mode for a data sample of 159\u00b110 pb\u2212 1 collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, we determine the differential cross sections as a function of the \u03a5 (1 S) transverse momentum for three ranges of the \u03a5 (1 S) rapidity: 0<| y \u03a5|\u2264 0.6, 0.6<| y \u03a5|\u2264 1.2, and 1.2<| y \u03a5|\u2264 1.8.",
                "We present the first experimental discrimination between the 2 e\/3 and 4 e\/3 top quark electric charge scenarios, using top quark pairs (t t) produced in p p collisions at s= 1.96 TeV by the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We use 370 pb\u2212 1 of data collected by the D0 experiment and select events with at least one high transverse momentum electron or muon, high transverse energy imbalance, and four or more jets. We discriminate between b-and b-quark jets by using the charge and momenta of tracks within the jet cones. The data are consistent with the expected electric charge,| q|= 2 e\/3. We exclude, at the 92% CL, that the sample is solely due to the production of exotic quark pairs Q Q with| q|= 4 e\/3. We place an upper limit on the fraction of Q Q pairs \u03c1< 0.80 at the 90% CL",

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 226 pb\u2212 1 collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The final sample contains 2008 candidate events with an estimated background of 55%. From this we obtain \u03c3\u00b7 Br (Z\u2192 \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212)= 237\u00b115 (stat)\u00b118 (sys)\u00b115 (lum) pb, in agreement with the standard model prediction."
