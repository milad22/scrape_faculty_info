                "Satellite observations of enhanced energetic particle fluxes in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA) region have been supported by ground-based observations of enhanced ionization induced by particle precipitation in the ionosphere over this region. Past observations using a variety of instruments such as vertical sounding ionosondes, riometers and VLF receivers have provided evidences of the enhanced ionization due to energetic particle precipitation in the ionosphere over Brazil. The extra ionization at E-layer heights could produce enhanced ionospheric conductivity within and around the SAMA region. The energetic particle ionization source that is operative even under \u201cquiet\u201d conditions can undergo significant enhancements during magnetospheric storm disturbances, when the geographic region of enhanced ionospheric conductivity can extend to magnetic latitudes closer to the equator where \u2026",
                "Upward transport of wave energy and momentum due to gravity, tidal and planetary waves from below and extra-tropics controls the phenomenology of the equatorial atmosphere\u2013ionosphere system. An important aspect of this phenomenology is the development of small- and large-scale structures including thin layers in the mesosphere and E-region, and the formation of wide spectrum plasma structures of the equatorial F-region, widely known as equatorial spread F\/plasma bubble irregularities (that are known to have significant impact on space application systems based on trans-ionospheric radio waves propagation). It seems that the effects of tidal and gravity waves at mesospheric and thermospheric heights and their control of ionospheric densities, electric fields and currents are relatively better known than are the effects originating from vertical coupling due to planetary waves. Results from airglow, radar \u2026",
                "Analysis of the MLT region winds measured by a meteor radar and the evening F region vertical plasma drift (prereversal zonal electric field \u2010PRE) measured by digisondes over low latitude sites in Brazil, provide evidence of planetary wave (PW) scale oscillations of episodic nature simultaneously at mesospheric and F region heights. \u223c4\u2010day and 7\u2010day periods are found to dominate the event analyzed. The PW scale oscillations in the PRE produces strong modulation in the equatorial spread F (ESF) irregularity processes as diagnosed by the digisondes. Considerations on the PRE development mechanism involving the E layer integrated conductivity including the effect of metallic ions and tidal winds point to the source of the PRE oscillations to be PW modulation of E region tidal winds. The PW oscillations in PRE appear to be an important source of the day\u2010to\u2010day variability in the ESF.",
                "This paper presents a case study of the day\u2010to\u2010day variability in the midlatitude upper atmospheric ion temperature (~200\u2013400\u2009km) with a focus on variability resulting from meteorological forcing. The data are obtained by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (42.6\u00b0N, 288.5\u00b0E) on 18\u201331 January 2010, in coincidence with a major sudden stratospheric warming. We elucidate oscillations in ion temperature with both tidal periods (~8\u2009h and ~12\u2009h) and non\u2010tidal periods (>24\u2009h) by analyzing residuals between the observed temperatures and those expected from an empirical model. We present the spatial\u2010temporal development of periodicities in ion temperature and discuss to what degree these periodicities might be related to the sudden stratospheric warming event. The spectral location and temporal evolution of periodicities with ~9.9\u201312.9\u2009h and ~6.2\u20137.9\u2009h suggest that they are related to the semidiurnal \u2026",
                "We report on the first observation of a descending layer of atomic potassium (K) in the thermosphere. This observation was made with the K Doppler lidar at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (18.35\u00b0N; 66.75\u00b0W) on 12 March 2005. The layer was first observed before 08:00 UT (04:00 AST) centered near 145 km with the vertical extent up to \u223c155 km, and then it descended to near 126 km just over 2 h later at dawn. The descent rate of 2.56\u00b10.38 m\/s matches the vertical phase speed of the GSWM09-computed semidiurnal tide between 120 and 150 km. This also matches the descent rates of the thermospheric semidiurnal tides measured at Arecibo. Although the K density above 120 km remains less than 1 cm\u22123, its presence is unequivocal and has strong similarities to the neutral iron (Fe) layers in the thermosphere over 155 km recently discovered by lidar observations at McMurdo, Antarctica.

                "[1] We present a study of the climatology of thermospheric neutral wind (TNW) meridional and zonal components measured with the 630.0 nm nightglow Fabry\u2010Perot interferometer at the Arecibo Observatory from 1980 to 2010. We show and discuss the solar and geomagnetic dependencies as well as the long\u2010term trend of the TNW components and their variation over time and season. A main result of this study was the detection of a substantial seasonal and local time dependence of the response of the TNW to solar and geomagnetic activity. In addition, we found that there is a long\u2010term trend in the thermospheric neutral wind, which can be of a larger magnitude than the variation found in the seasonal, solar cycle, and geomagnetic activity influences. A major signature of this trend over the last 30 years was an increase in the meridional northward component up to 1.4 m s\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 before midnight local time \u2026",
                "Dynamical, electro-dynamical and electrical coupling processes originating from upward propagation of atmospheric waves, and magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction are responsible for the large degree of variabilities observed in the low latitude ionosphere. One of the most outstanding aspects of its phenomenology is related to the sunset electrodynamical processes responsible for the evening enhancements in zonal and vertical electric fields and the associated spread of F\/plasma bubble irregularity development. Recent observational results have provided evidence of significant contribution to their quiet time variability arising from thermospheric wind patterns, upward propagating planetary waves and possibly sporadic E layers. This paper provides an overview and some new results on planetary wave coupling with the equatorial F region, the E layer conductivity as key connecting mechanism, a possibly \u2026",
                "This work presents the results of a local empirical model that describes the behavior of the ionospheric F2 region peak. The model was developed using nearly 25 years of incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements made at the Arecibo Observatory (AO) between 1985 and 2009. The model describes the variability of the F2 peak frequency (foF2) and F2 peak height (hmF2) as a function of local time, season, and solar activity for quiet\u2010to\u2010moderate geomagnetic activity conditions (Kp < 4+). Our results show that the solar activity control of hmF2 and foF2 over Arecibo can be better described by a new proxy of the solar flux (F107P), which is presented here. The variation of hmF2 parameter with F107P is virtually linear, and only a small saturation of the foF2 parameter is observed at the highest levels of solar flux. The winter anomaly and asymmetries in the variation of the modeled parameters between equinoxes \u2026",
                "We present a geomagnetic quiet time (Dst > \u221250 nT) empirical model of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) for the northern equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crest over Calcutta, India. The model is based on the 1980\u20131990 TEC measurements from the geostationary Engineering Test Satellite-2 (ETS-2) at the Haringhata (University of Calcutta, India: 22.58\u00b0 N, 88.38\u00b0 E geographic; 12.09\u00b0 N, 160.46\u00b0 E geomagnetic) ionospheric field station using the technique of Faraday rotation of plane polarized VHF (136.11 MHz) signals. The ground station is situated virtually underneath the northern EIA crest. The monthly mean TEC increases linearly with F10.7 solar ionizing flux, with a significantly high correlation coefficient (r = 0.89\u20130.99) between the two. For the same solar flux level, the TEC values are found to be significantly different between the descending and ascending phases of the solar cycle. This \u2026"
