                "Free-standing graphite sheets with thickness less than 1nm, \u201ccarbon nanosheets,\u201d were synthesized on a variety of substrates by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition without any catalyst or special substrate treatment. The nanosheets consist of one to three graphene layers with a large smooth surface topography, standing roughly vertical to the substrate. Due to the atomic thickness and corrugated nature of nanosheets, low-energy vibrational modes are present in the Raman spectra. The low turn-on field of 4.7 V\/\u03bcm for electron field emission suggests that the carbon nanosheets could be used as a potential edge emitter."

He is also the Director of William & Mary's campus-wide Materials Processing Research Program and served as the Director of William & Mary ARC known as the Applied Research Center in Newport News, which operated 27 fully equipped laboratories in a 127,000 sq. ft. building adjacent to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The ARC, currently known as the Applied Reseach Center Core Labs, has been relocated to various locations on William & Mary's campus.  Prof. Manos' group has performed research in the fundamental science which underlies the formation and characterization of surfaces and interfaces with particular specialized properties. These properties include resistance to corrosion, reduced friction, pre-determined electrical properties, such as the production of high-quality, high-value-added superconducting or semiconducting thin films, specialized reflectors or absorbers for light, heat, or x-rays, and so forth. Research included plasma-surface interactions, surface cleaning and passivation , surface modification by particle and photon bombardment, and many other areas of fundamental and applied importance.  Before coming to Williamsburg, Dr. Manos was Principal Research Physicist as well as Group, Branch, and Division Head at the DOE Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory at Princeton Univ. He was VP of Technology for Materials Research Corporation and President of Princeton Scientific Consultants, Inc. He is a fellow of the American Vacuum Society, and founding Chair of the Applied Science Department at W&M.
