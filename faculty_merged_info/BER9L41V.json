                "Integral transform methods provide effective ways to solve a variety of problems arising in the engineering, optical and physical sciences. This concise, easy-to-follow reference text introduces the use of integral transforms, with a detailed discussion of the widely applicable Laplace and Fourier transforms. It is suitable as a self-study for practising engineers and applied mathematics, as well as a textbook for students in graduate-level courses in optics, engineering sciences, physics and mathematics. In most sections, applications relevant to engineers and applied scientists are used in place of formal proofs. Numerous examples, exercise sets, illustrations and tables enhance the book's usefulness as a teaching tool and reference."
