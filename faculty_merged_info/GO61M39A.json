Bell, University of Maryland Research Interests Galactic structure and history; Stellar atmospheres and radiative transfer; Stellar interiors, evolution, and proton-nucleosynthesis; Image processing; Numerical modeling; Scientific visualization Publications Available here through the ADS Courses Introductory Physics Introductory\u00a0Astronomy Classical Mechanics Optics * Astrophysics Stellar Atmospheres and Interiors Observational Techniques and Instrumentation * Galactic Astronomy * Planets and Exoplanets * Spectroscopy * Digital Electronics Analog Electronics Digital Signal Processing * (* Graduate course) Biography Dr. Briley is an award winning teacher and scholar with more than 50 authored\/co-authored peer-reviewed publications and over 1.3 million dollars in federal\/corporate grants as lead investigator. His primary research interests are focused on nuclear reactions in old stars and what they tell us about the history of our galaxy and how stars work. The courses Dr. Briley has taught range from introductory physics and astronomy to advanced astrophysics, stellar atmospheres and interiors, classical mechanics, optics, observational astronomy, galactic astronomy, digital electronics, analog electronics, digital signal processing, and others. His honors include a university-level teaching award, an endowed professorship, a research professorship, and the Director's Award for Collaborative Integration from the National Science Foundation. Dr. Briley came to Appalachian State in 2011 to serve as the department chair, which he did until 2018 when he stepped down to return to teaching and research. He received a BS in astronomy with Honors in the Liberal Arts from The Ohio State University in 1985, an MS in astronomy from the University of Maryland in 1989 and a PhD in astronomy from Maryland one year later. He then won the WJ McDonald Prize Fellowship at the University of Texas where he worked for four years before joining the faculty of University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh. There he spent seventeen years including seven years as a department head. He also served for four years as the Director of the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics at the National Science Foundation, where among other accomplishments, he doubled NSF funding for the search for planets around other stars. Dr. Briley's hobbies include mechanics (as in cars - when younger he was either going to be a mechanic or an astrophysicist), restoring\/remodeling homes, and nature photography (he has had public shows and his work can be found in various National Parks).
