                "Systems of superconducting islands placed on normal metal films offer tunable realizations of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity 1, 2; they can thus elucidate open questions regarding the nature of 2D superconductors and competing states. In particular, island systems have been predicted to exhibit zero-temperature metallic states 3, 4, 5. Although evidence exists for such metallic states in some 2D systems 6, 7, their character is not well understood: the conventional theory of metals cannot explain them 8, and their properties are difficult to tune 7, 9. Here, we characterize the superconducting transitions in mesoscopic island-array systems as a function of island thickness and spacing. We observe two transitions in the progression to superconductivity. Both transition temperatures exhibit unexpectedly strong depression for widely spaced islands, consistent with the system approaching zero-temperature (T= 0 \u2026",
                "We demonstrate that 3.5-MeV oxygen irradiation can markedly enhance the in-field critical current of commercial second generation superconducting tapes with an exposure time of just 1\u2009s per 0.8\u2009cm2. The speed demonstrated here is now at the level required for an industrial reel-to-reel post-processing. The irradiation is made on production line samples through the protective silver coating and does not require any modification of the growth process. From TEM imaging, we identify small clusters as the main source of increased vortex pinning.",
                "Superconductors are excellent testbeds for studying vortices, topological excitations that also appear in superfluids, liquid crystals and Bose\u2013Einstein condensates. Vortex motion can be disruptive; it can cause phase transitions 1, glitches in pulsars 2, and losses in superconducting microwave circuits 3, and it limits the current-carrying capacity of superconductors 4. Understanding vortex dynamics is fundamentally and technologically important, and the competition between thermal energy and energy barriers defined by material disorder is not completely understood. Specifically, early measurements of thermally activated vortex motion (creep) in iron-based superconductors unveiled fast rates (S) comparable to measurements of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 (refs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). This was puzzling because S is thought to somehow correlate with the Ginzburg number (Gi), and Gi is significantly lower in most iron-based \u2026",
                "We demonstrate a twofold increase in the in-field critical current of AMSC's standard 2G coil wire by irradiation with 18-MeV Au ions. The optimum pinning enhancement is achieved with a dose of 6 \u00d7 10 11  Au ions\/cm 2 . Although the 77 K, self-field critical current is reduced by about 35%, the in-field critical current (H\/\/c) shows a significant enhancement between 4 and 50 K in fields > 1 T. The process was used for the roll-to-roll irradiation of AMSC's standard 46-mm-wide production coated conductor strips, which were further processed into standard copper laminated coil wire. The long-length wires show the same enhancement as attained with short static irradiated samples. The roll-to-roll irradiation process can be incorporated in the standard 2G wire manufacturing, with no modifications to the current process. The enhanced performance of the wire will benefit rotating machine and magnet applications.",
                "YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 coated conductors (CCs) have achieved high critical current densities (J c) that can be further increased through the introduction of additional defects using particle irradiation. However, these gains are accompanied by increases in the flux creep rate, a manifestation of competition between the different types of defects. Here, we study this competition to better understand how to design pinning landscapes that simultaneously increase J c and reduce creep. CCs grown by metal organic deposition show non-monotonic changes in the temperature-dependent creep rate, S (T). Notably, in low fields, there is a conspicuous dip to low S as the temperature (T) increases from~ 20 to~ 65 K. Oxygen-, proton-, and Au-irradiation substantially increase S in this temperature range. Focusing on an oxygen-irradiated CC, we investigate the contribution of different types of irradiation-induced defects to the flux \u2026",
                "Recent interest in topological quantum computing has driven research into topological nanowires, one-dimensional quantum wires that support topological modes, including Majorana fermions. Most topological nanowire designs rely on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as In As or In Sb, used in combination with superconductors. It would be advantageous to fabricate topological nanowires with Si owing to its mature technology. However, the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in Si is weak. One approach that could circumvent this material deficiency is to rotate the electron spins with nanomagnets. Here we perform detailed simulations of realistic Si\/Si Ge systems with an artificial spin-orbit gap induced by a nanomagnet array. Most of our results are generalizable to other nanomagnet-based topological nanowire designs. By studying several concrete examples, we gain insight into the effects of nanomagnet \u2026",
                "The goal of this experiment is to fabricate undoped and doped ZBLAN microspheres in microgravity to investigate their quality factors (Q\u2019s) and lasing properties. To accomplish this, we propose to conduct an experiment aboard the KC-135 that assesses the viability of the substance known as ZBLAN as a new alternative fiber optic medium. The world\u2019s communications network was revolutionized by the deployment of fiber optics systems. However, conventional silica-based fiber optics suffer from serious limitations. They are only capable of carrying information within a small range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and even within that range they exhibit a relatively high signal attenuation. Seeking to improve upon silica-based materials, researchers have fabricated glasses in the heavy metal fluoride family. The most promising of these glasses is ZBLAN, named for its zirconium, barium, lanthanum, aluminum and \u2026",
                "The Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta (BKV) theory shows in excellent agreement with experiment that ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in clean metals are generally first order due to the coupling of the magnetization to electronic soft modes, in contrast to the classical analogue that is an archetypical second-order phase transition. For disordered metals the BKV theory predicts that the second-order nature of the QPT is restored because the electronic soft modes change their nature from ballistic to diffusive. Our low-temperature magnetization study identifies the ferromagnetic QPT in the disordered metal UCo 1\u2212 x Fe x Ge as the first clear example that exhibits the associated critical exponents predicted by the BKV theory.",
                "Fascination with glassy states has persisted since Fisher introduced the vortex-glass as a new thermodynamic phase that is a true superconductor that lacks conventional long-range order. Though Fisher\u2019s original model considered point disorder, it was later predicted that columnar defects (CDs) could also induce glassiness\u2014specifically, a Bose-glass phase. In YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x (YBCO), glassy states can cause distinct behavior in the temperature (T) dependent rate of thermally activated vortex motion (S). The vortex-glass state produces a plateau in S (T) whereas a Bose-glass can transition into a state hosting vortex excitations called double-kinks that can expand, creating a large peak in S (T). Although glass phases have been well-studied in YBCO, few studies exist of other materials containing CDs that could contribute to distinguishing universal behavior. Here, we report on the effectiveness of CDs tilted \u2026",
                "We present measurements of the superconducting transition temperature, T c, for arrays of mesoscopic Nb islands patterned on Au films, for large island spacings d. We show that T c~ 1\/d 2, and explain this dependence in terms of the quasiclassical prediction that the Thouless energy, rather than the superconducting gap, governs the inter-island coupling at large spacings. We also find that the temperature dependence of the critical current, I c (T), in our arrays is similar to that of single SNS junctions. However, our results deviate from the quasiclassical theory in that T c is sensitive to island height, because the islands are mesoscopic."
