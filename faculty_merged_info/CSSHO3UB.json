                "The T2K experiment observes indications of \u03bd \u03bc\u2192 \u03bd e appearance in data accumulated with 1.43\u00d7 10 20 protons on target. Six events pass all selection criteria at the far detector. In a three-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario with| \u0394 m 23 2|= 2.4\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2, sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 23= 1 and sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0, the expected number of such events is 1.5\u00b10.3 (syst). Under this hypothesis, the probability to observe six or more candidate events is 7\u00d7 10\u2212 3, equivalent to 2.5 \u03c3 significance. At 90% CL, the data are consistent with 0.03 (0.04)< sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13< 0.28 (0.34) for \u03b4 C P= 0 and a normal (inverted) hierarchy.",
                "We present a new measurement of the inclusive and differential production cross sections of J\/\u03c8 mesons and b hadrons in proton-antiproton collisions at s= 1960 G e V. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 39.7 p b\u2212 1 collected by the CDF run II detector. We find the integrated cross section for inclusive J\/\u03c8 production for all transverse momenta from 0 to 20 G e V\/c in the rapidity range| y|< 0.6 to be 4.08\u00b10.02 (s t a t)\u2212 0.33+ 0.36 (s y s t) \u03bc b. We separate the fraction of J\/\u03c8 events from the decay of the long-lived b hadrons using the lifetime distribution in all events with p T (J\/\u03c8)> 1.25 G e V\/c. We find the total cross section for b hadrons, including both hadrons and antihadrons, decaying to J\/\u03c8 with transverse momenta greater than 1.25 G e V\/c in the rapidity range| y (J\/\u03c8)|< 0.6 is 0.330\u00b10.005 (s t a t)\u2212 0.033+ 0.036 (s y s t) \u03bc b.

We observe 730\u00b190 decays. The mass is measured to be 3871.3\u00b10.7 (s t a t)\u00b10.4 (s y s t) M e V\/c 2, with an observed width consistent with the detector resolution. This is in agreement with the recent observation by the Belle Collaboration of the X (3872) meson.",
                "The NuTeV Collaboration has extracted the electroweak parameter sin 2 \u03b8 W from the measurement of the ratios of neutral current to charged current \u03bd and \u03bd cross sections. Our value, sin 2 \u03b8 W (on\u2212 shell)= 0.2277\u00b10.0013 (stat)\u00b10.0009 (syst), is 3 standard deviations above the standard model prediction. We also present a model independent analysis of the same data in terms of neutral-current quark couplings.",
                "The T2K experiment is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Its main goal is to measure the last unknown lepton sector mixing angle \u03b8 13 by observing \u03bd e appearance in a \u03bd \u03bc beam. It also aims to make a precision measurement of the known oscillation parameters, \u0394 m 23 2 and sin 2 2 \u03b8 23, via \u03bd \u03bc disappearance studies. Other goals of the experiment include various neutrino cross-section measurements and sterile neutrino searches. The experiment uses an intense proton beam generated by the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, Japan, and is composed of a neutrino beamline, a near detector complex (ND280), and a far detector (Super-Kamiokande) located 295 km away from J-PARC. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the instrumentation aspect of the T2K experiment and a summary of the vital information for each subsystem.",
                "We report the observation of B s 0\u2212 Bs 0 oscillations from a time-dependent measurement of the B s 0\u2212 Bs 0 oscillation frequency \u0394 m s. Using a data sample of 1 fb\u2212 1 of p p collisions at s= 1.96 TeV collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, we find signals of 5600 fully reconstructed hadronic B s decays, 3100 partially reconstructed hadronic B s decays, and 61 500 partially reconstructed semileptonic B s decays. We measure the probability as a function of proper decay time that the B s decays with the same, or opposite, flavor as the flavor at production, and we find a signal for B s 0\u2212 Bs 0 oscillations. The probability that random fluctuations could produce a comparable signal is 8\u00d7 10\u2212 8, which exceeds 5 \u03c3 significance. We measure \u0394 m s= 17.77\u00b10.10 (stat)\u00b10.07 (syst) ps\u2212 1 and extract| V td\/V ts|= 0.2060\u00b10.0007 (\u0394 m s)\u2212 0.0060+ 0.0081 (\u0394 m d+ theor)."

He did his graduate work in physics at the University of Chicago and received his MS in 1991 and his PhD in 1994. He held a Lederman Fellowship at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory from 1994 to 1998 and joined the University as an Assistant Professor of Physics in 1998. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2002 and to Professor in 2005. Professor McFarland was named an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow in 1998, a Department of Energy Outstanding Junior Investigator in 1999, a Cottrell Scholar in 2001 and received a National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2002. McFarland, who is also co-spokesperson of the MINERvA Neutrino Experiment at Fermilab, was elected fellow of the American Physical Society in 2005. He and his collaborators on the T2K neutrino experiment are recipients of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2015 Research Overview Professor McFarland's interests are in the field of experimental high-energy physics . His primary research interest is the study of neutrino properties and their weak interactions. The ultimate goal of these high intensity accelerator-based neutrino experiments is determination of the neutrino masses and the mixing between neutrino flavors and these masses through neutrino flavor oscillation measurements. Violations of matter-antimatter symmetry may be possible in neutrino mixings, and they may offer an explanation for the origin of the dominance of matter over antimatter in today's Universe. Professor McFarland currently works on the T2K experiment at J-PARC in Japan, and the ICARUS and DUNE experiments at Fermilab . He served from 2005 to 2018 as the co-spokesperson of the MINERvA neutrino experiment. He collaborates with Profs. Manly, Marshall, and Bodek to form the Rochester neutrino group . In the past, he worked on electroweak and top quark physics at the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider and studied the neutrino neutral current interactions at high precision in the NuTeV high energy neutrino experiment at Fermilab.
