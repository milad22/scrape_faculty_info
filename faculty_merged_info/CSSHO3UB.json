Six events pass all selection criteria at the far detector. In a three-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario with| \u0394 m 23 2|= 2.4\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2, sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 23= 1 and sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0, the expected number of such events is 1.5\u00b10.3 (syst). Under this hypothesis, the probability to observe six or more candidate events is 7\u00d7 10\u2212 3, equivalent to 2.5 \u03c3 significance. At 90% CL, the data are consistent with 0.03 (0.04)< sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13< 0.28 (0.34) for \u03b4 C P= 0 and a normal (inverted) hierarchy.",
                "We present a new measurement of the inclusive and differential production cross sections of J\/\u03c8 mesons and b hadrons in proton-antiproton collisions at s= 1960 G e V. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 39.7 p b\u2212 1 collected by the CDF run II detector. We find the integrated cross section for inclusive J\/\u03c8 production for all transverse momenta from 0 to 20 G e V\/c in the rapidity range| y|< 0.6 to be 4.08\u00b10.02 (s t a t)\u2212 0.33+ 0.36 (s y s t) \u03bc b. We separate the fraction of J\/\u03c8 events from the decay of the long-lived b hadrons using the lifetime distribution in all events with p T (J\/\u03c8)> 1.25 G e V\/c. We find the total cross section for b hadrons, including both hadrons and antihadrons, decaying to J\/\u03c8 with transverse momenta greater than 1.25 G e V\/c in the rapidity range| y (J\/\u03c8)|< 0.6 is 0.330\u00b10.005 (s t a t)\u2212 0.033+ 0.036 (s y s t) \u03bc b.

We observe 730\u00b190 decays. The mass is measured to be 3871.3\u00b10.7 (s t a t)\u00b10.4 (s y s t) M e V\/c 2, with an observed width consistent with the detector resolution.

Our value, sin 2 \u03b8 W (on\u2212 shell)= 0.2277\u00b10.0013 (stat)\u00b10.0009 (syst), is 3 standard deviations above the standard model prediction.

                "The T2K experiment is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Its main goal is to measure the last unknown lepton sector mixing angle \u03b8 13 by observing \u03bd e appearance in a \u03bd \u03bc beam. It also aims to make a precision measurement of the known oscillation parameters, \u0394 m 23 2 and sin 2 2 \u03b8 23, via \u03bd \u03bc disappearance studies. Other goals of the experiment include various neutrino cross-section measurements and sterile neutrino searches. The experiment uses an intense proton beam generated by the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, Japan, and is composed of a neutrino beamline, a near detector complex (ND280), and a far detector (Super-Kamiokande) located 295 km away from J-PARC. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the instrumentation aspect of the T2K experiment and a summary of the vital information for each subsystem.",

Using a data sample of 1 fb\u2212 1 of p p collisions at s= 1.96 TeV collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, we find signals of 5600 fully reconstructed hadronic B s decays, 3100 partially reconstructed hadronic B s decays, and 61 500 partially reconstructed semileptonic B s decays. We measure the probability as a function of proper decay time that the B s decays with the same, or opposite, flavor as the flavor at production, and we find a signal for B s 0\u2212 Bs 0 oscillations. The probability that random fluctuations could produce a comparable signal is 8\u00d7 10\u2212 8, which exceeds 5 \u03c3 significance. We measure \u0394 m s= 17.77\u00b10.10 (stat)\u00b10.07 (syst) ps\u2212 1 and extract| V td\/V ts|= 0.2060\u00b10.0007 (\u0394 m s)\u2212 0.0060+ 0.0081 (\u0394 m d+ theor)."
