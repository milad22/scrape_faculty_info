                "Precision agriculture (PA) is the application of geospatial techniques and sensors (e.g., geographic information systems, remote sensing, GPS) to identify variations in the field and to deal with them using alternative strategies. In particular, high-resolution satellite imagery is now more commonly used to study these variations for crop and soil conditions. However, the availability and the often prohibitive costs of such imagery would suggest an alternative product for this particular application in PA. Specifically, images taken by low altitude remote sensing platforms, or small unmanned aerial systems (UAS), are shown to be a potential alternative given their low cost of operation in environmental monitoring, high spatial and temporal resolution, and their high flexibility in image acquisition programming. Not surprisingly, there have been several recent studies in the application of UAS imagery for PA. The results \u2026",
                "There is growing research interest in the ethnobiology, socio-economics and management of mangrove forests. Coastal residents who use mangroves and their resources may have considerable botanical and ecological knowledgeable about these forests. A wide variety of forest products are harvested in mangroves, especially wood for fuel and construction, tannins and medicines. Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm \u2026",
                "Using both IKONOS and in situ LAI-2000 sensor data, a map of estimated LAI, based on NDVI, was created for the Agua Brava Lagoon, Mexican Pacific. The LAI values were then aggregated according to four classes; red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), healthy white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), poor condition white mangrove and dead mangrove. Of the live mangrove, calculated at approximately 85% of the forest, mean LAI values of 2.49, 1.74 and 0.85 were determined for the red, healthy white and poor condition white mangrove, respectively. Excluding the dead areas, an overall estimated mangrove LAI value of 1.81 was ascertained for the 71 km2 of mapped mangrove forest. Although the results do suggest the technique as a very rapid and effective method for monitoring the condition of mangroves at the species level, potential limitations are also discussed.",
                "This study records and documents the most severe and notable instance ever reported of sudden and widespread dieback of mangrove vegetation. Between late 2015 and early 2016, extensive areas of mangrove tidal wetland vegetation died back along 1000km of the shoreline of Australia\u2019s remote Gulf of Carpentaria. The cause is not fully explained, but the timing was coincident with an extreme weather event; notably one of high temperatures and low precipitation lacking storm winds. The dieback was severe and widespread, affecting more than 7400ha or 6% of mangrove vegetation in the affected area from Roper River estuary in the Northern Territory, east to Karumba in Queensland. At the time, there was an unusually lengthy period of severe drought conditions, unprecedented high temperatures and a temporary drop in sea level. Although consequential moisture stress appears to have contributed to the \u2026",
                "To evaluate the accounts of local fishermen, Landsat TM images (1986, 1993, 1999) were examined to assess potential losses in the mangrove forests of the Teacap\u00e1n\u2013Agua Brava lagoon system, Mexico. A binary change mask derived from image differencing of a band 4\/3 ratio was employed to calculate any changes within this forested wetland. The results indicate that by 1986 approximately 18% (or 86 km2) of the mangrove area under study was either dead or in poor condition. The majority of this damage had occurred in the eastern section of the Agua Brava basin, which coincides, with the reports of the elderly fishermen. Examination of aerial photographs from 1970 revealed no adverse impacts in this area and would suggest, as postulated by the fishermen and other scientists, that modifications in environmental conditions following the opening of a canal, Cuautl\u00e1 canal, in 1972 may have \u2026",
                "The aim of this paper is to assess the accuracy of an object-oriented classification of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to map and monitor crops using 19 RADARSAT-2 fine beam polarimetric (FQ) images of an agricultural area in North-eastern Ontario, Canada. Polarimetric images and field data were acquired during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. The classification and field data collection focused on the main crop types grown in the region, which include: wheat, oat, soybean, canola and forage. The polarimetric parameters were extracted with PolSAR analysis using both the Cloude\u2013Pottier and Freeman\u2013Durden decompositions. The object-oriented classification, with a single date of PolSAR data, was able to classify all five crop types with an accuracy of 95% and Kappa of 0.93; a 6% improvement in comparison with linear-polarization only classification. However, the time of \u2026",
                "Leaf Area Index (LAI) values from 124 mangrove plots were acquired within a degraded mangrove forest of the Agua Brava Lagoon System of Nayarit (Mexico) using a hand held LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. For each plot, two values of LAI were calculated to represent approximate half radii (180\u00b0) ground coverage of 8 m and 15 m. The location of each plot was recorded at sub-meter accuracy using an Ashtech SCA-12 GPS. Using a geometrically corrected IKONOS satellite image, the mean values for both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the simple ratio (SR) vegetation indices were also calculated for each plot. Regression analyses of the in situ LAI with both vegetation indices revealed significant positive relationships (LAI versus NDVI at 8 m (R2 = 0.71); LAI versus NDVI at 15 m (R2 = 0.70); LAI versus SR at 8 m (R2 = 0.73); LAI versus SR at 15 m (R2 = 0.72)) at the 8 m and 15 m plot \u2026",
                "To evaluate the local use of mangrove forests, forty interviews were conducted with elderly fishermen from six villages in the Teacapan-Agua Brava lagoon\u2013estuarine system of the State of Nayarit. Results indicate that the type of species is important to both the identification and local use of the mangrove forest. Overall, Laguncularia racemosa was identified as the species most frequently used in this region of Mexico, being employed quite regularly in the construction of tobacco galleries, stakes, poles, tapos (fish traps), fences and walls. By comparing the fishermen's perceived potential use of Rhizophora mangle to its perceived actual use, it was found that this species had been employed as an important source for medicine and tannins. However, Rhizophora mangle is presently employed, and only periodically, for ceiling support in rural homes. Several key problems encountered in the evaluation of mangrove \u2026",
                "Given the alarming global rates of mangrove forest loss it is important that resource managers have access to updated information regarding both the extent and condition of their mangrove forests. Mexican mangroves in particular have been identified as experiencing an exceptional high annual rate of loss. However, conflicting studies, using remote sensing techniques, of the current state of many of these forests may be hindering all efforts to conserve and manage what remains. Focusing on one such system, the Teacap\u00e1n\u2013Agua Brava\u2013Las Haciendas estuarine\u2013mangrove complex of the Mexican Pacific, an attempt was made to develop a rapid method of mapping the current condition of the mangroves based on estimated LAI. Specifically, using an AccuPAR LP-80 Ceptometer, 300 indirect in situ LAI measurements were taken at various sites within the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated \u2026"
