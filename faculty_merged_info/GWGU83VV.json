                "Kenneth J Voss SENIOR ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR RESEARCH AND GRADUATE EDUCATION kvoss@miami.edu (305) 284-4036 My research involves experimental ocean and atmospheric optics. This involves building novel instrumentation to measure the light field in the ocean and atmosphere. We then use this instrumentation on ships, during oceanographic cruises and at different locations in Miami, Bermuda and throughout the world. The applications of this research extend from understanding imaging and light transmission processes in the ocean to understanding the optical affects of aerosols (small particles) in the atmosphere, and their impact on energy transmission in the atmosphere. 1984 Ph.D. Physics Texas A&M University 1979 B.S.
