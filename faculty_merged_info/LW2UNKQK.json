                "A measurement of the Z\/\u03b3\u204e transverse momentum (p T Z) distribution in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 TeV is presented using Z\/\u03b3\u204e\u2192 e+ e\u2212 and Z\/\u03b3\u204e\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays collected with the ATLAS detector in data sets with integrated luminosities of 35 pb\u2212 1 and 40 pb\u2212 1, respectively. The normalized differential cross sections are measured separately for electron and muon decay channels as well as for their combination up to p T Z of 350 GeV for invariant dilepton masses 66 GeV< m \u2113 \u2113< 116 GeV. The measurement is compared to predictions of perturbative QCD and various event generators. The prediction of resummed QCD combined with fixed order perturbative QCD is found to be in good agreement with the data.",
                "We calculate analytically properties of holographic superconductors in the probe limit. We analyze the range 1\/2< \u0394< 3, where \u0394 is the dimension of the operator that condenses. We obtain the critical temperature in terms of a solution to a certain eigenvalue problem. Near the critical temperature, we apply perturbation theory to determine the temperature dependence of the condensate. In the low temperature limit we show that the condensate diverges as T\u2212 \u0394\/3 for \u0394< 3\/2 whereas it asymptotes to a constant value for which we provide analytic estimates for \u0394> 3\/2. We also obtain the frequency dependence of the conductivity by solving analytically the wave equation of electromagnetic perturbations. We show that the real part of the DC conductivity behaves as e\u2212 \u0394g\/T and estimate the gap \u0394 g analytically. Our results are in good agreement with numerical results.",
                "We study the ratio of the entropy to the total energy in conformal field theories at finite temperature. For the free field realizations of N= 4 super Yang\u2013Mills theory in D= 4 and the (2, 0) tensor multiplet in D= 6, the ratio is bounded from above. The corresponding bounds are less stringent than the recently proposed Verlinde bound. We show that entropy bounds arise generically in CFTs in connection to monotonicity properties with respect to temperature changes of a generalized C-function. For strongly coupled CFTs with AdS duals, we show that the ratio obeys the Verlinde bound even in the presence of rotation. For such CFTs, we point out an intriguing resemblance in their thermodynamic formulas with the corresponding ones of two-dimensional CFTs. We show that simple scaling forms for the free energy and entropy of CFTs with AdS duals reproduce the thermodynamical properties of (D+ 1)-dimensional AdS \u2026",
                "During inflation, spacetime is approximately described by de Sitter space which is conformally invariant with the symmetry group SO (1, 4). This symmetry can significantly constrain the quantum perturbations which arise in the inflationary epoch. We consider a general situation of single field inflation and show that the three point function involving two scalar modes and one tensor mode is uniquely determined, up to small corrections, by the conformal symmetries. Special conformal transformations play an important role in our analysis. Our result applies only to models where the inflaton sector also approximately preserves the full conformal group and shows that this three point function is a good way to test if special conformal invariance was preserved during inflation.",
                "We consider a gravitating system of vanishing cosmological constant consisting of an electromagnetic field and a scalar field coupled to the Einstein tensor. A Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole undergoes a second-order phase transition to a hairy black hole of generally anisotropic hair at a certain critical temperature which we compute. The no-hair theorem is evaded due to the coupling between the scalar field and the Einstein tensor. Within a first-order perturbative approach, we calculate explicitly the properties of a hairy black hole configuration near the critical temperature and show that it is energetically favourable over the corresponding Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole.",
                "A model of an exact gravity dual of a gapless superconductor is presented in which the condensate is provided by a charged scalar field coupled to a bulk black hole of hyperbolic horizon in asymptotically AdS spacetime. A critical temperature exists at which the mass of the black hole vanishes and a scaling symmetry emerges. Below the critical point, the black hole acquires its hair through a phase transition while an electromagnetic perturbation of the background Maxwell field determines the conductivity of the boundary theory.",
                "Machine learning is a fascinating and exciting field within computer science. Recently, this excitement has been transferred to the quantum information realm. Currently, all proposals for the quantum version of machine learning utilize the finite-dimensional substrate of discrete variables. Here we generalize quantum machine learning to the more complex, but still remarkably practical, infinite-dimensional systems. We present the critical subroutines of quantum machine learning algorithms for an all-photonic continuous-variable quantum computer that can lead to exponential speedups in situations where classical algorithms scale polynomially. Finally, we also map out an experimental implementation which can be used as a blueprint for future photonic demonstrations.",
                "We study the perturbative behaviour of topological black holes with scalar hair. We calculate both analytically and numerically the quasi-normal modes of the electromagnetic perturbations. In the case of small black holes we find evidence of a second-order phase transition of a topological black hole to a hairy configuration.",
                "We study branes moving in an AdS Schwarzschild black hole background. When the brane tension exceeds a critical value, the induced metric on the brane is of FRW type and asymptotically de Sitter. We discuss the relevance of such configurations to dS\/CFT correspondence. When the black hole mass reaches a critical value that depends on the brane tension, the brane interpolates in the infinite past and future between a dS space and a finite space of zero Hubble constant. This corresponds to a cosmological evolution without a Big Bang or a Big Crunch. Moreover, the central charge of the CFT dual to the dS brane enters the Cardy-Verlinde formula that gives the entropy of the thermal CFT dual to the bulk AdS black hole.",
                "We discuss a method of calculating analytically the asymptotic form of quasi-normal frequencies for large AdS black holes in five dimensions. In this case, the wave equation reduces to a Heun equation. We show that the Heun equation may be approximated by a hypergeometric equation at large frequencies. Thus we obtain the asymptotic form of quasi-normal frequencies in agreement with numerical results. We also present a simple monodromy argument that leads to the same results. We include a comparison with the three-dimensional case in which exact expressions are derived."

He did his graduate work at the California Institute of Technology, where he received an M.S. (1983) and a Ph.D. (1987) in Physics. After spending four years at Texas A&M University as a Research Associate, he joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Tennessee in 1991. His CV is available here Dr. Siopsis is a theoretical particle physicist currently working on quantum computing and quantum information processing. Together with collaborators at ORNL, he has built a quantum optics laboratory for quantum cryptography, and in particular, measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution in free space, as well as quantum position verification. He has established a fruitful collaboration with ARL and its partners, such as JQI at the University of Maryland, studying topological quantum walks and quantum games with an eye toward elucidating the structure of topological materials and quantum network applications. He has been developing quantum algorithms (quantum machine learning, quantum field theory, quantum walks, quantum games, etc.) and implementing them on existing quantum hardware (IBM, IonQ, D-wave). He succeeded in getting the University of Tennessee and ARL sign a CRADA that establishes commitment to a long-term collaboration between the two Institutions in quantum information processing with a focus on quantum networks. In August 2019, he was awarded a NSF conceptualization grant to explore the creation of a Quantum Leap Challenge Institute at UTK.
