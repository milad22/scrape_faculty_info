Taft Associate Professor of Physics She\/her\/hers EVN 209 203-432-3720 \/ 203-436-8501 sarah.demers@yale.edu Experimental Particle Physics Ph.D., University of Rochester, 2005 Demers Group @ Yale ATLAS Mu2e Teaching interdisciplinary Research Public Engagement Our group focuses on using tau leptons to probe for and characterize physics beyond the standard model at the ATLAS Experiment at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider. We are also involved in hunting for signs of new physics at the Mu2e Experiment at Fermilab. Current projects include the search for the Higgs boson in the VH production mode using decays to tau lepton pairs at ATLAS and the trigger of the Mu2e Experiment. Demers co-convenes the ATLAS Upgrade Physics group and she is the chair of the US ATLAS Institute Board. For Mu2e her group is heavily engaged with the trigger development, she is on the publications board, and she leads the \u201cEngaging Non-Experts\u201d group to help new people transition into the collaboration by developing computing tutorials and documentation.
