                "The Russian-American experiment SAGE began to measure the solar neutrino capture rate with a target of gallium metal in December 1989. Measurements have continued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. In this article we present the experimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in December 2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the period of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through December 2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of 65. 4\u2212 3. 0+ 3. 1 (stat)\u2212 2. 8+ 2. 6 (syst) SNU.

                "Fifteen measurements of the solar neutrino flux have been made in a radiochemical 71Ga-71Ge experiment employing initially 30 t and later 57 t of liquid metallic gallium at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory between January 1990 and May 1992. This provides an integral measurement of the flux of solar neutrinos and in particular is sensitive to the dominant, low-energy p-p solar neutrinos. SAGE observed the capture rate to be 73\u221216+18 (stat.)\u22127+5 (syst.) SNU. This represents only 56%\u221260% of the capture rate predicted by different Standard Solar Models.",
                "The solar neutrino capture rate measured by SAGE is well below that predicted by solar models. To check the overall experimental efficiency, we exposed 13 tonnes of Ga metal to a reactor-produced 517 kCi source of 51 Cr. The ratio of the measured production rate to that predicted from the source activity is 0.95\u00b10.11 (stat)+ 0.05\/\u2212 0.08 (syst). This agreement verifies that the experimental efficiency is measured correctly, establishes that there are no unknown systematic errors at the 10% level, and provides considerable evidence for the reliability of the solar neutrino measurement.",
