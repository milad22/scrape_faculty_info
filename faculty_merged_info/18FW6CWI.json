                "We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass ( ) and redshift z in the All\u2010Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to   at  , with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to  , we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 \u03bcm photometry, optical\u2010NIR   measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct \u201cmain sequence\u201d (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given   and z (  dex), and   approximately proportional to  . The range of   remains constant to  , while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend \u223c67%(95%) of their lifetime since   within a factor of \u22722(4) of their average SFR at a given   and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of \u2026",
                "The DEEP2 and COMBO\u201017 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to  . The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After  ,   has dimmed by 1.2\u20131.3 mag for all colors of galaxies,   for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and   for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is \u223c0.5 dex). Luminosity density   has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since  , whereas those of red galaxies (near  ) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario \u2026",
                "Stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. As this is relatively rare in the local Universe, galaxies like the Milky Way form only a few new stars per year. Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly 1, 2. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars 3, 4, 5, and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts< z> of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40% and 24% of its current age. Our measurements reveal that distant star \u2026",
                "We use the first systematic data sets of CO molecular line emission in z\u223c 1\u20133 normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs) for a comparison of the dependence of galaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and high redshifts, and in different galactic environments. Although the current high-z samples are still small and biased towards the luminous and massive tail of the actively star-forming \u2018main-sequence\u2019, a fairly clear picture is emerging. Independent of whether galaxy-integrated quantities or surface densities are considered, low- and high-z SFG populations appear to follow similar molecular gas\u2013star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2, over three orders of magnitude in gas mass or surface density. The gas-depletion time-scale in these SFGs grows from 0.5 Gyr at z\u223c 2 to 1.5 Gyr at z\u223c 0. The average corresponds to a fairly low star formation efficiency of 2 per cent per dynamical \u2026",
                "We present PHIBSS, the IRAM Plateau de Bure high-z blue sequence CO 3-2 survey of the molecular gas properties in massive, main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cosmic star formation peak. PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z~ 1.2 and 2.2, with log (M*(M\u2609))\u2265 10.4 and log (SFR (M\u2609\/yr))\u2265 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M*-SFR plane, and adopting a\" Galactic\" value for the CO-H 2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of~ 0.33 at z~ 1.2 and~ 0.47 at z~ 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z~ 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV\/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z= 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a~ 0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes \u2026",
                "We characterize the mass\u2010dependent evolution of more than 8000 galaxies using spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey in the range   and stellar masses calculated from K\u2010band photometry obtained at Palomar Observatory. This sample spans more than 1.5 deg2 in four independent fields. Using rest\u2010frame   color and [O ii] equivalent widths, we distinguish star\u2010forming from passive populations in order to explore the nature of ``downsizing''\u2014a pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high\u2010mass galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epochs. We identify a mass limit, MQ, above which star formation appears to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution in this threshold mass. We find that MQ decreases with time by a factor of \u223c3 across our redshift range \u2026"
