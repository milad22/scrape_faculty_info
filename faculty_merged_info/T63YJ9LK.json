                "The goal of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical origin. Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech\u2013MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21. With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of \u2026",
                "We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr\u2212 1 per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr\u2212 1 MWEG\u2212 1 to 1000 Myr\u2212 1 MWEG\u2212 1 (Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data \u2026",
                "Around the globe several observatories are seeking the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves are predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity 1 and are generated, for example, by black-hole binary systems 2. Present GW detectors are Michelson-type kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance changes between mirrors suspended in vacuum. The sensitivity of these detectors at frequencies above several hundred hertz is limited by the vacuum (zero-point) fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. A quantum technology\u2014the injection of squeezed light 3\u2014offers a solution to this problem. Here we demonstrate the squeezed-light enhancement of GEO 600, which will be the GW observatory operated by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration in its search for GWs for the next 3\u20134 years. GEO 600 now operates with its best ever sensitivity, which proves the usefulness of \u2026"

Taraphder and T. A. Kaplan, under preparation) A major part of my NSF CRG (Chemical Research Group) research program (Billinge, Hogan, Kanazidis, Mahanti, Pinnavaia, Thorpe) involves a fundamental understanding of the physics of self-assembly of amphiphiles and physical properties of confined particles inside meso- and nanoporous media. The types of porous media we are concerned with have pore sizes ranging from several angstroms (as in Zeolites) to about 50 angstroms (as in MCM41 and novel systems discovered at MSU by Prof. Pinnavaia's group). We have developed a very efficient model to study via computer simulation the self-assembly problem and have been able to understand the physics of micellar formation and both co-operative and non co-operative routes to the formation of ordered structures. With Aniket Bhattacharya , who was a research associate here and is now an Assistant professor at the University of Central Florida, I am working on the temperature dependence of the critical micelle concentration using 3-dimensional lattice simulations. We have proposed a new way to look at this problem by monitoring the peak in the heat capacity as a function of temperature near the micellar transition. With Prof. Pinnavaia, we are exploring the possibility of using proto-zeolitic nano-clusters in enhancing the structural stability of nanoporous materials. Hoang Khang (grad student) and Hong Li (research associate) are involved in this project."
