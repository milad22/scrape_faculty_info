                "Tae Min Hong Assistant Professor 412 Allen Hall (412) 383-4081 tmhong@pitt.edu Tae Min Hong is an Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh. He is an experimental particle physicist interested in questions related to the fundamental forces of Nature and the basic building blocks of the Universe. Professor Hong is currently studying proton collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Geneva, Switzerland. As a member of the ATLAS Collaboration of about 3000 physicists, his significant contributions are in the trigger system and the discovery of the Higgs boson . The Higgs boson is the physical remnant of the once unified interactions of the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force. His work in the Higgs focused on its decay to a pair of the charged carriers of the weak force ( H \u2192 WW ) and in its production by the collision of charged and neutral carriers of the weak force ( W or Z bosons) called \"vector boson fusion\" (VBF).\u00a0 His current research involves using similar techniques to search for new fundamental particles such as non-standard Higgs bosons, dark matter candidates, supersymmetric particles, or any such new phenomena.\u00a0 The research touches on three of the five scientific drivers listed by the P5 report: Use the Higgs boson as a new tool for discovery; identify the new physics of dark matter; and explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles. Professor Hong received his AB in physics and mathematics from Harvard University and his MA and PhD in physics from the University of California at Santa Barbara. He worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania before joining the Pitt faculty in 2015. Here is his faculty profile ; now in the newspaper !
