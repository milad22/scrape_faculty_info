                "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5\u00d7 10 18 eV, derived from 20 000 events recorded at the Pierre Auger Observatory, is described. The spectral index \u03b3 of the particle flux, J\u221d E\u2212 \u03b3, at energies between 4\u00d7 10 18 eV and 4\u00d7 10 19 eV is 2.69\u00b10.02 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst), steepening to 4.2\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst) at higher energies. The hypothesis of a single power law is rejected with a significance greater than 6 standard deviations. The data are consistent with the prediction by Greisen and by Zatsepin and Kuz\u2019min.",
                "Construction of the first stage of the Pierre Auger Observatory has begun. The aim of the Observatory is to collect unprecedented information about cosmic rays above 10 18 eV. The first phase of the project, the construction and operation of a prototype system, known as the engineering array, has now been completed. It has allowed all of the sub-systems that will be used in the full instrument to be tested under field conditions. In this paper, the properties and performance of these sub-systems are described and their success illustrated with descriptions of some of the events recorded thus far.",
                "We describe the measurement of the depth of maximum, X max\ufeff, of the longitudinal development of air showers induced by cosmic rays. Almost 4000 events above 10 18 eV observed by the fluorescence detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory in coincidence with at least one surface detector station are selected for the analysis. The average shower maximum was found to evolve with energy at a rate of (106\u2212 21+ 35) g\/cm 2\/decade below 10 18.24\u00b10.05 eV, and (24\u00b13) g\/cm 2\/decade above this energy. The measured shower-to-shower fluctuations decrease from about 55 to 26 g\/cm 2. The interpretation of these results in terms of the cosmic ray mass composition is briefly discussed.",
                "We report a measurement of the flux of cosmic rays with unprecedented precision and statistics using the Pierre Auger Observatory. Based on fluorescence observations in coincidence with at least one surface detector we derive a spectrum for energies above 10 18 eV. We also update the previously published energy spectrum obtained with the surface detector array. The two spectra are combined addressing the systematic uncertainties and, in particular, the influence of the energy resolution on the spectral shape. The spectrum can be described by a broken power law E\u2212 \u03b3 with index \u03b3= 3.3 below the ankle which is measured at log 10 (E ankle\/eV)= 18.6. Above the ankle the spectrum is described by a power law with index 2.6 followed by a flux suppression, above about log 10 (E\/eV)= 19.5, detected with high statistical significance.",

                "Data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration, Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than \u223c6 \u00d7 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than \u223c75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuz\u2019min effect).

Auger was built to explore the astrophysical origins of the highest energy particles. Our group at CWRU is one of several active US groups participating in the international collaboration. As group leader, I serve on the 15-member Auger Technical Board, directly involved in all aspects of decisions related to instrument performance, calibrations, operations and data integrity. Instrumentation specialties for the CWRU group include photodetection systems, GPS timing, and wireless communications for data transfer and instrument control. Our group also is involved in several major aspects of science analysis, and in the development of new detectors for the next generation instrument. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory The Cherenkov Telescope Array [CTA] is an international initiative for global facility for gamma-ray astronomy. CTA is a major project to build a global telescope system for gamma-ray astronomy. The CWRU group works with US collaborators to develop and deploy a new technology (silicon photomultipler) camera system into a novel telescope design. The CWRU group is responsible for GPS timing, synchronization, and rapid trigger processing. The prototype system is being deployed at Mt. Hopkins Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. Since August 2018, the CWRU group is funded as part of a new MRI grant to complete the full-sized camera for the telescope.
