                "The current understanding of astrophysical magnetic fields is reviewed, focusing on their generation and maintenance by turbulence. In the astrophysical context this generation is usually explained by a self-excited dynamo, which involves flows that can amplify a weak \u2018seed\u2019 magnetic field exponentially fast. Particular emphasis is placed on the nonlinear saturation of the dynamo. Analytic and numerical results are discussed both for small scale dynamos, which are completely isotropic, and for large scale dynamos, where some form of parity breaking is crucial. Central to the discussion of large scale dynamos is the so-called alpha effect which explains the generation of a mean field if the turbulence lacks mirror symmetry, i.e. if the flow has kinetic helicity. Large scale dynamos produce small scale helical fields as a waste product that quench the large scale dynamo and hence the alpha effect. With this in mind, the \u2026",
                "We discuss current observational and theoretical knowledge of magnetic fields, especially the large-scale structure in the disks and halos of spiral galaxies. Among other topics, we consider the enhancement of global magnetic fields in the interarm regions, magnetic spiral arms, and representations as superpositions of azimuthal modes, emphasizing a number of unresolved questions. It is argued that a turbulent hydromagnetic dynamo of some kind and an inverse cascade of magnetic energy gives the most plausible explanation for the regular galactic magnetic fields. Primordial theory is found to be unsatisfactory, and fields of cosmological origin may not even be able to provide a seed field for a dynamo. Although dynamo theory has its own problems, the general form of the dynamo equations appears quite robust. Finally, detailed models of magnetic field generation in galaxies, allowing for factors \u2026",
                "The nonlinear evolution of magnetized Keplerian shear flows is simulated in a local, three-dimensional model, including the effects of compressibility and stratification. Supersonic flows are initially generated by the Balbus-Hawley magnetic shear instability. The resulting flows regenerate a turbulent magnetic field which, in turn, reinforces the turbulence. Thus, the system acts like a dynamo that generates its own turbulence. However, unlike usual dynamos, the magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy of the turbulence by a factor of 3-10. By assuming the field to be vertical on the outer (upper and lower) surfaces we do not constrain the horizontal magnetic flux. Indeed, a large-scale toroidal magnetic field is generated, mostly in the form of toroidal flux tubes with lengths comparable to the toroidal extent of the box. This large-scale field is mainly of even (ie, quadrupolar) parity with respect to the midplane and \u2026",
                "A numerical model of isotropic homogeneous turbulence with helical forcing is investigated. The resulting flow, which is essentially the prototype of the \u03b12 dynamo of mean field dynamo theory, produces strong dynamo action with an additional large\u2010scale field on the scale of the box (at wavenumber  ; forcing is at  ). This large\u2010scale field is nearly force free and exceeds the equipartition value. As the magnetic Reynolds number Rm increases, the saturation field strength and the growth rate of the dynamo increase. However, the time it takes to build up the large\u2010scale field from equipartition to its final superequipartition value increases with magnetic Reynolds number. The large\u2010scale field generation can be identified as being due to nonlocal interactions originating from the forcing scale, which is characteristic of the \u03b1\u2010effect. Both \u03b1 and turbulent magnetic diffusivity \u03b7t are determined simultaneously using numerical \u2026",
                "Arguments for and against the widely accepted picture of a solar dynamo being seated in the tachocline are reviewed, and alternative ideas concerning dynamos operating in the bulk of the convection zone, or perhaps even in the near\u2010surface shear layer, are discussed. Based on the angular velocities of magnetic tracers, it is argued that the observations are compatible with a distributed dynamo that may be strongly shaped by the near\u2010surface shear layer. Direct simulations of dynamo action in a slab with turbulence and shear are presented to discuss filling factor and tilt angles of bipolar regions in such a model.",
                "Nonhelical hydromagnetic forced turbulence is investigated using large scale simulations on up to 256 processors and 1024 3 mesh points. The magnetic Prandtl number is varied between 1\u2215 8 and 30, although in most cases it is unity. When the magnetic Reynolds number is based on the inverse forcing wave number, the critical value for dynamo action is shown to be around 35 for magnetic Prandtl number of unity. For small magnetic Prandtl numbers we find the critical magnetic Reynolds number to increase with decreasing magnetic Prandtl number. The Kazantsev k 3\u2215 2 spectrum for magnetic energy is confirmed for the kinematic regime, ie, when nonlinear effects are still unimportant and when the magnetic Prandtl number is unity. In the nonlinear regime, the energy budget converges for large Reynolds numbers (around 1000) such that for our parameters about 70% is in kinetic energy and about 30% is in \u2026",
                "We further explore nondimensional relationships between the magnetic dynamo cycle period Pcyc, the rotational period  , the activity level (as observed in Ca ii HK), and other stellar properties by expanding the stellar sample studied in the first paper in this series. We do this by adding photometric and other cycles seen in active stars and the secondaries of CV systems and by selectively adding less certain cycles from the Mount Wilson HK survey; evolved stars, long\u2010term HK trends and secondary   are also considered. We confirm that most stars with age   Gyr occupy two roughly parallel branches, separated by a factor of \u223c6 in  , with the ratio of cycle and rotational frequencies  , where Ro is the Rossby number. Using the model of the first paper in this series, this result implies that the \u03b1 effect increases with mean magnetic field (contrary to the traditional \u03b1\u2010quenching concept) and that \u03b1 and   decrease with t. Stars \u2026",
                "Results are presented from direct simulations of turbulent compressible hydromagnetic convection above a stable overshoot layer. Spontaneous dynamo action occurs followed by saturation, with most of the generated magnetic field appearing as coherent flux tubes in the vicinity of strong downdrafts, where both the generation and destruction of magnetic field is most vigorous. Whether or not this field is amplified depends on the sizes of the magnetic Reynolds and magnetic Prandtl numbers. Joule dissipation is balanced mainly by the work done against the magnetic curvature force. It is this curvature force which is also responsible for the saturation of the dynamo.",
                "We investigate hydromagnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding universe. We present the basic, covariant MHD equations, find solutions for MHD waves in the early universe, and investigate the equations numerically for random magnetic fields in two spatial dimensions. We find the formation of magnetic structures at larger and larger scales as time goes on. In three dimensions we use a cascade (shell) model that has been rather successful in the study of certain aspects of hydrodynamic turbulence. Using such a model we find that after\u223c 10 9 times the initial time the scale of the magnetic field fluctuation (in the comoving frame) has increased by 4-5 orders of magnitude as a consequence of an inverse cascade effect (ie, transfer of energy from smaller to larger scales). Thus at large scales primordial magnetic fields are considerably stronger than \u2026",
                "We use three-dimensional simulations to study compressible convection in a rotating frame with magnetic elds and overshoot into surrounding stable layers. The, initially weak, magnetic eld is ampli ed and maintained by dynamo action and becomes organised into ux tubes that are wrapped around vortex tubes. We also observe vortex buoyancy which causes upward ows in the cores of extended downdrafts. An analysis of the angles between various vector elds shows that there is a tendency for the magnetic eld to be parallel or antiparallel to the vorticity vector, especially when the magnetic eld is strong. The magnetic energy spectrum has a short inertial range with a slope compatible with k+ 1= 3 during the early growth phase of the dynamo. During the saturated state the slope is compatible with k? 1. A simple analysis based on various characteristic timescales and energy transfer rates highlights important qualitative ideas regarding the energy budget of hydromagnetic dynamos."

His main interests are concerned with magnetic field generation from turbulent motions with applications to the Sun and stars, accretion discs, galaxies, and the early Universe. He produced the first compressible dynamo simulations in 1992. His work on accretion disc turbulence in 1995 was the first to show that the magneto-rotational and dynamo instabilities lead to a sustained doubly-positive feedback. The idea that large-scale primordial fields are the result of an inverse cascade goes back to his initial work of 1996. In 2005, he developed the concept of a distributed solar dynamo shaped by the near-surface shear layer. He contributed to the discovery of several new dynamo effects and found the production of magnetic spots as a generic result of stratification in hydromagnetic turbulence. Since 2011, he has developed and applied new methods of determining magnetic helicity at the solar surface and in the solar wind. His work on the interpretation of stellar activity cycles revealed that all late-type stars younger than 2.3 billion years exhibit two cycle periods. He is also responsible for the maintenance of the Pencil Code , a public domain code for solving partial differential equations on massively parallel machines. Brandenburg, A., & Giampapa, M.
