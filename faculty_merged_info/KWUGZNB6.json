                "In this study, the intestinal microbiota of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) was examined by molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA. The aims of the study were to evaluate the use of molecular-based techniques, Polymerase Chain Reaction\/Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR\u2013DGGE) and clone library analyses, and compare the results obtained by the two methods. Total DNA was extracted from the intestine of Chinese shrimp. Then population fingerprints of the predominant microbiota were generated by DGGE analysis of universal V3 16S rDNA PCR amplicons, and 22 distinct bands from DGGE were sequenced. In addition, bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with universal bacterial primers 27F and 1387R. Amplicons were ligated into cloning vectors and near-full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts were analyzed. A clone library was constructed and 72 clones were sequenced. The results \u2026",
                "Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from one electrical plug-in type of pine-scented air freshener and their reactions with O3 were investigated in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indoor air research large chamber facility. Ozone was generated from a device marketed as an ozone generator air cleaner. Ozone and oxides of nitrogen concentrations and chamber conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and air exchange rate were controlled and\/or monitored. VOC emissions and some of the reaction products were identified and quantified. Source emission models were developed to predict the time\/concentration profiles of the major VOCs (limonene, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, 3-carene, camphene, benzyl propionate, benzyl alcohol, bornyl acetate, isobornyl acetate, and benzaldehyde) emitted by the air freshener. Gas-phase reactions of VOCs from the air freshener with O3 were \u2026",
                "1,3-Butadiene, classified as hazardous in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, is an important ambient air pollutant. Understanding its atmospheric transformation is useful for its own sake, and is also helpful for eliciting isoprene's fate in the atmosphere (isoprene dominates the biogenic emissions in US). In this paper, samples from both hydroxyl- and ozone-initiated photooxidation of 1,3-butadiene were analyzed by derivatization with O- (2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine followed by separation and detection by gas chromatography\/ion trap mass spectrometry to detect and identify carbonyl compounds. The following carbonyls were observed: formaldehyde, acrolein, glycolaldehyde, glycidaldehyde, 3-hydroxy-propanaldehyde, hydroxy acetone, and malonaldehyde, which can be classified into three categories: epoxy carbonyls, hydroxyl carbonyls, and di-carbonyls. Three non-carbonyls, furan, 1,3 \u2026",
                "To better understand fates of aromatics hydrocarbon species in the atmosphere, we have investigated the transformation chemistry of butenedial (CHOCHCHCHO), 4-oxo-2-pentenal (CH3COCHCHCHO), and 3-hexene-2, 5-dione (CH3COCHCHCOCH3). These 1,4-unsaturated dicarbonyls are known to be products of aromatic photochemical oxidation. Both hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O3) initiated smog chamber experiments under atmospheric conditions were conducted in the University of North Carolina outdoor smog chamber. Carbonyl intermediates and products were measured using the O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine derivatization method followed by gas chromatography\/ion trap mass spectrometry analysis. Carbonyl products detected and identified by comparison with standards in the OH-initiated photooxidation of butenedial include formaldehyde, acrolein, glycolaldehyde, glyoxal \u2026",
                "The Chinese Government established an industrial environmental management system to execute its pollutants gross control policy in 2006. A key component of this system is the Best Available Techniques (BAT) determination method and pollution control management. This paper augments BAT with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to create a technology selection model for thermal power techniques as case study. Emissions reduction and energy conservation potentials can be weighed against technological feasibility to create best fit assessments for a wide variety of power generation installations. Using this model improves the ability of policymakers and plant owners alike to plan appropriate technology consolidation and upgrade paths.",
                "Purpose.: To develop a mechanical model with which to investigate the relationship between the crimping morphology of collagen fibrils and the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the cornea.Methods.: Uniaxial tensile experiments were performed with corneal strips to test their mechanical behavior. A constitutive model was constructed based on the Gaussian-distributed morphology of crimped collagen fibrils. The parameters that represent the micro characteristics of collagen fibrils were determined by fitting the experimental data to the constitutive model. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to visualize the crimping morphology of collagen fibrils in the stroma. A quantitative analysis of fibril crimping degrees in the TEM images was conducted to test the parameters predicted by the constitutive model.Results.: The parameters were derived using a fitting method that included the expectation for the distribution of fibril crimping degrees, \u03bc= 1.063; the standard deviation, \u03c3= 0.0781; the elastic modulus of collagen fibrils, E= 52.74 MPa; and the fibril ultimate strain, \u03b5 b= 0.1957. TEM images showed a variation of the fibril crimping morphology when the cornea was subjected to different tensile loads. A good agreement was found between the parameters derived by the constitutive model and the data quantified from the TEM images.Conclusions.: The nonlinear mechanical behavior of the cornea is closely correlated with the crimping morphology of collagen fibrils. The findings are expected to guide further research of corneal pathologies related to the abnormal microstructure of collagen fibrils.",
                "Certain perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) in consumer products used indoors are potential indoor PFCs sources and have been associated with developmental toxicity and other adverse health effects in laboratory animals (Lao et al., 2007). The concentrations of selected PFCs including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), in 35 selected consumer products that are commonly used in indoors were measured from the year of 2007 through 2011. The products collected included carpet, commercial carpet-care liquids, household carpet\/fabric-care liquids, treated apparel, treated home textiles, treated non-woven medical garments, floor waxes, food-contact paper, membranes for apparel, and thread-sealant tapes. They were purchased from retail outlets in the United States between March 2007 and September 2011. The perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) contents in the products \u2026",
                "In international joint ventures (IJVs), management control exerted by parent firms is fundamental since it can direct employees' activities to strive for the overall goals, to safeguard parent firms' idiosyncratic investments and to decrease opportunistic behaviors. Using a meta-analytic approach, we investigate the main factors influencing management control in IJVs. A search of the published and unpublished literature uncovered 45 articles that yielded 329 reported correlations between the factors and management control with a total sample size of 15,252 IJVs. Results indicate that the factors can be ordered in the following way in terms of the average size of their association with management control: resource contribution; equity share; trust; and strategic importance to the IJVs. Three moderators including operating country (China versus other countries), industry type (manufacturing versus service) and \u2026",
                "China's calcium carbide output has dominated the global market for several years, driven by the demand for PVC (polyvinyl chloride), a fundamental polymer material and also the primary downstream product of calcium carbide in China. The fast growth of this energy-intensive industry leads to an inevitable increase in CO2 emissions. However, there is a large reduction potential with process improvement in this industry which is currently characterized by widespread outdated facilities. In this study, we attempt to assess the reduction potential of CO2 emissions in China's calcium carbide production, based on the analysis of CO2 emission patterns and estimation of the emission amount. Three scenarios regarding process improvement are employed to conduct this assessment. The results imply that the cumulative CO2 abatement in the Current Policy Scenario and in the Strengthened Policy Scenario from 2008 to \u2026"
