                "In a previous study, we reported on a systematic literature review (SLR), based on a manual search of 13 journals and conferences undertaken in the period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2007.The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search.We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study.Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is \u2026",
                "Different advances have been made in the development of software process improvement (SPI) standards and models, e.g. capability maturity model (CMM), more recently CMMI, and ISO's SPICE. However, these advances have not been matched by equal advances in the adoption of these standards and models in software development which has resulted in limited success for many SPI efforts. The current problem with SPI is not a lack of standard or model, but rather a lack of an effective strategy to successfully implement these standards or models. The importance of SPI implementation demands that it be recognised as a complex process in its own right and that organizations should determine their SPI implementation maturity through an organized set of activities. In the literature, much attention has been paid to \u201cwhat activities to implement\u201d instead of \u201chow to implement\u201d these activities. We believe that \u2026",
                "This paper explores why organizations do not adopt CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration), by analysing two months of sales data collected by an Australian company selling CMMI appraisal and improvement services. The most frequent reasons given by organizations were: the organization was small; the services were too costly, the organization had no time, and the organization was using another SPI approach. Overall, we found small organizations not adopting CMMI tend to say that adopting it would be infeasible, but do not say it would be unbeneficial. We comment on the significance of our findings and research method for SPI research.",
                "In this article, we present findings from our recent empirical study of the critical success factors (CSFs) for software process improvement (SPI) implementation with 34 SPI practitioners. The objective of this study is to provide SPI practitioners with sufficient knowledge about the nature of issues that play a positive role in the implementation of SPI programmes in order to assist them in effectively planning SPI implementation strategies.Through our empirical study we identified seven factors (higher management support, training, awareness, allocation of resources, staff involvement, experienced staff and defined SPI implementation methodology) that are generally considered critical for successfully implementing SPI. We also report on a literature survey of CSFs that impact SPI and identify six factors (senior management commitment, staff involvement, staff time and resources, training and mentoring, creating process \u2026",
                "Systematic review is a method to identify, assess and analyse published primary studies to investigate research questions. We critique recently published guidelines for performing systematic reviews on software engineering, and comment on systematic review generally with respect to our experience conducting one. Overall we recommend the guidelines. We recommend researchers clearly and narrowly define research questions to reduce overall effort, and to improve selection and data extraction. We suggest that \u201ccomplementary\u201d research questions can help clarify the main questions and define selection criteria. We show our project timeline, and discuss possibilities for automating and increasing the acceptance of systematic review.",
                "Background: Software Process Improvement (SPI) is intended to improve software engineering, but can only be effective if used. To improve SPI\u2019s uptake, we should understand why organizations adopt SPI. CMM-based SPI approaches are widely known and studied. Objective: We investigated why organizations adopt CMM-based SPI approaches, and how these motivations relate to organizations\u2019 size. Method: We performed a systematic review, examining reasons reported in more than forty primary studies. Results: Reasons usually related to product quality and project performance, and less commonly, to process. Organizations reported customer reasons infrequently and employee reasons very rarely. We could not show that reasons related to size. Conclusion: Despite its origins in helping to address customer-related issues for the USAF, CMM-based SPI has mostly been adopted to help organizations \u2026",

We performed all the SLR steps, such as the protocol development, initial selection, final selection, quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis.We have identified factors such as cost-saving, skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure, quality of product and services, efficient outsourcing relationships management, and an organisation's track record of successful projects which are generally considered important by the \u2026",

Data extracted from each study included: (1) authors, their affiliation and publishing venue, (2) SLR quality, (3) research focus, (4) GSD risks, (5) risk mitigation strategies and, (6) for each SLR the number of primary studies reporting each risk and risk mitigation strategy.We found a total of 37 papers reporting 24 unique GSD SLR \u2026"

                "Fahad Mahmood Assistant Professor 106 Materials Research Lab (217) 300-9217 fahad@illinois.edu Fahad Mahmood Research Group Professor Fahad Mahmood is an experimentalist in condensed matter physics. He started his research lab on the femtosecond manipulation of quantum materials at the University of Illinois in August 2019. He received his B.S. from Stanford University in 2010, majoring in Physics and Aero\/Astro Engineering. He went on to receive his PhD in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016, working in the group of Nuh Gedik. There, he developed ultrafast optical and photoemission techniques to study and control emergent phenomena in a variety of quantum materials. From 2016 to 2019, Professor Mahmood was a postdoctoral research fellow in the group of Peter Armitage at Johns Hopkins University. His research used THz range spectroscopies to probe complex interactions in high-temperature and unconventional superconductors, and frustrated quantum magnets at their natural energy scales. Professor Fahad Mahmood's research lab at the University of Illinois will develop and apply non-linear optical and time-resolved photoemission spectroscopies to solve problems at the intersection of strongly correlated quantum materials and non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the principal goals is to use laser light to engineer electronic interactions in materials, probe their spatial and temporal correlations, and realize model Hamiltonians and novel phases of matter. Typical experiments will use a laser pulse to perturb a particular material in different ways, e.g., by coupling to charge or spin degrees of freedom, exciting specific collective modes or modifying the local energy landscape over short (femtosecond) timescales. Custom-built spectroscopic tools such as time-resolved ARPES and time-domain THz spectroscopy will then be used to examine the resulting evolution of electronic states, measure changes in low-energy electrodynamics and disentangle coupled excitations. Projects and materials will be varied but will likely include unconventional superconductors, topological systems and frustrated magnets.

Physical Review Letters 107, 077401 (2011) Testing Anderson's  'Fermi glass' using terahertz photon echoes Many properties of metals can remarkably be understood in terms of \u201cfree\u201d electrons, even though electrons interact with each other through a Coulomb force, which can be both large and long ranged. It turns out that these interactions collectively result in the emergence of \u201cquasiparticles\u201d whose behavior is very similar to that of free, non-interacting electrons. This description forms the basis of the famous\u00a0Landau Fermi liquid theory. In fact, the notion of finding new non-interacting quasiparticles to describe complicated interacting systems is a key paradigm in condensed matter physics.
