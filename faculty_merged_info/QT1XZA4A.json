                "This study proposes to assess and empirically verify possible negative effects from the construction of wind turbines on the landscape image and tourism potential of affected areas, using the example of two comparative recreational localities in the Czech Republic: one with the construction of a wind farm planned and the other with an already existing farm. The empirical research consisted of two mutually linked parts: a questionnaire survey and focused, semi-structured interviews. Emphasis was placed on the subjective perception of the phenomenon by tourists and local business representatives from the sphere of tourism. The analysis focuses also on the social-geographical factors that shape tourists attitudes to the wind energy development dilemma.",
