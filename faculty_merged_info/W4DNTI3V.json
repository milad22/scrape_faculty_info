D., Hungary, 1967 Office: MH 5410 Phone: 858-534-6096 jkuti@physics.ucsd.edu My main research interest is focused on nonperturbative theoretical studies of the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. The primary goal in the development of general nonperturbative methods in quantum field theories has been the combination of modern computer aided stochastic methods with analytic field theoretic tools to obtain definitive results which otherwise could not be derived. The two major areas of applications in my research have been Quantum Chromodynamics where I worked on the spin structure of the nucleon and the quark deconfining phase transition of the early universe, and the Higgs sector of the Electroweak Model where I have studied the nonperturbative implications of a very heavy Higgs particle for future collider physics."
