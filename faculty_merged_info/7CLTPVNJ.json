                "Daniel Bardayan Daniel Bardayan Professor Ph.D. in Physics, 1999 Yale University B.S. in Physics, 1993 Tennessee Technological University Email: danbardayan (at) nd (dot) edu Office phone: 574-631-2172 Office: 219 Nieuwland Science Hall Experimental Nuclear Physics Prof. Bardayan\u2019s research interests are in the explosive nucleosynthesis that occurs in cataclysmic stellar events such as novae, supernovae, and X-ray bursts. In particular, he studies the exotic nuclei produced in these events via the use of transfer reactions at the TWINSOL magnetic spectrometer at the NSL, at the Gammasphere array at Argonne National Laboratory, and with the supersonic gas-jet target JENSA at Michigan State University. Prof. Bardayan has considerable experience in the construction of large-area silicon detector arrays, in the use of targets of gaseous elements, in experiments with exotic radioactive beams and their applications to astrophysical problems.
