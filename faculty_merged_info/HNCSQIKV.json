                "A common question within the context of de novo motif discovery is whether a newly discovered, putative motif resembles any previously discovered motif in an existing database. To answer this question, we define a statistical measure of motif-motif similarity, and we describe an algorithm, called Tomtom, for searching a database of motifs with a given query motif. Experimental simulations demonstrate the accuracy of Tomtom's E values and its effectiveness in finding similar motifs.",
                "Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin and comprise the structural building blocks of the living eukaryotic genome. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) has long been used to delineate nucleosomal organization. Microarray-based nucleosome mapping experiments in yeast chromatin have revealed regularly-spaced translational phasing of nucleosomes. These data have been used to train computational models of sequence-directed nuclesosome positioning, which have identified ubiquitous strong intrinsic nucleosome positioning signals. Here, we successfully apply this approach to nucleosome positioning experiments from human chromatin. The predictions made by the human-trained and yeast-trained models are strongly correlated, suggesting a shared mechanism for sequence-based determination of nucleosome occupancy. In addition, we observed striking complementarity between classifiers trained on experimental data from weakly versus heavily digested MNase samples. In the former case, the resulting model accurately identifies nucleosome-forming sequences; in the latter, the classifier excels at identifying nucleosome-free regions. Using this model we are able to identify several characteristics of nucleosome-forming and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. First, by combining results from each classifier applied de novo across the human ENCODE regions, the classifier reveals distinct sequence composition and periodicity features of nucleosome-forming and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Short runs of dinucleotide repeat appear as a hallmark of nucleosome-disfavoring sequences, while nucleosome \u2026",
                " Motivation: Alternative splicing is currently seen to explain the vast disparity between the number of predicted genes in the human genome and the highly diverse proteome. The mapping of expressed sequences tag (EST) consensus sequences derived from the GeneNest database onto the genome provides an efficient way of predicting exon\u2013intron boundaries, gene structure and alternative splicing events. However, the alternative splicing events are obscured by a large number of putatively artificial exon boundaries arising due to genomic contamination or alignment errors. The current work describes a methodology to associate quality values to the predicted exon\u2013intron boundaries. High quality exon\u2013intron boundaries are used to predict constitutive and alternative splicing ranked by confidence values, aiming to facilitate large-scale analysis of alternative splicing and splicing in general \u2026",
                "Alternative splicing contributes significantly to the complexity of the human transcriptome and proteome. Computational prediction of alternative splice isoforms are usually based on EST sequences that also allow to approximate the expression pattern of the related transcripts. However, the limited number of tissues represented in the EST data as well as the different cDNA construction protocols may influence the predictive capacity of ESTs to unravel tissue-specifically expressed transcripts. We predict tissue and tumor specific splice isoforms based on the genomic mapping (SpliceNest) of the EST consensus sequences and library annotation provided in the GeneNest database. We further ascertain the potentially rare tissue specific transcripts as the ones represented only by ESTs derived from normalized libraries. A subset of the predicted tissue and tumor specific isoforms are then validated via RT-PCR experiments over a spectrum of 40 tissue types. Our strategy revealed 427 genes with at least one tissue specific transcript as well as 1120 genes showing tumor specific isoforms. While our experimental evaluation of computationally predicted tissue-specific isoforms revealed a high success rate in confirming the expression of these isoforms in the respective tissue, the strategy frequently failed to detect the expected restricted expression pattern. The analysis of putative lowly expressed transcripts using normalized cDNA libraries suggests that our ability to detect tissue-specific isoforms strongly depends on the expression level of the respective transcript as well as on the sensitivity of the experimental methods. Especially splice isoforms \u2026",
                "Nucleosome occupancy plays a key role in regulating access to eukaryotic genomes. Although various chromatin regulatory complexes are known to regulate nucleosome occupancy, the role of DNA sequence in this regulation remains unclear, particularly in mammals. To address this problem, we measured nucleosome distribution at high temporal resolution in human cells at hundreds of genes during the reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma\u2013associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We show that nucleosome redistribution peaks at 24 h post-KSHV reactivation and that the nucleosomal redistributions are widespread and transient. To clarify the role of DNA sequence in these nucleosomal redistributions, we compared the genes with altered nucleosome distribution to a sequence-based computer model and in vitro\u2013assembled nucleosomes. We demonstrate that both the predicted model and the assembled nucleosome \u2026",
                " T-STAG (tissue-specific transcripts and genes) is a resource and web-interface, designated to analyze tissue\/tumor-specific expression patterns in human and mouse transcriptomes. It integrates our refined prediction of specific expression patterns both in genes as well as in individual isoforms with man\u2013mouse orthology data. In combination with the features for combining\/contrasting the genes expressed in different tissues, T-STAG implicates important biological applications, such as the detection of differentially expressed genes in tumors, the retrieval of orthologs with significant expression in the same tissue etc. Additionally, our refined categorization of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) according to the normalization of cDNA libraries allows searching for putative low-abundant transcripts. The results are tightly linked to our visualization tools, GeneNest (expression patterns of genes) and SpliceNest (gene \u2026",
                "Most high-throughput experimental results of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are seemingly inconsistent with each other. In this article, we re-evaluated these contradictions within the context of the underlying domain-domain interactions (DDIs) for two Escherichia coli and four Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI datasets derived from high-throughput (yeast two-hybrid and tandem affinity purification) experimental platforms. For shared DDIs across pairs of compared datasets, we observed a remarkably high pair-wise correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient between 0.80 and 0.84) between datasets of the same organism derived from the same experimental platform. To a lesser degree, this concordance also held true for more general inter-platform and intra-species comparisons (Pearson correlation coefficient between 0.52 and 0.89). Thus, although varying experimental conditions can influence the ability of \u2026"
