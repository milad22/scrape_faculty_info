                "The general low-energy theory of electrons interacting via repulsive short-range interactions on graphene\u2019s honeycomb lattice at half-filling is presented. The exact symmetry of the Lagrangian with local quartic terms for the Dirac four-component field dictated by the lattice is identified as D 2\u00d7 U c (1)\u00d7 time reversal, where D 2 is the dihedral group, and U c (1) is a subgroup of the SU c (2)\u201cchiral\u201d group of the noninteracting Lagrangian that represents translations in Dirac language. The Lagrangian describing spinless particles respecting this symmetry is parametrized by six independent coupling constants. We show how first imposing the rotational, then Lorentz, and finally chiral symmetry to the quartic terms\u2014in conjunction with the Fierz transformations\u2014eventually reduces the set of couplings to just two, in the \u201cmaximally symmetric\u201d local interacting theory. We identify the two critical points in such a Lorentz and \u2026",
                "A spatially nonuniform superconducting phase is proposed as the electronic variational ground state for the attractive interactions between nearest neighbors on graphene\u2019s honeycomb lattice, close to and right at the filling one half. The state spontaneously breaks the translational invariance of the lattice into the Kekule pattern of bond order parameters, and it is gapped, spin triplet, and odd under the sublattice exchange. With the increase in attractive interactions we first find the transition from the semimetallic phase into the p-Kekule superconductor, defined as being odd under the exchange of Dirac points, with the additional discontinuous superconductor-superconductor transition into the even s-Kekule state, deep within the superconducting phase. Topological excitations of the Kekule superconductor and its competition with other superconducting states on the honeycomb lattice are discussed.",
                "Flat electronic bands can accommodate a plethora of interaction-driven quantum phases, since kinetic energy is quenched therein and electronic interactions therefore prevail. Twisted bilayer graphene, near the so-called \u201cmagic angles\u201d, features slow Dirac fermions close to the charge-neutrality point that persist up to high energies. Starting from a continuum model of slow but strongly interacting Dirac fermions, we show that with increasing chemical doping away from the charge-neutrality point, a time-reversal symmetry breaking, valley pseudospin-triplet, topological p+ i p superconductor gradually sets in, when the system resides at the brink of an antiferromagnetic ordering (due to Hubbard repulsion), in qualitative agreement with recent experimental findings. The p+ i p paired state exhibits quantized spin and thermal Hall conductivities, and polar Kerr and Faraday rotations. Our conclusions should also be \u2026",
                "We propose a general principle for constructing higher-order topological (HOT) phases. We argue that if a D-dimensional first-order or regular topological phase involves m Hermitian matrices that anticommute with additional p\u2212 1 mutually anticommuting matrices, it is conceivable to realize an n th-order HOT phase, where n= 1,..., p, with appropriate combinations of discrete symmetry-breaking Wilsonian masses. An n th-order HOT phase accommodates zero modes on a surface with codimension n. We exemplify these scenarios for prototypical three-dimensional gapless systems, such as a nodal-loop semimetal possessing SU (2) spin-rotational symmetry, and Dirac semimetals, transforming under (pseudo) spin-1 2 or 1 representations. The former system permits an unprecedented realization of a fourth-order phase, without any surface zero modes. Our construction can be generalized to HOT insulators and \u2026",
                "We study the effects of short-range interactions on a generalized three-dimensional Weyl semimetal, where the band touching points act as the (anti) monopoles of Abelian Berry curvature of strength n. We show that any local interaction has a negative scaling dimension\u2212 2\/n. Consequently, all Weyl semimetals are stable against weak short-range interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, we demonstrate that the Weyl semimetal either undergoes a first-order transition into a band insulator or a continuous transition into a symmetry breaking phase. A translational symmetry breaking axion insulator and a rotational symmetry breaking semimetal are two prominent candidates for the broken symmetry phase. At the one-loop order, the correlation length exponent for continuous transitions is \u03bd= n\/2, indicating their non-Gaussian nature for any n> 1. We also discuss the scaling of the thermodynamic and transport \u2026",
                "We study the stability of three-dimensional incompressible Weyl semimetals in the presence of random quenched charge impurities. Combining numerical analysis and scaling theory, we show that, in the presence of sufficiently weak randomness,(i) the Weyl semimetal remains stable, while (ii) the double-Weyl semimetal gives rise to compressible diffusive metal where the mean density of states at zero energy is finite. At stronger disorder, the Weyl semimetal undergoes a quantum phase transition and enter into a metallic phase. The mean density of states at zero energy serves as the order parameter and displays single-parameter scaling across such a disorder driven quantum phase transition. We numerically determine various exponents at the critical point, which appear to be insensitive to the number of Weyl pairs. We also extract the extent of the quantum critical regime in disordered Weyl semimetals and the \u2026",
                "The field theory of the semimetal-superconductor quantum phase transition for graphene and surface states of topological insulators is presented. The Lagrangian possesses the global U (1) symmetry, with the self-interacting complex bosonic order-parameter and the massless Dirac fermions coupled through a Yukawa term. The same theory also governs the quantum critical behavior of graphene near the transition towards the bond-density-wave (Kekule) insulator. The local U (1) gauged version of the theory which describes the quantum semimetal-superconductor transition in the ultimate critical regime is also considered. Due to the Yukawa coupling the transitions are found to be always continuous, both with and without the fluctuating gauge field. The critical behavior is addressed within the dimensional regularization near four space-time dimensions, and the calculation of various universal quantities \u2026",
                "We correct erroneous conclusions from our previous article [Phys. Rev. B 90, 241112 (R)(2014)] regarding the values of various critical exponents, calculated to two-loop order. Furthermore, from a three-loop renormalization group flow equation, we argue, that \u03b5-expansion near two spatial dimensions, with \u03b5= d\u2212 2, may not be reliable to address the critical properties of the disorder-driven Dirac semimetal-metal quantum phase transition in d= 3.",
                "Three-dimensional Weyl and Dirac semimetals can support a chiral-symmetry-breaking, fully gapped, charge-density-wave order even for sufficiently weak repulsive electron-electron interactions, when placed in strong magnetic fields. In the former systems, due to the natural momentum space separation of Weyl nodes the ordered phase lacks the translational symmetry and represents an axionic phase of matter, while that in a Dirac semimetal (neglecting the Zeeman coupling) is only a trivial insulator. We present the scaling of this spectral gap for a wide range of subcritical (weak) interactions as well as that of the diamagnetic susceptibility with the magnetic field. A similar mechanism for charge-density-wave ordering at weak coupling is shown to be operative in double-and triple-Weyl semimetals, where the dispersion is linear (quadratic and cubic, respectively) for the z (planar) component (s) of the momentum \u2026",
                "Topological Weyl semimetals, besides manifesting chiral anomaly, can also accommodate a disorder-driven unconventional quantum phase transition into a metallic phase. A fundamentally and practically important question in this regard concerns an experimentally measurable quantity that can clearly distinguish these two phases. We show that the optical conductivity while serving this purpose can also play the role of a bonafide order parameter across such disorder-driven semimetal-metal quantum phase transition by virtue of displaying distinct scaling behavior in the semimetallic and metallic phases, as well as inside the quantum critical fan supporting a non-Fermi liquid. We demonstrate that the correction to the dielectric constant and optical conductivity in a dirty Weyl semimetal due to weak disorder is independent of the actual nature of point-like impurity scatterers. Therefore, optical conductivity can be \u2026"
