D., Cornell, 1995 Office: MHA 5515 Phone: 858-822-3219 fkw@ucsd.edu My primary physics interest lies in searching for new phenomena at the high energy frontier with the CMS detector at the LHC. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the search for dark matter and electroweak symmetry breaking. As experimentalist, I am furthermore interested in instrumentation, and data analysis. In the last few years, this meant developing, deploying, and now operating a worldwide distributed computing system for high throughput computing with large data volumes. In 2010, \"large\" data volumes are measured in Petabytes. By 2020, we expect this to grow to Exabytes."
