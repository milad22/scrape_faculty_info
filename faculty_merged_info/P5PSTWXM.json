                "Navigation Home Teaching Research Publications Advising For Students Home Dr. Ranko Heindl I am associate professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at San Jose State University. I received my PhD in Applied Physics from University of South Florida in 2006. Subsequently, I joined the Natio nal Ins titute of Stand ard s and Tec hnology (NIS T) in Boulder, Colorado as an NRC Postdoctoral Fellow. I worked at NIST Magnetics G roup for over five years, before joinin g SJSU in 2012. My primary domains of expertise are the areas of magnetism , spintronic s and nonvolatile memories, in particular magnetic random access memories, magnetic recording materials for hard disc drive applications, magneto-resistive sensors, and high-frequency properties of magnetic thin films. I also have extensive knowledge of vacuum thin film deposition technologies, nanofabrication, thin films characterization, and device testing.
