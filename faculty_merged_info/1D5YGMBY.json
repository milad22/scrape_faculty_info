                "The ratio of the proton's elastic electromagnetic form factors, G E p\/G M p, was obtained by measuring P t and P \u2113, the transverse and the longitudinal recoil proton polarization, respectively. For elastic e\u2192 p\u2192 e p\u2192, G E p\/G M p is proportional to P t\/P \u2113. Simultaneous measurement of P t and P \u2113 in a polarimeter provides good control of the systematic uncertainty. The results for the ratio G E p\/G M p show a systematic decrease as Q 2 increases from 0.5 to 3.5 GeV 2, indicating for the first time a definite difference in the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization currents in the proton.",
                "The ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton G E p\/G M p, which is an image of its charge and magnetization distributions, was measured at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) using the recoil polarization technique. The ratio of the form factors is directly proportional to the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal components of the polarization of the recoil proton in the elastic e\u2192 p\u2192 e p\u2192 reaction. The new data presented span the range 3.5< Q 2< 5.6 GeV 2 and are well described by a linear Q 2 fit. Also, the ratio Q 2 F 2 p\/F 1 p reaches a constant value above Q 2= 2 GeV 2.",
                "The ratio of the proton elastic electromagnetic form factors, G Ep\/G Mp, was obtained by measuring P t and P \u2113, the transverse and longitudinal recoil proton polarization components, respectively, for the elastic e\u2192 p\u2192 e p\u2192 reaction in the four-momentum transfer squared range of 0.5 to 3.5 GeV 2. In the single-photon exchange approximation, G Ep\/G Mp is directly proportional to P t\/P \u2113. The simultaneous measurement of P t and P \u2113 in a polarimeter reduces systematic uncertainties. The results for G Ep\/G Mp show a systematic decrease with increasing Q 2, indicating for the first time a definite difference in the distribution of charge and magnetization in the proton. The data have been reanalyzed and their systematic uncertainties have become significantly smaller than those reported previously.",
                "We report the first measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry A PV in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from Pb 208. A PV is sensitive to the radius of the neutron distribution (R n). The result A PV= 0.656\u00b10.060 (stat)\u00b10.014 (syst) ppm corresponds to a difference between the radii of the neutron and proton distributions R n\u2212 R p= 0.33\u2212 0.18+ 0.16 fm and provides the first electroweak observation of the neutron skin which is expected in a heavy, neutron-rich nucleus.",
                "The instrumentation in Hall A at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility was designed to study electro-and photo-induced reactions at very high luminosity and good momentum and angular resolution for at least one of the reaction products. The central components of Hall A are two identical high resolution spectrometers, which allow the vertical drift chambers in the focal plane to provide a momentum resolution of better than 2\u00d7 10\u2212 4. A variety of Cherenkov counters, scintillators and lead-glass calorimeters provide excellent particle identification. The facility has been operated successfully at a luminosity well in excess of 10 38 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. The research program is aimed at a variety of subjects, including nucleon structure functions, nucleon form factors and properties of the nuclear medium.",
                "The protons and neutrons in a nucleus can form strongly correlated nucleon pairs. Scattering experiments, in which a proton is knocked out of the nucleus with high-momentum transfer and high missing momentum, show that in carbon-12 the neutron-proton pairs are nearly 20 times as prevalent as proton-proton pairs and, by inference, neutron-neutron pairs. This difference between the types of pairs is due to the nature of the strong force and has implications for understanding cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars.",
                "We present measurements of the ratio of the proton elastic electromagnetic form factors, \u03bc p G Ep\/G Mp. The Jefferson Lab Hall A Focal Plane Polarimeter was used to determine the longitudinal and transverse components of the recoil proton polarization in ep elastic scattering; the ratio of these polarization components is proportional to the ratio of the two form factors. These data reproduce the observation of Jones et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1398 (2000)], that the form factor ratio decreases significantly from unity above Q 2= 1 GeV 2.",
                "We present a search at the Jefferson Laboratory for new forces mediated by sub-GeV vector bosons with weak coupling \u03b1\u2032 to electrons. Such a particle A\u2032 can be produced in electron-nucleus fixed-target scattering and then decay to an e+ e\u2212 pair, producing a narrow resonance in the QED trident spectrum. Using APEX test run data, we searched in the mass range 175\u2013250 MeV, found no evidence for an A\u2032\u2192 e+ e\u2212 reaction, and set an upper limit of \u03b1\u2032\/\u03b1\u2243 10\u2212 6. Our findings demonstrate that fixed-target searches can explore a new, wide, and important range of masses and couplings for sub-GeV forces.",
                "We report on measurements of the neutron spin asymmetries A 1, 2 n and polarized structure functions g 1, 2 n at three kinematics in the deep inelastic region, with x= 0.33, 0.47, and 0.60 and Q 2= 2.7, 3.5, and 4.8 (GeV\u2215 c) 2, respectively. These measurements were performed using a 5.7 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam and a polarized He 3 target. The results for A 1 n and g 1 n at x= 0.33 are consistent with previous world data and, at the two higher-x points, have improved the precision of the world data by about an order of magnitude. The new A 1 n data show a zero crossing around x= 0.47 and the value at x= 0.60 is significantly positive. These results agree with a next-to-leading-order QCD analysis of previous world data. The trend of data at high x agrees with constituent quark model predictions but disagrees with that from leading-order perturbative QCD (PQCD) assuming hadron helicity \u2026",
                "We report new measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry A PV in elastic scattering of 3 GeV electrons off hydrogen and He 4 targets with\u27e8 \u03b8 lab\u27e9\u2248 6.0. The He 4 result is A PV=(+ 6.40\u00b10.23 (stat)\u00b10.12 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 6. The hydrogen result is A PV=(\u2212 1.58\u00b10.12 (stat)\u00b10.04 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 6. These results significantly improve constraints on the electric and magnetic strange form factors G E s and G M s. We extract G E s= 0.002\u00b10.014\u00b10.007 at\u27e8 Q 2\u27e9= 0.077 GeV 2, and G E s+ 0.09 G M s= 0.007\u00b10.011\u00b10.006 at\u27e8 Q 2\u27e9= 0.109 GeV 2, providing new limits on the role of strange quarks in the nucleon charge and magnetization distributions."
