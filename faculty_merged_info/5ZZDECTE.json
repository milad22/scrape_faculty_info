He is part of the international effort to understand and describe the origin of, and the fundamental constituents (and their interactions) of the Universe. He works mainly on superstring theory, quantum gravity, gauge theory, and M-theory, studying objects such as black holes and D-branes, using a variety of techniques from Mathematics and Physics.\r\n\r\nMany of the same techniques can be applied to studying aspects of strongly coupled physics that are important in other experimental fields such as nuclear physics and condensed matter physics. Johnson's work in this area has led to insights into new descriptions of phenomena relevant to the quark-gluon plasma, cold atomic gases, and various quantum critical phenomena closely related to high temperature superconductors.  Research Keywords  superstring theory, quantum gravity, M-theory, black holes, D-branes, theoretical physics, quarks, gluons, superconductors  Publications  Book      Johnson, C.

Multimedia Scholarship and Creative Works   Theatre Play, Two act play written and developed in collaboration with playwright (and school of theatre faculty) Oliver Mayer.  It is part of an outreach effort to  create works that portray  science and scientists in a dramatic setting. In 2006 it won an award (Sloan Foundation) from the Magic Theater in San Francisco to be developed further., 2006-2007  Film development , Worked with IOpenShell group in Chemistry on developing some educational videos about basic chemistry and physics projects. Co-wrote, co-directed and co-produced  the films. See results: here and here. , 04\/2008-08\/2009  Book\/ Graphic Novel, Exciting new project combining visual works with text to  bring science (physics and related topics) to a wider audience through narrative and character.
