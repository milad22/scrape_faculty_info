                "We describe here a simple, all-inorganic metal\/NC\/metal sandwich photovoltaic (PV) cell that produces an exceptionally large short-circuit photocurrent (>21 mA cm\u22122) by way of a Schottky junction at the negative electrode. The PV cell consists of a PbSe NC film, deposited via layer-by-layer (LbL) dip coating that yields an EQE of 55\u221265% in the visible and up to 25% in the infrared region of the solar spectrum, with a spectrally corrected AM1.5G power conversion efficiency of 2.1%. This NC device produces one of the largest short-circuit currents of any nanostructured solar cell, without the need for sintering, superlattice order or separate phases for electron and hole transport.",
                "Procedures for testing organic solar cell devices and modules with respect to stability and operational lifetime are described. The descriptions represent a consensus of the discussion and conclusions reached during the first 3 years of the international summit on OPV stability (ISOS). The procedures include directions for shelf life testing, outdoor testing, laboratory weathering testing and thermal cycling testing, as well as guidelines for reporting data. These procedures are not meant to be qualification tests, but rather generally agreed test conditions and practices to allow ready comparison between laboratories and to help improving the reliability of reported values. Failure mechanisms and detailed degradation mechanisms are not covered in this report.",
                "So far, one of the fundamental limitations of organic photovoltaic (OPV) device power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) has been the low voltage output caused by a molecular orbital mismatch between the donor polymer and acceptor molecules. Here, we present a means of addressing the low voltage output by introducing novel trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes (TNEFs) as acceptor materials for use in photovoltaic devices. TNEFs were discovered in 1999 by Stevenson et al. 1; for the first time derivatives of the TNEF acceptor, Lu 3 N@ C 80, are synthesized and integrated into OPV devices. The reduced energy offset of the molecular orbitals of Lu 3 N@ C 80 to the donor, poly (3-hexyl) thiophene (P3HT), reduces energy losses in the charge transfer process and increases the open circuit voltage (V oc) to 260 mV above reference devices made with [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric methyl ester (C 60-PCBM) acceptor \u2026",
                "Perovskite solar cells have made tremendous progress using laboratory-scale spin-coating methods in the past few years owing to advances in controls of perovskite film deposition. However, devices made via scalable methods are still lagging behind state-of-the-art spin-coated devices because of the complicated nature of perovskite crystallization from a precursor state. Here we demonstrate a chlorine-containing methylammonium lead iodide precursor formulation along with solvent tuning to enable a wide precursor-processing window (up to\u223c 8 min) and a rapid grain growth rate (as short as\u223c 1 min). Coupled with antisolvent extraction, this precursor ink delivers high-quality perovskite films with large-scale uniformity. The ink can be used by both spin-coating and blade-coating methods with indistinguishable film morphology and device performance. Using a blade-coated absorber, devices with 0.12-cm 2 and \u2026",
                "As organic photovoltaic efficiencies steadily improve, understanding degradation pathways becomes increasingly important. In this paper, the stability under prolonged illumination of a prototypical polymer:fullerene active layer is studied without the complications introduced by additional layers and interfaces in complete devices. Combining contactless photoconductivity with spectroscopy, structural characterization at the molecular and film level, and quantum chemical calculations, the mechanism of photoinduced degradation in bulk heterojunctions of poly (3\u2010hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]\u2010phenyl C61\u2010butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is studied. Bare films are subjected to four conditions for 1000 h with either constant illumination or dark and either ambient or inert atmosphere. All samples are found to be intrinsically stable for 1000+ h under inert conditions, in contrast to complete devices. While PCBM \u2026",
                "We report on studies of device degradation in organic photovoltaic devices based on blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Since delamination, oxidation, and chemical interactions at the metal electrode\/organic interface have long been posited as degradation pathways in organic electronic devices, we first investigated the stability of a variety of electrodes for devices stored in an inert, dark environment. Second, a set of experiments was designed to separate the effects at the metal\/organic interface from the degradation of the active layer or the hole extraction interface. To do this, Ca\/Al electrodes were deposited to complete half of a substrate's devices, and samples were left both under constant illumination and 10% illumination (10% duty cycle of 1 sun illumination) in a glovebox environment. After more than 200 h of measurement, additional electrodes \u2026",
                "CdTe solar cells have the potential to undercut the costs of electricity generated by other technologies, if the open-circuit voltage can be increased beyond 1 V without significant decreases in current. However, in the past decades, the open-circuit voltage has stagnated at around 800\u2013900 mV. This is lower than in GaAs solar cells, even though GaAs has a smaller bandgap; this is because it is more difficult to achieve simultaneously high hole density and lifetime in II\u2013VI materials than in III\u2013V materials. Here, by doping the CdTe with a Group V element, we report lifetimes in single-crystal CdTe that are nearly radiatively limited and comparable to those in GaAs over a hole density range relevant for solar applications. Furthermore, the deposition on CdTe of nanocrystalline CdS layers that form non-ideal heterointerfaces with 10% lattice mismatch impart no damage to the CdTe surface and show excellent junction \u2026",
                "All-perovskite\u2013based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells have the potential to deliver efficiencies of >30%. However, the performance of all-perovskite\u2013based tandem devices has been limited by the lack of high-efficiency, low\u2013band gap tin-lead (Sn-Pb) mixed-perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We found that the addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of Sn-Pb mixed, low\u2013band gap (~1.25 electron volt) perovskite films. The films have defect densities that are lower by a factor of 10, leading to carrier lifetimes of greater than 1 microsecond and diffusion lengths of 2.5 micrometers. These improved properties enable our demonstration of >20% efficient low\u2013band gap PSCs. When combined with wider\u2013band gap PSCs, we achieve 25% efficient four-terminal and 23.1% efficient two-terminal all-perovskite\u2013based polycrystalline thin \u2026",
                "The role of the work function and interfacial chemistry on organic device performance was investigated by using a series of contact materials. The active layer was a standard blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6-6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester. Over 100 devices were fabricated and measured to obtain good statistics. Ba\u2215Al and Ca\u2215Al electrodes performed best, with similar open-circuit voltages and power conversion efficiencies. Device stability studies showed devices with these two electrodes remained similar after six weeks with degradation of 11%\u201316% in net conversion efficiency observed. The incorporation of silver into the electrodes led to considerably more degradation than other electrode types.",
                "For organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to become a truly viable technology, it is critical to correctly identify their degradation mechanism(s) and pave the way for strategies to improve device lifetime. Changes in the active organic component are often cited as the leading degradation pathway in OPVs. In this shelf life study, we monitor device performance after storage in the dark at ambient conditions to show that decay behavior is dominated by changes at the top metal electrode and\/or the metal\u2013organic interface. Cross-sectional TEM reveals extensive void formation to be the primary degradation mechanism for Ca\/Al contacts. Kelvin probe measurements show the work function of Ag contacts increases over time, consistent with silver oxide formation detected by TOF-SIMS depth profiles. The evolution of the work function is found to be advantageous for Ag as a hole-extracting contact, but unsuitable for electron \u2026"
