                "This review presents recent developments in the understanding of how impurities influence the electronic states in the bulk properties of superconductors. The focus is on quasilocalized states in the vicinity of impurity sites in conventional and unconventional superconductors and the goal is to provide a unified framework for their description. The nonmagnetic impurity resonances in unconventional superconductors are directly related to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states around magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave systems. The physics behind these states, including the quantum phase transition between screened and unscreened impurities, are reviewed and recent work on d-wave superconductors is emphasized. The bound states are seen in scanning-tunneling spectroscopy measurements on high-T c cuprates, which are described in detail. This paper discusses very recent progress in our understanding of \u2026",
                "We measured the specific heat and resistivity of heavy fermion C e C o I n 5 between the superconducting critical field H c 2= 5 T and 9 T, with the field in the [001] direction, and at temperatures down to 50 mK. At 5 T the data show a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior down to the lowest temperatures. At the field above 8 T the data exhibit a crossover from the Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid behavior. We analyzed the scaling properties of the specific heat and compared both the resistivity and the specific heat with the predictions of a spin-fluctuation theory. Our analysis leads us to suggest that the NFL behavior is due to incipient antiferromagnetism (AFM) in C e C o I n 5 with the quantum critical point in the vicinity of H c 2. Below H c 2 the AFM phase which competes with the paramagnetic ground state is superseded by the superconducting transition.",
                "Over the past two decades, unconventional superconductivity with gap symmetry other than s wave has been found in several classes of materials, including heavy fermion, high T c, and organic superconductors. Unconventional superconductivity is characterized by anisotropic superconducting gap functions, which may have zeros (nodes) along certain directions in the Brillouin zone. The nodal structure is closely related to the pairing interaction, and it is widely believed that the presence of nodes is a signature of magnetic or some other exotic, rather than conventional phonon mediated, pairing mechanism. Therefore experimental determination of the gap function is of fundamental importance. However, the detailed gap structure, especially the direction of the nodes, is an unresolved issue for most unconventional superconductors. Recently it has been demonstrated that thermal conductivity and specific heat \u2026",
                "We show that the density of states and the thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional d-wave superconductor in the vortex state with applied magnetic field H in the plane depend on the angle between H and the order-parameter nodes. Within a semiclassical treatment of the extended quasiparticle states, we obtain fourfold oscillations of the specific heat, measurement of which provides a simple probe of gap symmetry. The frequency dependence of the density of states and the temperature dependence of thermodynamic properties obey different power laws for field in the nodal and antinodal direction. The fourfold pattern is changed to twofold when orthorhombicity is considered.",
                "We investigate the ground state properties of a noncentrosymmetric superconductor near a surface. We determine the spectrum of Andreev bound states due to surface-induced mixing of bands with opposite spin helicities for a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. We find that the order parameter suppression qualitatively changes the bound state spectrum. The spin structure of Andreev states leads to a spin supercurrent along the interface, which is strongly enhanced compared to the normal state spin current. Particle and hole coherence amplitudes show Faraday-like rotations of the spin along quasiparticle trajectories.",
                "We consider a quasi-two-dimensional superconductor with line nodes in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, and compute the dependence of the specific heat C and the in-plane heat conductivity \u03ba on the angle between the field and the nodal direction in the vortex state. We use a variation of the microscopic Brandt-Pesch-Tewordt method that accounts for the scattering of quasiparticles off vortices, and analyze the signature of the nodes in C and \u03ba. At low to moderate fields the specific heat anisotropy changes sign with increasing temperature. Comparison with measurements of C and \u03ba in CeCoIn 5 resolves the contradiction between the two in favor of the d x 2\u2212 y 2 gap.",
                "We present the results of a microscopic calculation of the longitudinal thermal conductivity, \u03ba xx, of a d-wave superconductor in the mixed state. Our results show an increase in the thermal conductivity with the applied field at low temperatures and a decrease followed by a nearly field independent \u03ba xx (H) at higher temperatures, in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We discuss the relationship between the slope of the superconducting gap and the plateau in \u03ba xx (H).",
                "The structure of the superconducting order parameter in the iron-pnictide superconductor BaFe 2 (As 0.67 P 0.33) 2 (T c= 31 K) with line nodes is studied by the angle-resolved thermal conductivity measurements in a magnetic field rotated within the basal plane. We find that the thermal conductivity displays distinct fourfold oscillations with minima when the field is directed at\u00b145\u2218 with respect to the tetragonal a axis. We discuss possible gap structures that can account for the data, and conclude that the observed results are most consistent with the closed nodal loops located at the flat parts of the electron Fermi surface with high Fermi velocity.",
                "We have synthesized polycrystalline samples of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mo 3 Al 2 C by arc and RF melting, measured its transport, magnetic and thermodynamic properties, and computed its band structure. Experimental results indicate a bulk superconducting transition at T c\u223c 9.2 K while the density of states at the Fermi surface is found to be dominated by Mo d orbitals. Using the measured values for the lower critical field H c 1, upper critical field H c 2, and the specific heat C, we estimated the thermodynamic critical field H c (0), coherence length \u03be (0), penetration depth \u03bb (0), and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \u03ba (0). The specific-heat jump at T c, \u0394 C\/\u03b3 T c= 2.14, suggests that Mo 3 Al 2 C is moderately to strongly coupled, consistent with the fast opening of the gap, as evidenced by the rapid release of entropy below T c from our electronic specific-heat measurements.

As a result of the interactions, materials exhibit emergent collective\n                  properties: the behavior of a 1mm sample when probed in experiment is very different\n                  from the response of individual atoms that make up the material. The collective properties\n                  are a consequence of order: in simple solids it is the arrangement of atoms in a regular\n                  crystal lattice that gives rise to its rigidity and also determines whether the material\n                  is a metal or an insulator. A plethora of different, and often more exotic, orders\n                  occurs in more complicated systems: from magnetic and charge to superconductivity\n                  and the \"hidden\" order. The challenge of condensed matter physics is to understand how this fantastic complexity\n                  of behavior arises from basic quantum mechanics governing the motion of electrons,\n                  and to find an effective way to understand and describe the emergent properties. Theoretical\n                  approaches combine statistical physics (there are ~10 23 electrons per cubic centimeter in a typical solid), quantum mechanics (electrons\n                  are fermions, which means that they avoid each other when filling up energy levels,\n                  and at or below room temperature they behave as quantum-mechanical particles), and\n                  treatments of strong interactions of many particles. In my research I analyze the consequences of unusual orders on the experimentally\n                  measured quantities, use the experimental data to draw conclusions about the origin\n                  of the unconventional properties of strongly interacting electron systems, and investigate\n                  theoretical models for emergence of different types of exotic orders, their competition\n                  and coexistence. I am especially interested in the unconventional superconductivity\n                  in high-temperature copper oxide superconductors and heavy fermion materials and interplay\n                  of superconductivity and itinerant magnetism in these systems. I am also investigating\n                  the properties of materials near the Quantum Critical Points: points where a phase\n                  transition between two different ground states occurs at T=0 and and is accompanied\n                  by quantum mechanical fluctuations.
