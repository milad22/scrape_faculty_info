                "Katie Ansell Teaching Assistant Professor 255 Loomis Laboratory crimmin1@illinois.edu PER group webpage Professor Ansell received her BS in physics and music from the University of Michigan in 2008, and completed her PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2020. She works at the intersection of implementing new pedagogies in physics labs and evaluating their effects on students. While working on her PhD, she developed a new curriculum for Physics 211 labs that fosters the development of creativity and independent thinking, supported by practical and procedural experimental skills. This new curriculum has grown to include the algebra- and calculus-based Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism courses, as well as leading to the growth of a Learning Assistant program in the Physics department and improved efforts to train Teaching Assistants in pedagogy. Professor Ansell's research focuses on studying how previous experience and expectations impact students' responses to open-ended experimental situations, and how instructional design choices promote or inhibit student independence. Katie is continuing course development and research with the PER group as a Teaching Assistant Professor.
