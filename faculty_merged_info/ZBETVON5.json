                "Stephen L. Teitel Professor of Physics PhD in Physics, Cornell University, 1981 455B\u00a0Bausch & Lomb Hall (585) 275-4039 Fax: (585) 273-3237 stte@pas.rochester.edu Biography Professor Teitel received his BS in engineering physics (1975) and his PhD in physics (1981), both from Cornell University. After\u00a0postdoctoral positions at the Ohio State University (1981-83) and the Weizmann Institute of Science (1983-86), he joined the\u00a0University as Assistant Professor of Physics in 1986. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1992 and to Professor in 1999.\u00a0He was the Associate Chair of the Department from 2013-2018. \u00a0Professor Teitel was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2000. He received the department's award for Excellence\u00a0in Teaching in 2000 and 2016, a University Bridging Fellowship in 2003, and was named an Outstanding Referee of the American Physical Society in 2011. Research Overview Professor Teitel's research interests are in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics, particularly in the area of statistical\u00a0mechanics and critical phenomena. Investigations are carried out primarily through the\u00a0use of large scale numerical simulations. \u00a0Most recently his interest has focused on behavior in granular and related soft matter systems, in particular on behavior near the jamming transition where the system changes from liquid-like to solid-like behavior. \u00a0Previous work dealt with the phenomenological behavior of vortex fluctuations in\u00a0superconducting systems, such as high temperature superconductors and two dimensional arrays of Josephson\u00a0junctions. Another recent topic of investigation concerned the\u00a0structural stability and shape transformations of nanometer sized gold clusters. Professor Teitel has also worked on problems relating to relaxation in\u00a0glassy systems, the equilibrium shape of crystals, and superfluidity.
