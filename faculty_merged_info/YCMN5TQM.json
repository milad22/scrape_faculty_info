                "Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) has been developed to study transient structures in complex chemical reactions initiated with femtosecond laser pulses. This direct imaging of reactions was achieved using our third-generation apparatus equipped with an electron pulse (1.07 \u00b1 0.27 picoseconds) source, a charge-coupled device camera, and a mass spectrometer. Two prototypical gas-phase reactions were studied: the nonconcerted elimination reaction of a haloethane, wherein the structure of the intermediate was determined, and the ring opening of a cyclic hydrocarbon containing no heavy atoms. These results demonstrate the vastly improved sensitivity, resolution, and versatility of UED for studying ultrafast structural dynamics in complex molecular systems.",
                "We report direct determination of the structures and dynamics of interfacial water on a hydrophilic surface with atomic-scale resolution using ultrafast electron crystallography. On the nanometer scale, we observed the coexistence of ordered surface water and crystallite-like ice structures, evident in the superposition of Bragg spots and Debye-Scherrer rings. The structures were determined to be dominantly cubic, but each undergoes different dynamics after the ultrafast substrate temperature jump. From changes in local bond distances (OH\u00b7\u00b7O and O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) with time, we elucidated the structural changes in the far-from-equilibrium regime at short times and near-equilibration at long times.",
                "With properly timed sequences of ultrafast electron pulses, it is now possible to image complex molecular structures in the four dimensions of space and time with resolutions of 0.01\u2005\u00c5 and 1\u2005ps, respectively. The new limits of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) provide the means for the determination of transient molecular structures, including reactive intermediates and non\u2010equilibrium structures of complex energy landscapes. By freezing structures on the ultrafast timescale, we are able to develop concepts that correlate structure with dynamics. Examples include structure\u2010driven radiationless processes, dynamics\u2010driven reaction stereochemistry, pseudorotary transition\u2010state structures, and non\u2010equilibrium structures exhibiting negative temperature, bifurcation, or selective energy localization in bonds. These successes in the studies of complex molecular systems, even without heavy atoms, and the recent \u2026",
                "Using optical, TEM, and ultrafast electron diffraction experiments we find that single crystal VO 2 microbeams gently placed on insulating substrates or metal grids exhibit different behaviors, with structural and metal-insulator transitions occurring at the same temperature for insulating substrates, while for metal substrates a new monoclinic metal phase lies between the insulating monoclinic phase and the metallic rutile phase. The structural and electronic phase transitions in these experiments are strongly first order and we discuss their origins in the context of current understanding of multiorbital splitting, strong correlation effects, and structural distortions that act cooperatively in this system.",
                "We use ultrafast electron crystallography to study structural changes induced in graphite by a femtosecond laser pulse. At moderate fluences of\u2264 21 mJ\/cm 2, lattice vibrations are observed to thermalize on a time scale of\u2248 8 ps. At higher fluences approaching the damage threshold, lattice vibration amplitudes saturate. Following a marked initial contraction, graphite is driven nonthermally into a transient state with s p 3-like character, forming interlayer bonds. Using ab initio density functional calculations, we trace the governing mechanism back to electronic structure changes following the photoexcitation.",
                "The static structure of macromolecular assemblies can be mapped out with atomic-scale resolution by using electron diffraction and microscopy of crystals. For transient nonequilibrium structures, which are critical to the understanding of dynamics and mechanisms, both spatial and temporal resolutions are required; the shortest scales of length (0.1\u20131 nm) and time (10\u201313 to 10\u201312 s) represent the quantum limit, the nonstatistical regime of rates. Here, we report the development of ultrafast electron crystallography for direct determination of structures with submonolayer sensitivity. In these experiments, we use crystalline silicon as a template for different adsorbates: hydrogen, chlorine, and trifluoroiodomethane. We observe the coherent restructuring of the surface layers with subangstrom displacement of atoms after the ultrafast heat impulse. This nonequilibrium dynamics, which is monitored in steps of 2 ps (total \u2026",
                "We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography on size-selected Au nanoparticles (2\u221220 nm) supported on a molecular interface. Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with subpicosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting, the nanoparticles are driven to a nonequilibrium transformation, characterized by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron\u2212phonon coupling, and, upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal\/liquid coexistence during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization, where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree of structural change \u2026",
                "Studies of molecular structures at or near their equilibrium configurations have long provided information on their geometry in terms of bond distances and angles. Far-from-equilibrium structures are relatively unknown\u2014especially for complex systems\u2014and generally, neither their dynamics nor their average geometries can be extrapolated from equilibrium values. For such nonequilibrium structures, vibrational amplitudes and bond distances play a central role in phenomena such as energy redistribution and chemical reactivity. Ultrafast electron diffraction, which was developed to study transient molecular structures, provides a direct method for probing the nature of complex molecules far from equilibrium. Here we present our ultrafast electron diffraction observations of transient structures for two cyclic hydrocarbons. At high internal energies of \u22484 eV, these molecules display markedly different behavior. For 1,3,5 \u2026",
                "We review the development of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography as a method for investigating structural dynamics for nanoscale materials and interfaces. Its sensitivity and resolution are demonstrated in the studies of surface melting of gold nanocrystals, nonequilibrium transformation of graphite into reversible diamond-like intermediates, and molecular scale charge dynamics, showing a versatility for not only determining the structures, but also the charge and energy redistribution at interfaces. A quantitative scheme for three-dimensional retrieval of atomic structures is demonstrated with few-particle (< 1000) sensitivity, establishing this nanocrystallographic method as a tool for directly visualizing dynamics within isolated nanomaterials with atomic scale spatio-temporal resolution.",
                "Characterizing and understanding the emergence of multiple macroscopically ordered electronic phases through subtle tuning of temperature, pressure, and chemical doping has been a long-standing central issue for complex materials research. We report the first comprehensive studies of optical doping\u2013induced emergence of stable phases and metastable hidden phases visualized in situ by femtosecond electron crystallography. The electronic phase transitions are triggered by femtosecond infrared pulses, and a temperature\u2013optical density phase diagram is constructed and substantiated with the dynamics of metastable states, highlighting the cooperation and competition through which the macroscopic quantum orders emerge. These results elucidate key pathways of femtosecond electronic switching phenomena and provide an important new avenue to comprehensively investigate optical doping\u2013induced \u2026"

Dynamics of size-selected gold nanoparticles studied by ultrafast electron nanocrystallography (Nano Lett. 7, 1290 (2007)). Our research team is among a handful of groups in the world actively developing ultrafast electron diffraction and imaging technologies for studying materials and molecular processes in the ultrafast time scale and with atomic scale resolution. In many ways complementary to the uses of X-rays, obtained from the powerful synchrotron and in the future hard-X-ray free electron lasers facilities, the electron technology is advantageous in nondestructive investigation of nanomaterials and interfaces due to its strong scattering with atomic nuclei. In the past few years, our researches have been directed in understanding the photophysical and photochemical processes in nanomaterials, including: searches for optical route of graphite-to-diamond transformation, and investigating plasmonic effects in nanoparticles, phase transitions of small particles, and the cooperative phenomena of charge density waves. We recently discovered that by properly analyzing the pulsed electron scattering pattern, the ultrafast electron diffraction is sensitive to the crystal potential changes and charge ordering, thus offering new ways to investigate collective electronic processes. Efforts have been made to understand the laser induced hot electron dynamics and photoemission from various functional materials, and strongly correlated materials exhibiting optical switching. Beyond investigating the fundamental physics, mechanistic understanding of the elemental processes in light-induced phase transition and energy transport in nanoscale materials and interfaces are important to implement an array of applications in optoelectronics, such as memory, nanoelectronics technologies, and clean energy sciences, such as photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. These research efforts are intimately coupled with continuing development of methods to provide the necessary resolutions and throughput to resolve the critical sciences. Currently, the team members are developing an environmental cell for solution phase ultrafast diffraction, robust methods for dynamical diffraction analyses, and, through collaborating with experts in laser, electron microscope, and accelerator\/beam sciences, constructing a new generation of high-brightness ultrafast diffraction camera."
