                "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a major cause of neurological disease following the near eradication of poliovirus. Accumulating evidence suggests that mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs of 18 to 23 nucleotides (nt) with important regulatory roles in many cellular processes, participate in host antiviral defenses. However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 infection and pathogenesis are still unclear. Here, hsa-miR-296-5p expression was significantly increased in EV71-infected human cells. As determined by virus titration, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting, overexpression of hsa-miR-296-5p inhibited, while inhibition of endogenous hsa-miR-296-5p facilitated, EV71 infection. Additionally, two potential hsa-miR-296-5p targets (nt 2115 to 2135 and nt 2896 to 2920) located in the EV71 genome (strain BrCr) were bioinformatically predicted and validated by \u2026",
                "Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a single, positive-stranded RNA virus, has been regarded as the most important neurotropic enterovirus after the eradication of the poliovirus. EV71 infection can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina. Cytokine storm with elevated levels of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, has been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of EV71-induced disease. TNF-\u03b1\u2013mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays a key role in inflammatory response. We hypothesized that EV71 might also moderate host inflammation by interfering with this pathway. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and identified EV71 2C protein as an antagonist of TNF-\u03b1\u2013mediated activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Expression of 2C protein significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1\u2013mediated NF-\u03baB activation in 293T cells as measured by gene reporter and gel mobility shift assays. Furthermore \u2026",
                "Human bocavirus (HBoV) mainly infects young children. Although many infected children suffer from respiratory or gastroenteric tract diseases, an association between HBoV and these diseases is not definite. Because modulation of type I IFN is crucial for viruses to establish efficient replication, in this study, we tested whether HBoV modulates type I IFN production. We observed that a nearly full-length HBoV clone significantly reduced both Sendai virus (SeV)- and poly(deoxyadenylic-thymidylic) acid-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Further study showed that NP1 blocked IFN-\u03b2 activation in response to SeV, poly(deoxyadenylic-thymidylic) acid, and IFN-\u03b2 pathway inducers, including retinoic acid-inducible protein I, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, inhibitor of \u03baB kinase \u03b5, and TANK-binding kinase 1. In addition, NP1 interfered with IRF-3\u2013responsive PRD(III-I) promoter activated by SeV and a constitutively active \u2026",
                "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and D virus (HDV) co-infections cause the most severe form of viral hepatitis. HDV induces an innate immune response, but it is unknown how the host cell senses HDV and if this defense affects HDV replication. We aim to characterize interferon (IFN) activation by HDV, identify the responsible sensor and evaluate the effect of IFN on HDV replication.HDV and HBV susceptible hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were used for infection studies. Viral markers and cellular gene expression were analyzed at different time points after infection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) required for HDV-mediated IFN activation and the impact on HDV replication were studied using stable knock-down or overexpression of the PRRs.Microarray analysis revealed that HDV but not HBV infection activated a broad range of interferon stimulated \u2026",
                "Labeling of virus opens new pathways for the understanding of viruses themselves and facilitates the utilization of viruses in modern biology, medicine, and materials. Based on the characteristic that viruses hijack their host cellular machineries to survive and reproduce themselves, a host-cell-assisted strategy is proposed to label enveloped viruses. By simply feeding Vero cells with commercial 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl) (sodium salt) (Biotin-Cap-PE), we obtained biotinylated Vero cells whose membrane systems were modified with biotin. Subsequently, pseudorabies viruses (PrV) were cultivated in the biotinylated Vero cells, and the PrV progenies were spontaneously labeled with Biotin-Cap-PE during viral natural assembly process. Since the viral natural assembly process was employed for the labeling, potential threats of genetic engineering and difficulties in keeping viral \u2026",
                "Single-virus labeling and tracking represent a powerful tool to study virus\u2013cell interactions. Using baculovirus as a model, here we developed a biochemical method for labeling both the viral envelope and the viral capsid of a virus. Viral envelope of the baculovirus AcMNPV was self-biotinylated and site-specifically conjugated with quantum dots (QDs) following one-step binding reaction, while the viral nucleocapsid was site-specifically labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) during viral replication. The established procedure of labeling did not affect viral infectivity, showing that the double-labeled virus retained functional structure and could be tracked for viral localization and movement in the host cells. The double-labeled virus also demonstrated the potential to be used for in-situ and real-time visualizing the internalization of a single viral particle into the host cells. Furthermore, the disassembly processes of \u2026",
                "Highly efficient labeling of viruses with quantum dots (QDs) is the prerequisite for the long-term tracking of virus invasion at the single virus level to reveal mechanisms of virus infection. As one of the structural components of viruses, viral envelope lipids are hard to be labeled with QDs due to the lack of efficient methods to modify viral envelope lipids. Moreover, it is still a challenge to maintain the intactness and infectivity of labeled viruses. Herein, a mild method has been developed to label viral envelope lipids with QDs by harnessing the biotinylated lipid-self-inserted cellular membrane. Biotinylated lipids can spontaneously insert in cellular membranes of host cells during culture and then be naturally assembled on progeny Pseudorabies virus (PrV) via propagation. The biotinylated PrV can be labeled with streptavidin-conjugated QDs, with a labeling efficiency of \u223c90%. Such a strategy to label lipids with QDs \u2026",
                "The NF-\u03baB signaling network, which is an ancient signaling pathway, plays a pivotal role in innate immunity and constitutes a first line of defense against invading pathogens, including viruses. However, numerous viruses possess evolved strategies to antagonize the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our previous study demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 2C of enterovirus 71 (EV71), which is the major pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease, inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB by suppressing I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) phosphorylation. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the inhibition of IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation by EV71 2C remains largely elusive. We demonstrate that EV71 2C interacts with all isoforms of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalytic subunit (the PP1\u03b1, PP1\u03b2, and PP1\u03b3 isoforms) through PP1-docking motifs. EV71 2C has no influence on the \u2026",
                "Dual\u2010color virus particles were obtained by labeling a glycoprotein (GP64) on the surface of a baculovirus with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and labeling the nucleic acid (dsDNA) at the same time with the red fluorescent [Ru (phen) 2 (dppz)] 2+ complex during the viral replication in host cells, by using an in vivo virus self\u2010assembly system. This labeling strategy does not affect the viral infectivity.",
                "HSV-2 is the major cause of genital herpes, and its infection increases the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission. After initial infection, HSV-2 can establish latency within the nervous system and thus maintains lifelong infection in humans. It has been suggested that HSV-2 can inhibit type I IFN signaling, but the underlying mechanism has yet to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate that productive HSV-2 infection suppresses Sendai virus (SeV) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. We further reveal that US1, an immediate-early protein of HSV-2, contributes to such suppression, showing that US1 inhibits IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity and IFN-\u03b2 production at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas US1 knockout significantly impairs such capability in the context of HSV-2 infection. US1 directly interacts with DNA binding domain of IRF-3, and such interaction suppresses the association of \u2026"
