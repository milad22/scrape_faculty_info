                "Using atomic resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we present here the experimental evidence of a silicene sheet (graphenelike structure) epitaxially grown on a close-packed silver surface [Ag(111)]. This has been achieved via direct condensation of a silicon atomic flux onto the single-crystal substrate in ultrahigh vacuum conditions. A highly ordered silicon structure, arranged within a honeycomb lattice, is synthesized and present two silicon sublattices occupying positions at different heights (0.02 nm) indicating possible sp2-sp3 hybridizations.",
                "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were used to study the self-aligned silicon nanoribbons on Ag(110) with honeycomb, graphene-like structure. The silicon honeycombs structure on top of the silver substrate is clearly observed by STM, while the DFT calculations confirm that the Si atoms adopt spontaneously this new silicon structure.",
                "Silicene\u2013the silicon-based counterpart of graphene\u2013has a two dimensional structure that is responsible for the variety of potentially useful chemical and physical properties. The existence of silicene has been achieved recently owing to experiments involving epitaxial growth of silicon as stripes on Ag(001), ribbons on Ag(110), and sheets on Ag(111). The nano-ribbons observed on Ag(110) were found\u2013by both high definition experimental scanning tunneling microscopy images and density functional theory calculations\u2013to consist of an arched honeycomb structure. Angle resolved photo-emission experiments on these silicene nano-ribbons on Ag(110), along the direction of the ribbons, showed a band structure which is analogous to the Dirac cones of graphene. Unlike silicon surfaces, which are highly reactive to oxygen, the silicene nano-ribbons were found to be resistant to oxygen reactivity.On the theoretical \u2026",
                "We report on the electronic properties of straight, 1.6 nm wide, silicene nanoribbons on Ag(110), arranged in a one-dimensional grating with a pitch of 2 nm, whose high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy images reveal a honeycomb geometry. Angle-resolved photoemission shows quantum confined electronic states of one-dimensional character. The silicon band dispersion along the direction of the nanoribbons suggests a behavior analogous to the Dirac cones of graphene on different substrates.",
                "Our calculated vibrational properties of Ag nanocrystals show three novel, size dependent features which have broad implications for their thermodynamic properties and stability. There is an enhancement in the vibrational density of states at low frequencies and an overall shift of the high frequency band beyond the top of the bulk phonons. Additionally, the vibrational projected density of states of the surface atoms scales linearly with frequency, at low frequencies. The generality of these results for systems with bond-order\u2013bond-length correlation, low average coordination, and large ratio of surface to bulk atoms helps explain qualitatively several recent experimental observations.",
                "The dependence of diffraction peak intensities upon temperature for the scattering of helium from various copper surfaces: Cu (111), (100), (110), (113), (115) and (117), has been experimentally determined for two incident energies (21\u201363 meV) and a large range of incidence angles. For the close-packed faces (111) and (100), the data are consistent with a Debye-Waller formalism involving an effective surface mean square displacement <u2eff>. The quantitative fit with the data is good if anharmonic effects are properly taken into account. This result establishes that a generalized Debye-Waller formalism is, at least as a first approximation, relevant to the helium-surface diffraction. For the rougher surfaces the agreement remains good up to a threshold temperature above which the intensities are always lower than predicted by the model. It is proposed that this may be due to some kind of thermal roughening of the \u2026",
                "In this paper we report on several structures of silicene, the analog of graphene for silicon, on the silver surfaces Ag (100), Ag (110) and Ag (111). Deposition of Si produces honeycomb structures on these surfaces. In particular, we present an extensive theoretical study of silicene on Ag (111) for which several recent experimental studies have been published. Different silicene structures were obtained only by varying the silicon coverage and\/or its atomic arrangement. All the structures studied show that silicene is buckled, with a Si\u2013Si nearest neighbor distance varying between 2.28 and 2.5 \u00c5. Due to the buckling in the silicene sheet, the apparent (lateral) Si\u2013Si distance can be as low as 1.89 \u00c5. We also found that for a given coverage and symmetry, one may observe different scanning tunneling microscopy images corresponding to structures that differ by only a translation.",
                "We review our recent discovery of silicene in the form of silicon nano-ribbons epitaxially grown on silver (1 1 0) or (1 0 0) surfaces, which paves the way for the growth of graphene-like sheets. We further draw some perspectives for this unique novel material upon mild hydrogenation.",
                "Silicene, a monolayer of silicon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, is the challenging hypothetical reflection in the silicon realm of graphene, a one-atom thick graphite sheet, presently the hottest material in condensed matter physics. If existing, it would also reveal a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications. Here, we reveal the epitaxial growth of silicene stripes self-aligned in a massively parallel array on the anisotropic silver (110) surface. This crucial step in the silicene \u201cgold rush\u201d could give a new kick to silicon on the electronics road-map and open the most promising route towards wide-ranging applications. A hint of superconductivity in these silicene stripes poses intriguing questions related to the delicate interplay between paired correlated fermions, massless Dirac fermions and bosonic quasiparticles in low dimensions.",
                "Silicene is emerging as a two-dimensional material with very attractive electronic properties for a wide range of applications; it is a particularly promising material for nano-electronics in silicon-based technology. Over the last decade, the existence and stability of silicene has been the subject of much debate. Theoretical studies were the first to predict a puckered honeycomb structure with electronic properties resembling those of graphene. Though these studies were for free-standing silicene, experimental fabrication of silicene has been achieved so far only through epitaxial growth on crystalline surfaces. Indeed, it was only in 2010 that researchers presented the first experimental evidence of the formation of silicene on Ag(1 1 0) and Ag(1 1 1), which has launched silicene in a similar way to graphene. This very active field has naturally led to the recent growth of silicene on Ir(1 1 1), ZrB2(0 0 0 1) and Au(1 1 0 \u2026"
