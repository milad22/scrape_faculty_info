                "A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb\u2212 1 collected at s= 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb\u2212 1 at s= 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113, H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H\u2192 W W (\u204e)\u2192 e \u03bd \u03bc \u03bd in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e), W W (\u204e), b b\u00af and \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212 in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113 and H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7\u00d7 10\u2212 9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model \u2026",
                "The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid. This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers. All of these components come together under the ATLAS simulation infrastructure. In this paper, that infrastructure is discussed, including that supporting the detector description, interfacing the event generation, and combining the GEANT4 simulation of the response of the individual detectors. Also described are the tools allowing the software validation, performance testing, and the validation of the simulated output against known physics processes.",
                "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",
                "The luminosity determination for the ATLAS detector at the LHC during pp collisions at s\u221a= 8 TeV in 2012 is presented. The evaluation of the luminosity scale is performed using several luminometers, and comparisons between these luminosity detectors are made to assess the accuracy, consistency and long-term stability of the results. A luminosity uncertainty of \u03b4\u2112\/\u2112 = \u00b11.9% is obtained for the 22.7 fb-1 of pp collision data delivered to ATLAS at s\u221a= 8 TeV in 2012.",
                "During 2015 the ATLAS experiment recorded  of proton\u2013proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of . The ATLAS trigger system is a crucial component of the experiment, responsible for selecting events of interest at a recording rate of approximately 1 kHz from up to 40 MHz of collisions. This paper presents a short overview of the changes to the trigger and data acquisition systems during the first long shutdown of the LHC and shows the performance of the trigger system and its components based on the 2015 proton\u2013proton collision data.",
                "Detailed measurements of the electron performance of the ATLAS detector at the LHC are reported, using decays of the Z, W and J\/\u03c8 particles. Data collected in 2010 at\\(\\sqrt {s}= 7\\mbox {~ TeV}\\) are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of almost 40 pb\u2212 1. The inter-alignment of the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter, the determination of the electron energy scale and resolution, and the performance in terms of response uniformity and linearity are discussed. The electron identification, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies, as well as the charge misidentification probability, are also presented.",
                "A detailed study is presented of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector. The reconstruction of tracks, leptons, photons, missing energy and jets is investigated, together with the performance of b-tagging and the trigger. The physics potential for a variety of interesting physics processes, within the Standard Model and beyond, is examined. The study comprises a series of notes based on simulations of the detector and physics processes, with particular emphasis given to the data expected from the first years of operation of the LHC at CERN.",
                "The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of s\u221a=7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb\u22121. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta p T\u226520 GeV and pseudorapidities |\u03b7|<4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region (|\u03b7|<0.8) for jets with 60\u2264p T<800 GeV, and is maximally 14 % for p T<30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2\u2264|\u03b7|<4.5. The jet energy is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon p T, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-p T jets recoiling against a high-p T jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, aiming for an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The systematic uncertainty of the jet energy determined from a combination of in situ techniques is \u2026",
                "Studies of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the Higgs boson are presented, based on proton\u2013proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The Standard Model spin\u2013parity J P= 0+ hypothesis is compared with alternative hypotheses using the Higgs boson decays H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3, H\u2192 Z Z\u204e\u2192 4 \u2113 and H\u2192 W W\u204e\u2192 \u2113 \u03bd \u2113 \u03bd, as well as the combination of these channels. The analysed dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb\u2212 1 collected at a centre-of-mass energy of s= 8 TeV. For the H\u2192 Z Z\u204e\u2192 4 \u2113 decay mode the dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb\u2212 1 collected at s= 7 TeV is included. The data are compatible with the Standard Model J P= 0+ quantum numbers for the Higgs boson, whereas all alternative hypotheses studied in this Letter, namely some specific J P= 0\u2212, 1+, 1\u2212, 2+ models, are excluded at confidence levels above 97.8%. This exclusion holds \u2026"

She then attended the California Institute of Technology and obtained her Ph.D. in Physics in 2011. She then worked at CERN as a Research Fellow and Research Staff Scientist from 2011-2017 before moving to LBNL as a Divisional Fellow in 2017. Heather joined the UC Berkeley faculty as assistant professor in 2019. She received the IUPAP C11 Young Scientist Prize in 2018. I am an experimental particle physicist working on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) just outside Geneva in Switzerland. I have broad interests in particle physics, but the primary focus of my research is the Higgs boson -- the most recently discovered elementary particle, the only known elementary scalar of nature and the final piece of the remarkably successful Standard Model. However, this discovery leaves many imporatnt questions unanswered and uncovers further questions. The Higgs is not just another particle. It is profoundly different from all other elementary particles, relates to the most obscure sectors of the Standard Model and is linked to some of the deep questions, so it might prove to be a portal to find new physics. I study the properties of the Higgs boson and, in particular, how it interacts with different types of quarks, including top, bottom and charm quarks.\u00a0 Other research interests include the development of track reconstruction algorithms, silicon detectors and algorithms for quantum computers. A theme throughout my research is applications of machine learning. I collaborate with Professors Marjorie Shapiro and Haicheln Wang at UC Berkeley and with scientists in the ATLAS group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The ATLAS group at LBNL works on a broad range of physics topics from measurements to the Standard Model to searches for new physics. The group also plays important roles in the operation of the ATLAS pixel detectors, design and construction of upgraded silicon detectors, software development for improved detector performance, event generation, simulation, and computing.
