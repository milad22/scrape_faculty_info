                "The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a new observatory for very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays. CTA has ambitions science goals, for which it is necessary to achieve full-sky coverage, to improve the sensitivity by about an order of magnitude, to span about four decades of energy, from a few tens of GeV to above 100 TeV with enhanced angular and energy resolutions over existing VHE gamma-ray observatories. An international collaboration has formed with more than 1000 members from 27 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America. In 2010 the CTA Consortium completed a Design Study and started a three-year Preparatory Phase which leads to production readiness of CTA in 2014. In this paper we introduce the science goals and the concept of CTA, and provide an overview of the project.",
                " Following the detection of strong TeV \u03b3\u2010ray flares from the BL Lac object 1ES 1959+650 with the Whipple 10 m Cerenkov telescope on 2002 May 16 and 17, we performed intensive target of opportunity radio, optical, X\u2010ray, and TeV \u03b3\u2010ray observations from 2002 May 18 to August 14. Observations with the X\u2010ray telescope Rossi X\u2010Ray Timing Explorer and the Whipple and HEGRA \u03b3\u2010ray telescopes revealed several strong flares, enabling us to sensitively test the X\u2010ray\u2013\u03b3\u2010ray flux correlation properties. Although the X\u2010ray and \u03b3\u2010ray fluxes seemed to be correlated in general, we found an \u201corphan\u201d \u03b3\u2010ray flare that was not accompanied by an X\u2010ray flare. While we detected optical flux variability with the Boltwood and Abastumani observatories, the data did not give evidence for a correlation of the optical flux variability with the observed X\u2010ray and \u03b3\u2010ray flares.

                "In this Letter we report the discovery of TeV gamma-ray emission from a supernova remnant made with the CANGAROO 3.8 m telescope. TeV gamma rays were detected at the sky position and extension coincident with the northeast rim of shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006 (Type Ia). SN 1006 has been a most likely candidate for an extended TeV gamma-ray source, since the clear synchrotron X-ray emission from the rims was recently observed by ASCA (Koyama et al.), which is strong evidence for the existence of very high energy (up to hundreds of TeV) electrons in the SNR. The observed TeV gamma-ray flux was (2.4\u00b10.5 [statistical]\u00b10.7 [systematic])\u00d7 10\u2212 12 cm-2 s-1 (\u2265 3.0\u00b10.9 TeV) and (4.6\u00b10.6\u00b11.4)\u00d7 10\u2212 12 cm-2 s-1 (\u2265 1.7\u00b10.5 TeV) from the 1996 and 1997 observations, respectively. Also, we set an upper limit on the TeV gamma-ray emission from the southwest rim, which is estimated to be 1.1 \u2026",

                "The first atmospheric Cherenkov telescope of VERITAS (the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) has been in operation since February 2005. We present here a technical description of the instrument and a summary of its performance. The calibration methods are described, along with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the telescope and comparisons between real and simulated data. The analysis of TeV \u03b3-ray observations of the Crab Nebula, including the reconstructed energy spectrum, is shown to give results consistent with earlier measurements. The telescope is operating as expected and has met or exceeded all design specifications."
