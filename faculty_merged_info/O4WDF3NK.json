                "We report the confinement and cooling of an optically dense cloud of neutral sodium atoms by radiation pressure. The trapping and damping forces were provided by three retroreflected laser beams propagating along orthogonal axes, with a weak magnetic field used to distinguish between the beams. We have trapped as many as 10 7 atoms for 2 min at densities exceeding 10 11 atoms cm\u2212 3. The trap was\u2243 0.4 K deep and the atoms, once trapped, were cooled to less than a millikelvin and compacted into a region less than 0.5 mm in diameter.",
                "Complex, optically functional surfaces in organic polymers can be fabricated by replicating relief structures present on the surface of an elastomeric master with an ultraviolet or thermally curable organic polymer, while the master is deformed by compression, bending, or stretching. The versatility of this procedure for fabricating surfaces with complex, micrometer- and submicrometer-scale patterns was demonstrated by the production of (i) diffraction gratings with periods smaller than the original grating; (ii) chirped, blazed diffraction gratings (where the period of a chirped grating changes continuously with position) on planar and curved surfaces; (iii) patterned microfeatures on the surfaces of approximately hemispherical objects (for example, an optical surface similar to a fly9s eye); and (iv) arrays of rhombic microlenses. These topologically complex, micropatterned surfaces are difficult to fabricate with other \u2026",
                "We show that light can be used as a lens to focus a collimated neutral atomic beam to submicron dimensions during deposition onto a substrate. We have used an optical standing wave at 589 nm as an array of cylindrical lenses to focus a perpendicular sodium beam into a grating on a substrate, with a periodicity of 294.3\u00b10.3 nm. This result is the first direct evidence of submicron focusing of atoms by light, and represents a fundamentally new scheme for submicron lithography.",
                "An atom Michelson interferometer is implemented on an \u201catom chip.\u201d The chip uses lithographically patterned conductors and external magnetic fields to produce and guide a Bose-Einstein condensate. Splitting, reflecting, and recombining of condensate atoms are achieved by a standing-wave light field having a wave vector aligned along the atom waveguide. A differential phase shift between the two arms of the interferometer is introduced by either a magnetic-field gradient or with an initial condensate velocity. Interference contrast is still observable at 20% with an atom propagation time of 10 ms."
