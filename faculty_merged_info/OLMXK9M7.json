We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries.We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories (<18\u00b75 kg\/m2 [underweight], 18\u00b75 kg\/m2 to <20 kg\/m2, 20 kg\/m2 to <25 kg\/m2, 25 kg\/m2 to <30 kg\/m2, 30 kg\/m2 to <35 kg\/m2, 35 kg\/m2 to <40 kg\/m2, \u226540 kg\/m2 [morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions.

Our aim was to estimate worldwide trends in mean body-mass index (BMI) and a comprehensive set of BMI categories that cover underweight to obesity in children and adolescents, and to compare trends with those of adults.We pooled 2416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 128\u00b79 million participants aged 5 years and older, including 31\u00b75 million aged 5\u201319 years.

                "Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.We \u2026",
                "Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, and higher education and earnings. We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5\u201322.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3\u201319.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8\u2013144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.13410.001",
                "Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities 1, 2. This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity 3\u20136. Here we use 2,009 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017\u2014and more than 80% in some low-and middle-income regions\u2014was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low-and \u2026",
                "Embora testes de uma repeti\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima (1-RM) sejam freq\u00fcentemente utilizados para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da for\u00e7a muscular, acredita-se que os resultados obtidos possam ser afetados pela falta de familiariza\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via, at\u00e9 mesmo em sujeitos com experi\u00eancia em exerc\u00edcios com pesos. Assim, o objetivo deste estudo foi investigar o impacto do processo de familiariza\u00e7\u00e3o para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da for\u00e7a muscular em testes de 1-RM. Para tanto, 21 homens (24, 5\u00b13, 8 anos), aparentemente saud\u00e1veis, com experi\u00eancia pr\u00e9via de pelo menos seis meses em treinamento com pesos, foram submetidos a testes repetitivos de 1-RM nos exerc\u00edcios supino em banco horizontal, agachamento e rosca direta de b\u00edceps. Os testes foram executados em quatro sess\u00f5es, intervaladas a cada 48-72 horas. Um n\u00famero m\u00e1ximo de tr\u00eas tentativas, com intervalo de tr\u00eas a cinco minutos para recupera\u00e7\u00e3o, foi utilizado em cada exerc\u00edcio, nas quatro sess\u00f5es de testagem. ANOVA para medidas repetidas, seguida pelo teste post hoc de Tukey, quando p< 0, 05, foi utilizada para o tratamento dos dados. Aumentos significantes na for\u00e7a muscular (p< 0, 01) foram encontrados nos tr\u00eas exerc\u00edcios analisados entre a primeira e a quarta sess\u00e3o de familiariza\u00e7\u00e3o (2, 4% no supino em banco horizontal, 3, 4% no agachamento e 5, 4% na rosca direta de b\u00edceps). Todavia, nenhuma diferen\u00e7a estatisticamente significante foi encontrada entre a segunda e a quarta sess\u00e3o de familiariza\u00e7\u00e3o na rosca direta de b\u00edceps (p> 0, 05), bem como entre a terceira e a quarta sess\u00e3o no supino em banco horizontal e no agachamento (p> 0, 05).

                "Concurrent training is recommended for health improvement, but its acute effects on cardiovascular function are not well established. This study analyzed hemodynamics and autonomic modulation after a single session of aerobic (A), resistance (R), and concurrent (A + R) exercises. Twenty healthy subjects randomly underwent four sessions: control (C:30 min of rest), aerobic (A:30 min, cycle ergometer, 75% of VO2 peak), resistance (R:6 exercises, 3 sets, 20 repetitions, 50% of 1 RM), and concurrent (AR: A + R). Before and after the interventions, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and HR variability were measured. Systolic BP decreased after all the exercises, and the greatest decreases were observed after the A and AR sessions (\u221213 \u00b1 1 and \u221211 \u00b1 1 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.05). Diastolic BP decreased similarly after all the exercises, and this decrease lasted longer after the A \u2026",
                "Background: Due to the existing controversies in literature about the potential benefits of resistance exercise training (RT) on arterial blood pressure (BP) at rest, and the lack of studies conducted with elderly hypertensive individuals, RT is seldom recommended as a non-pharmacological treatment for arterial hypertension.Objective: To verify the effect of progressive RT on BP, HR, and RPP in elderly women with controlled hypertension.Methods: 20 elderly women (66.8\u00b15.6 years of age), with a sedentary lifestyle, monitored with anti-hypertensive medication, participated in a 12-week RT program (resistance training group-RTG). Twenty-six elderly women (65.3\u00b13.4 years of age) with controlled hypertension did not engage in physical exercise during the study period, and composed the control group.Results: After RT, there was a significant reduction in SBP, MBP, and DP values at rest. No significant drops in DBP and HR values at rest were observed after RT in both groups. The reduction in the RTG was 10.5 mmHg, 6.2 mmHg, and 2218.6 mmHg x bpm for SBP, MBP, and RPP, respectively.Conclusion: Progressive RT reduced SBP, MBP, and RPP values at rest of hypertensive elderly women who were on antihypertensive treatment.(Arq Bras Cardiol 2008; 91 (5): 274-279)",

J Strength Cond Res 25 (5): 1418-1422, 2011-The 1-repetition maximum test (1RM) has been widely used to assess maximal strength. However, to improve accuracy in assessing maximal strength, several sessions of the 1RM test are recommended. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of previous resistance training experience on the reliability of 1RM test. Thirty men were assigned to the following 2 groups according to their previous resistance training experience: no previous resistance training experience (NOEXP) and more than 24 months of resistance training experience (EXP). All subjects performed the 1RM tests in bench press and squat in 4 sessions on distinct days. There was a significant session\u00d7 group effect in bench press (F= 3.09 \u2026",
