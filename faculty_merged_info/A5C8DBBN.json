                "David Jasnow Professor Emeritus 216 Allen Hall (412) 624-9029 jasnow@pitt.edu My background is in theoretical statistical physics, in which I have gained considerable experience in phase transitions, pattern formation and kinetics and growth phenomena in condensed matter systems. Some recent work in that area focused on kinetics, growth and ordering in complex fluids, microfluidics and self\u2013repairing systems.\u00a0 I have begun a program of research in theoretical biological physics and have done work on DNA packaging kinetics, structure and energetics of condensed DNA, and bio\u2013mimetic behavior, such as the engulfing of a particle. Currently I have a collaborative program with a colleague in the Department of Computational Biology, and we have studied the statistics of rare transition events and developed sampling methods particularly applicable to the study of transitions involving conformational changes. I also have been working on the dynamics of plastic neural networks and nuclear pore transport. I am generally interested in bringing the well\u2013developed toolbox of condensed matter theory, with its focus on self\u2013assembly, order and correlation, to the biological arena.
