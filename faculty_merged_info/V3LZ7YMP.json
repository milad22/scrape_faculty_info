                "The structure of the control network of transnational corporations affects global market competition and financial stability. So far, only small national samples were studied and there was no appropriate methodology to assess control globally. We present the first investigation of the architecture of the international ownership network, along with the computation of the control held by each global player. We find that transnational corporations form a giant bow-tie structure and that a large portion of control flows to a small tightly-knit core of financial institutions. This core can be seen as an economic \u201csuper-entity\u201d that raises new important issues both for researchers and policy makers.",
                "We present a methodology to extract the backbone of complex networks based on the weight and direction of links, as well as on nontopological properties of nodes. We show how the methodology can be applied in general to networks in which mass or energy is flowing along the links. In particular, the procedure enables us to address important questions in economics, namely, how control and wealth are structured and concentrated across national markets. We report on the first cross-country investigation of ownership networks, focusing on the stock markets of 48 countries around the world. On the one hand, our analysis confirms results expected on the basis of the literature on corporate control, namely, that in Anglo-Saxon countries control tends to be dispersed among numerous shareholders. On the other hand, it also reveals that in the same countries, control is found to be highly concentrated at the global \u2026",
                "We have discovered 12 independent new empirical scaling laws in foreign exchange data series that hold for close to three orders of magnitude and across 13 currency exchange rates. Our statistical analysis crucially depends on an event-based approach that measures the relationship between different types of events. The scaling laws give an accurate estimation of the length of the price-curve coastline, which turns out to be surprisingly long. The new laws substantially extend the catalogue of stylized facts and sharply constrain the space of possible theoretical explanations of the market mechanisms."

In the standard model of particle physics, this flavor structure is connected to another fundamental question, the origin of mass, through the Yukawa couplings of the fermions to the Higgs field. In recent years, the success of the standard model in describing a wide variety of flavor-changing processes has led to stringent constraints on the structure of possible extensions of the standard model, and possible explanations for the masses of the fundamental particles. These constraints play an important role in elucidating the nature of the discoveries anticipated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. I am currently engaged in the search for the Higgs boson in its decay to two b quarks using the CMS detector at the LHC.\u00a0 This is one of the most challenging Higgs decay modes to observe at the LHC, and was originally thought to be out of reach.\u00a0 In 2010 our group demonstrated its viability at CMS using simulated events, and we recently performed the first search for the Higgs in this decay channel at CMS using proton-proton collision data recorded in 2011 [1].\u00a0 As part of the preparatory work for this search, we performed the first measurement of exclusive B production at the LHC [3]. Prior to joining CMS, for more than a decade our group played a leading role in elucidating the flavor structure of the quark sector through the study of CP violation using the BaBar detector at SLAC, including the first measurement of CP asymmetries in decays mediated by the b -> d flavor-changing neutral-current transition [5], and the discovery of direct CP violation in the B-meson system [4, 7].\u00a0 We are continuing this research through our involvement in the Super B project in Italy.
