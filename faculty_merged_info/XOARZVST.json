                "We report Curie temperatures up to 150 K in annealed Ga1\u2212xMnxAs epilayers grown with a relatively low As:Ga beam equivalent pressure ratio. A variety of measurements (magnetization, Hall effect, magnetic circular dichroism and Raman scattering) suggest that the higher Curie temperature results from an enhanced free hole density. The data also indicate that, in addition to the carrier concentration, the sample thickness limits the maximum attainable Curie temperature in this material, suggesting that the free surface of Ga1\u2212xMnxAs epilayers may be important in determining their physical properties.",
                "The band gap of GaAsBi epitaxial layers as a function of bismuth concentration up to 3.6% is determined. The optical transitions were measured by modulated electroreflectance. The energy of the band gap decreases at a linearized rate of 88 meV\/% Bi, or 83 meV\/% Bi for the heavy hole to conduction band transition for GaAsBi strained to GaAs. The valence-band splitting increases faster than that of GaAs under similar compressive strain whereas the temperature dependence of the observed GaAsBi transitions is similar to that of GaAs.",
                "We report on the microstructural changes of amorphous V2O5 films with lithium intercalation. The Raman spectra of as-deposited films show two broad peaks around at 520 and 650 cm\u22121, due to the stretching modes of the V3\u2013O and V2\u2013O bonds, respectively, and a relatively sharp peak at 1027 cm\u22121 due to the V5+\ue605O stretching mode of terminal oxygen atoms. In addition, there is a peak at 932 cm\u22121 that we attribute to the V4+\ue605O bonds. Comparison of the Raman spectra of V2O5 films with different oxygen deficiencies confirms this assignment. This Raman peak due to the stretching mode of the V4+\ue605O bonds develops and shifts toward lower frequencies with increasing lithium concentration. Comparison to results from gasochromic hydrogen insertion indicates that the 932 cm\u22121 Raman peak is not a result of vibrations which involve Li or H atoms. We propose that the V4+\ue605O bonds are created by two different \u2026",
                "We report a strongly nonlinear pressure dependence of the band gaps and large downward shifts of the conduction band edges as functions of composition in ZnS x Te 1\u2212 x and ZnSe y Te 1\u2212 y alloys. The dependencies are explained by an interaction between localized A 1 symmetry states of S or Se atoms and the extended states of the ZnTe matrix. These results, combined with previous studies of III-NV materials define a new, broad class of semiconductor alloys in which the introduction of highly electronegative atoms leads to dramatic modifications of the conduction band structure. The modifications are well described by the recently introduced band anticrossing model.",
                "We present the results of applying multi-layer graphene (MLG) films as transparent conductive electrodes in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). The MLG films synthesized at different growth temperatures by chemical vapor deposition were applied to OPVs. The performance of OPVs with 1000 \u00b0C-grown MLG films was found to be the best with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of \u223c1.3%. The PCE was further enhanced when a hole-blocking TiOX layer was inserted in the device structure, resulting in a PCE of \u223c2.6% which is a significantly higher efficiency compared to other previously reported graphene-adopted photovoltaic cells. Our demonstration of the PCE-increase in the graphene-electrode OPVs may foster the application of the fast-progressing graphene technology toward more practical OPV technology.",
                "We report the effects of electrochromic coloration on the Raman spectra of sputtered a-MoO3 films. The Raman spectra of as-deposited films show two strong peaks at 828 and 951 cm\u22121 due to vibrations of the O\ue5f8Mo6+\ue5f8O and Mo6+\ue605O bonds, respectively. A shoulder on the right side of the Raman peak at 951 cm\u22121 is observed, and we attribute it to the Mo6+\ue605O bonds which originate from the singly coordinated oxygen atoms in \u03b1 phase layered MoO3. When lithium (or hydrogen) ions and electrons are intercalated into a-MoO3, the overall Raman intensity decreases due to electrochromic coloration and an extra Raman peak due to the bonds between Mo5+ and oxygen atoms appears at \u223c400 cm\u22121. In addition, the force constant for the O\ue5f8Mo6+\ue5f8O bonds increases due to the compressive stress induced by lithium (or hydrogen) ion insertion. We conclude the Mo5+ states are generated as a result of the \u2026",
                "Raman spectrum of a quantum dot (QD) is characterized by transverse (TO) and longitudinal (LO) optical modes as well as surface optical modes, occurring between the TO and LO modes. We have studied in detail the size-dependence of the Raman spectrum of InP QD of diameter larger than 35 \u00c5. The LO phonon frequency decreases while the TO phonon frequency increases with decreasing QD size. The linewidth of the LO phonon broadens and the broadening becomes increasingly asymmetrical towards the low frequency side as the QD size decreases. By analyzing the Raman intensity ratio of the LO phonon to its overtone, we find that the electron-phonon coupling decreases with decreasing QD size.",
                "There has been growing research interest in the use of molybdenum disulfide in the fields of optoelectronics and energy harvesting devices, by virtue of its indirect-to-direct band gap tunability. However, obtaining large area thin films of MoS2 for future device applications still remains a challenge. In the present study, the amounts of the precursors (S and MoO3) were varied systematically in order to optimize the growth of highly crystalline and large area MoS2 layers by the chemical vapor deposition method. Careful control of the amounts of precursors was found to the key factor in the synthesis of large area highly crystalline flakes. The thickness of the layers was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The optical properties and chemical composition were studied by photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The emergence of strong direct excitonic \u2026",
                "A measurement of the hole density in the ferromagnetic semiconductor Ga 1\u2212 x Mn x As is notoriously difficult using standard transport techniques due to the dominance of the anomalous Hall effect. Here we report a spectroscopic measurement of the hole density in four Ga 1\u2212 x Mn x As samples (x= 0, 0. 0 3 8, 0.061, and 0.083) at room temperature using a Raman-scattering intensity analysis of the coupled plasmon\u2013LO-phonon mode and the unscreened LO phonon. The unscreened LO-phonon frequency linearly decreases as the Mn concentration increases up to 8.3%. The hole density determined from the Raman scattering shows a monotonic increase with increasing x for x<~ 0. 0 8 3, exhibiting a direct correlation to the observed T c. The optical technique reported here provides an unambiguous means of determining the hole density in this important class of \u201cspintronic\u201d semiconductor materials.",
                "Microstructural changes of amorphous V2O5 films with lithium intercalation are studied using Raman-scattering measurements. The Raman spectra of as-deposited films show two broad peaks around at 520 and 650 cm\u22121, due to the stretching modes of the V3\u2013O and V2\u2013O bonds, respectively, and a relatively sharp peak at 1027 cm\u22121 due to the V5+=O stretching mode of terminal oxygen atoms. In addition, there is a peak at 932 cm\u22121 that we attribute to the V4+=O bonds. Comparison of the Raman spectra of V2O5 films with different oxygen deficiencies confirms this assignment. This Raman peak due to the stretching mode of the V4+=O bonds develops and shifts toward lower frequencies with increasing lithium concentration.
