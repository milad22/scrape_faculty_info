                "This letter presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production using up to 36.1 fb\u2212 1 of proton\u2013proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy s= 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the b b\u00af b b\u00af, b b\u00af W+ W\u2212, b b\u00af \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, W+ W\u2212 W+ W\u2212, b b\u00af \u03b3 \u03b3 and W+ W\u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. No statistically significant excess in data above the Standard Model predictions is found. The combined observed (expected) limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 (10) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (\u03ba \u03bb) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level in \u2026",
                "Electron and photon triggers covering transverse energies from 5  to several  are essential for the ATLAS experiment to record signals for a wide variety of physics: from Standard Model processes to searches for new phenomena in both proton\u2013proton and heavy-ion collisions. To cope with a fourfold increase of peak LHC luminosity from 2015 to 2018 (Run 2), to , and a similar increase in the number of interactions per beam-crossing to about 60, trigger algorithms and selections were optimised to control the rates while retaining a high efficiency for physics analyses. For proton\u2013proton collisions, the single-electron trigger efficiency relative to a single-electron offline selection is at least 75% for an offline electron of 31 , and rises to 96% at 60 ; the trigger efficiency of a 25  leg of the primary diphoton trigger relative to a tight offline photon selection is more than 96% for an offline photon of \u2026",
                "A search for new resonances decaying into a pair of jets is reported using the dataset of proton-proton collisions recorded at= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u2212 1. The distribution of the invariant mass of the two leading jets is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of the Standard Model background. In addition to an inclusive dijet search, events with jets identified as containing b-hadrons are examined specifically. No significant excess of events above the smoothly falling background spectra is observed. The results are used to set cross-section upper limits at 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Model-independent limits on Gaussian-shaped signals are also reported. The analysis looking at jets containing b-hadrons benefits from improvements in the jet flavour \u2026",
                "Measurements of fiducial integrated and differential cross sections for inclusive W+, W-and Z boson production are reported. They are based on 25.0\u00b10.5 pb-1 of pp collision data at s= 5.02 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Electron and muon decay channels are analysed, and the combined W+, W-and Z integrated cross sections are found to be \u03c3W+= 2266\u00b19 (stat)\u00b129 (syst)\u00b143 (lumi) pb, \u03c3W-= 1401\u00b17 (stat)\u00b118 (syst)\u00b127 (lumi) pb, and \u03c3Z= 374.5\u00b13.4 (stat)\u00b13.6 (syst)\u00b17.0 (lumi) pb, in good agreement with next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD cross-section calculations. These measurements serve as references for Pb+ Pb interactions at the LHC at sNN= 5.02 TeV.",
                "The ATLAS detector [1] at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)[2] is a multipurpose particle detector, optimised to exploit the full physics potential of high-energy proton-proton (pp) and heavy-ion collisions. This includes the study of the Higgs boson, precise measurements of Standard Model processes, searches for rare and new phenomena, as well as the study of the properties and states of matter at high temperatures. ATLAS has over 100 million electronic channels, which provide read-out for multiple, distinct detector subsystems, each featuring dedicated technologies to serve a specific purpose. During data-taking it is important that data are available from all detector subsystems, and that they are free from integrity issues. It is possible that data from one or more individual detector components may occasionally be compromised. This could happen, for example, as a result of a surge in noise from detector \u2026",
                "This paper presents results of searches for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in models with compressed mass spectra. The searches use 139 fb\u2212 1 of s= 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Events with missing transverse momentum and two same-flavor, oppositely charged, low-transverse-momentum leptons are selected, and are further categorized by the presence of hadronic activity from initial-state radiation or a topology compatible with vector-boson fusion processes. The data are found to be consistent with predictions from the Standard Model. The results are interpreted using simplified models of R-parity-conserving supersymmetry in which the lightest supersymmetric partner is a neutralino with a mass similar to the lightest chargino, the second-to-lightest neutralino, or the slepton. Lower limits on the masses of charginos \u2026",
                "A search for a heavy charged-boson resonance decaying into a charged lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino is reported. A data sample of 139 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collisions at s= 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015\u20132018 is used in the search. The observed transverse mass distribution computed from the lepton and missing transverse momenta is consistent with the distribution expected from the Standard Model, and upper limits on the cross section for p p\u2192 W\u2032\u2192 \u2113 \u03bd are extracted (\u2113= e or \u03bc). These vary between 1.3 pb and 0.05 fb depending on the resonance mass in the range between 0.15 and 7.0 TeV at 95% confidence level for the electron and muon channels combined. Gauge bosons with a mass below 6.0 and 5.1 TeV are excluded in the electron and muon channels, respectively, in a model with a resonance that has couplings to fermions identical to those of the \u2026",
                "\u00a9 2020, The Author (s). A search for Higgs boson pair production via vector-boson fusion (VBF) in the bb bb final state is carried out with the ATLAS experiment using 126 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collision data delivered at s= 13 TeV by the Large Hadron Collider. This search is sensitive to VBF production of additional heavy bosons that may decay into Higgs boson pairs, and in a non-resonant topology it can constrain the quartic coupling between the Higgs bosons and vector bosons. No significant excess relative to the Standard Model expectation is observed, and limits on the production cross-section are set at the 95% confidence level for a heavy scalar resonance in the context of an extended Higgs sector, and for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Interpretation in terms of the coupling between a Higgs boson pair and two vector bosons is also provided: coupling values normalised to the Standard Model expectation of \u03ba2V<\u2212 0.76 and \u03ba2V> 2.90 are excluded at the 95% confidence level in data.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]",
                "A search for the direct production of the supersymmetric partners of \u03c4-leptons (staus) in final states with two hadronically decaying \u03c4-leptons is presented. The analysis uses a dataset of p p collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u2212 1, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant deviation from the expected Standard Model background is observed. Limits are derived in scenarios of direct production of stau pairs with each stau decaying into the stable lightest neutralino and one \u03c4-lepton in simplified models where the two stau mass eigenstates are degenerate. Stau masses from 120 GeV to 390 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a massless lightest neutralino.",

The signal selection requires a pair of b-tagged jets consistent with those from a Higgs boson decay, and either an electron or a muon from the W boson decay, together with missing transverse momentum from the corresponding neutrino and the stable neutralinos. The analysis is based on data corresponding to 139 of TeV pp collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector. No statistically significant evidence of an excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is found. Limits are set on the direct production of the electroweakinos in simplified models, assuming pure wino cross-sections. Masses \u2026"
