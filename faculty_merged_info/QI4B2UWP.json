                "Phillip Sprunger Professor of Physics Ph.D., 1993 - University of Pennsylvania 217-B Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-1254-Office phils@lsu.edu Research Home Page Experimental Condensed Matter Physics Our research group is focused on understanding interconnecting atomic\/morphological,\n                     electronic\/magnetic and chemical\/chemisorption properties of various surface\/thin-film\/nanophase\n                     systems using complementary experimental probes. This includes employing synchrotron-based-VUV\n                     photoemission (high-resolution and spin-resolved), -IR spectromicroscopy, -x-ray absorption,\n                     along with electron energy-loss spectroscopy, and variable-temperature scanning tunneling\n                     microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Systems that are currently being investigated\n                     include heteroepitaxially grown metal-on-metal (e.g. Ag\/Cu, Co\/Ag, Ag nanowires\/Cu)\n                     and metal-on-semiconductor systems (e.g. Ag\/GaAs, Be\/Si), intermetallic alloy thin-film\n                     and surface systems (e.g. FeAl), simple and complex adsorbate and biological overlayers\n                     (amino acid\/polymers\/SiO2 and Au), polymer photo-induced degradation, and metal on\n                     metal-oxide nano-structures (e.g. Ag\/Al 2 \/O3\/FeAl). Research emphasis is on correlating electronic\/magnetic\/photonic properties\n                     (hybridization, band-structure electron-phonon, electron-electron interactions) with\n                     atomic structure (STM, AFM, LEED, SEXAFS).
