                "tbogdanovic6 Prof. Tamara Bogdanovi\u0107 Associate Professor Ph.D., Astrophysics, Pennsylvania State University B.Sc., Astrophysics, University of Belgrade, Serbia My research interests are in astrophysics of some of the most massive black holes in the universe, a.k.a., supermassive black holes . Within my group we investigate the physical processes that arise in accretion flows around supermassive black holes and use them as luminous tracers of these otherwise dark objects. Some of the scenarios we study include the accretion of gas by the single and binary supermassive black holes as well as the accretion of stars that happen to be disrupted by the black hole tides in galactic nuclei. My goal as a theorist is to predict the signatures of these interactions which can be searched for in observations, as well as to provide interpretation for some of the puzzling astrophysical events seen on the sky. In a nutshell, my research interest include: Black hole astrophysics Accretion physics Physics of the intracluster medium Computational astrophysics 2018 Class of 1940 Course Survey Teaching Effectiveness Award 2018 Leddy Family Faculty Fellow 2017 Provost Teaching & Learning Fellow 2016 Cullen-Peck Fellow 2016 Cottrell Scholar 2013 Sloan Research Fellow 2009 Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow 2006 Astronomy Prize Theory Postdoc Fellow Publication list via NASA\u00a0Astrophysics Data System tamarab@gatech.edu (404) 385-0113 Boggs 1-90H Teaching Research website"
