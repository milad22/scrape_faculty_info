                "The optimization of traditional electrocatalysts has reached a point where progress is impeded by fundamental physical factors including inherent scaling relations among thermokinetic characteristics of different elementary reaction steps, non\u2010Nernstian behavior, and electronic structure of the catalyst. This indicates that the currently utilized classes of electrocatalysts may not be adequate for future needs. This study reports on synthesis and characterization of a new class of materials based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides including sulfides, selenides, and tellurides of group V and VI transition metals that exhibit excellent catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in an aprotic medium with Li salts. The reaction rates are much higher for these materials than previously reported catalysts for these reactions. The reasons for the high activity are found to be the metal edges with \u2026",
                "Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) alloys could have a wide range of physical and chemical properties, ranging from charge density waves to superconductivity and electrochemical activities. While many exciting behaviors of unary TMDCs have been demonstrated, the vast compositional space of TMDC alloys has remained largely unexplored due to the lack of understanding regarding their stability when accommodating different cations or chalcogens in a single\u2010phase. Here, a theory\u2010guided synthesis approach is reported to achieve unexplored quasi\u2010binary TMDC alloys through computationally predicted stability maps. Equilibrium temperature\u2013composition phase diagrams using first\u2010principles calculations are generated to identify the stability of 25 quasi\u2010binary TMDC alloys, including some involving non\u2010isovalent cations and are verified experimentally through the synthesis of a subset of 12 predicted \u2026",
                "Control over the nucleation and growth of lead-halide perovskite crystals is critical to obtain semiconductor films with high quantum yields in optoelectronic devices. In this report, we use the change in fluorescence brightness to image the transformation of individual lead bromide (PbBr2) nanocrystals to methylammonium lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) via intercalation of CH3NH3Br. Analyzing this reaction one nanocrystal at a time reveals information that is masked when the fluorescence intensity is averaged over many particles. Sharp rises in the intensity of single nanocrystals indicate they transform much faster than the time it takes for the ensemble average to transform. While the ensemble reaction rate increases with increasing CH3NH3Br concentration, the intensity rises for individual nanocrystals are insensitive to the CH3NH3Br concentration. To explain these observations, we propose a phase \u2026",
                "In this Letter, we used fluorescence microscopy to image the reversible transformation of individual CsPbCl3 nanocrystals to CsPbBr3, which enables us to quantify heterogeneity in reactivity among hundreds of nanocrystals prepared within the same batch. We observed a wide distribution of waiting times for individual nanocrystals to react as has been seen previously for cation exchange and ion intercalation. However, a significant difference for this reaction is that the switching times for changes in fluorescence intensity are dependent on the concentration of substitutional halide ions in solution (i.e., Br\u2013 or Cl\u2013). On the basis of the high solid-state miscibility between CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3, we develop a model in which the activation energy for anion exchange depends on the density of exchanged ions in the nanocrystal. The heterogeneity in reaction kinetics observed among individual nanocrystals limits the \u2026",
                "2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), graphene, and boron nitride, are seen as promising materials for future high power\/high frequency electronics. However, the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) between many of these 2D materials could impose a serious challenge for the design of monolayer\u2010material\u2010based nanodevices. To address this challenge, alloy engineering of TMDs is used to tailor their TECs. Here, in situ heating experiments in a scanning transmission electron microscope are combined with electron energy\u2010loss spectroscopy and first\u2010principles modeling of monolayer Mo1\u2212xWxS2 with different alloying concentrations to determine the TEC. Significant changes in the TEC are seen as a function of chemical composition in Mo1\u2212xWxS2, with the smallest TEC being reported for a configuration with the highest entropy. This study provides key insights \u2026"
