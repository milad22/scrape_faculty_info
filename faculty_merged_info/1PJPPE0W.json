                "Wai-Yee  Keung, PhD Professor 2252 SES (312) 413-2778 keung@uic.edu Professor Keung's research interests have centered around questions which are related to current high energy physics phenomenology, such as the properties of the top quark, the origin of CP violation, the formation of quarkonium states and the precision measurement of electroweak parameters. Professor Keung in recent years, he has been invited to give lectures on Collider Physics at Fermilab in US, at KEK in Japan, and at NCTS in Taiwan.
