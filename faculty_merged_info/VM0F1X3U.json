                "First-and second-order Raman scattering from graphite has been studied. The second-order spectra of single crystals and of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite are continuous and exhibit several well-defined bands which can be attributed to features in the density of vibrational states as determined from current lattice-dynamics models. The density of states deduced from the lattice-dynamics model of Nicklow, Wakabayashi, and Smith provides the best replication of the second-order Raman spectrum, but is nevertheless somewhat deficient in this regard, and in need of improvement. The dependence of the first-and second-order graphite Raman spectra on crystallite size has also been studied for a series of samples with typical dimensions L c and L a as small as 30 \u00c5. With decreasing crystal size the features in the second-order spectrum broaden noticeably and additional broad features appear in both the first-and \u2026",
                "The ir and Raman spectra of a-Si: H alloys produced by plasma decomposition of Si H 4 are studied for a wide range of deposition conditions. The vibrational spectra display modes which can be characterized as predominantly hydrogen motions. Analysis of these modes shows four types of local Si-H bonding environments which are identified as SiH, Si H 2, Si H 3, and coupled Si H 2 or (Si H 2) n units. On the basis of these identifications, it is found that samples produced on high-temperature (above 200 C) substrates have SiH, Si H 2, and (Si H 2) n groups with very little Si H 3. In contrast, the ir and Raman spectra of samples produced on room-temperature or cooled substrates are dominated by vibrational modes of Si H 3 and (Si H 2) n. The relative concentrations of these hydrogen-containing groups are not simply proportional to the total hydrogen concentration in a given sample."
