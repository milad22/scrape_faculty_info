                "Combining our results for various O (\u03b1 s 2) corrections to the weak radiative B-meson decay, we are able to present the first estimate of the branching ratio at the next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. We find B (B\u2192 X s \u03b3)=(3.15\u00b10.23)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 for E \u03b3> 1.6 GeV in the B-meson rest frame. The four types of uncertainties: nonperturbative (5%), parametric (3%), higher-order (3%), and m c-interpolation ambiguity (3%) have been added in quadrature to obtain the total error.",
                "This Report summarizes the results of the activities of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group in the period 2014-2016. The main goal of the working group was to present the state-of-the-art of Higgs physics at the LHC, integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. The first part compiles the most up-to-date predictions of Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios, parton distribution functions, and off-shell Higgs boson production and interference effects. The second part discusses the recent progress in Higgs effective field theory predictions, followed by the third part on pseudo-observables, simplified template cross section and fiducial cross section measurements, which give the baseline framework for Higgs boson property measurements. The fourth part deals with the beyond the Standard Model predictions of various benchmark scenarios of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, extended scalar sector, Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and exotic Higgs boson decays. This report follows three previous working-group reports: Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002), Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002), and Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 3. Higgs properties (CERN-2013-004). The current report serves as the baseline reference for Higgs physics in LHC Run 2 and beyond.",
                "Precision predictions for phenomenologically interesting observables such as the invariant mass distribution and forward-backward asymmetry in top-quark pair production at hadron colliders require control over the differential cross section in perturbative QCD. In this paper we improve existing calculations of the doubly differential cross section in the invariant mass and scattering angle by using techniques from soft-collinear effective theory to perform an NNLL resummation of threshold logarithms, which become large when the invariant mass M of the top-quark pair approaches the partonic center-of-mass energy. We also derive an approximate formula for the differential cross section at NNLO in fixed-order perturbation theory, which completely determines the coefficients multiplying the singular plus distributions in the variable. We then match our results in the threshold region with the exact results at \u2026",
                "Weak radiative decays of the B mesons belong to the most important flavor changing processes that provide constraints on physics at the TeV scale. In the derivation of such constraints, accurate standard model predictions for the inclusive branching ratios play a crucial role. In the current Letter we present an update of these predictions, incorporating all our results for the O (\u03b1 s 2) and lower-order perturbative corrections that have been calculated after 2006. New estimates of nonperturbative effects are taken into account, too. For the C P-and isospin-averaged branching ratios, we find B s \u03b3=(3.36\u00b10.23)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 and B d \u03b3=(1.7 3\u2212 0.22+ 0.12)\u00d7 10\u2212 5, for E \u03b3> 1.6 GeV. Both results remain in agreement with the current experimental averages. Normalizing their sum to the inclusive semileptonic branching ratio, we obtain R \u03b3\u2261(B s \u03b3+ B d \u03b3)\/B c \u2113 \u03bd=(3.31\u00b10.22)\u00d7 10\u2212 3.

                "The infrared divergences of QCD scattering amplitudes can be derived from an anomalous dimension \u0393, which is a matrix in color space and depends on the momenta and masses of the external partons. It has recently been shown that in cases where there are at least two massive partons involved in the scattering process, starting at two-loop order \u0393 receives contributions involving color and momentum correlations between three (and more) partons. The three-parton correlations can be described by two universal functions F 1 and f 2. In this paper these functions are calculated at two-loop order in closed analytic form and their properties are studied in detail. Both functions are found to be suppressed like Script O (m 4\/s 2) in the limit of small parton masses, in accordance with mass factorization theorems proposed in the literature. On the other hand, both functions are Script O (1) and even diverge logarithmically \u2026",
                "We use techniques from soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) to derive renormalization-group improved predictions for single-particle inclusive (1PI) observables in top-quark pair production at hadron colliders. In particular, we study the top-quark transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions, the forward-backward asymmetry at the Tevatron, and the total cross section at NLO+ NNLL order in resummed perturbation theory and at approximate NNLO in fixed order. We also perform a detailed analysis of power corrections to the leading terms in the threshold expansion of the partonic hard-scattering kernels. We conclude that, although the threshold expansion in 1PI kinematics is susceptible to numerically significant power corrections, its predictions for the total cross section are in good agreement with those obtained by integrating the top-pair invariant-mass distribution in pair invariant-mass kinematics, as long as \u2026",
                "The series Lecture Notes in Physics (LNP), founded in 1969, reports new developments in physics research and teaching-quickly and informally, but with a high quality and the explicit aim to summarize and communicate current knowledge in an accessible way. Books published in this series are conceived as bridging material between advanced graduate textbooks and the forefront of research and to serve three purposes:\u2022 to be a compact and modern up-to-date source of reference on a well-defined topic\u2022 to serve as an accessible introduction to the field to postgraduate students and nonspecialist researchers from related areas\u2022 to be a source of advanced teaching material for specialized seminars, courses and schoolsBoth monographs and multi-author volumes will be considered for publication.

                "A detailed investigation is presented of a set of algorithms which form the basis for a fast and reliable numerical integration of one-loop multi-leg (up to six) Feynman diagrams, with special attention to the behavior around (possibly) singular points in phase space. No particular restriction is imposed on kinematics, and complex masses (poles) are allowed.",
                "We make use of recent results in effective theory and higher-order perturbative calculations to improve the theoretical predictions of the top-quark pair production cross section at hadron colliders. In particular, we supplement the fixed-order NLO calculation with higher-order corrections from soft gluon resummation at NNLL accuracy. Uncertainties due to power corrections to the soft limit are estimated by combining results from single-particle inclusive and pair invariant-mass kinematics. We present our predictions as functions of the top-quark mass in both the pole scheme and the M S\u00af scheme. We also discuss the merits of using threshold masses as an alternative, and calculate the cross section with the top-quark mass defined in the 1S scheme as an illustrative example.",
                "We provide a complete description of the two-loop infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary number of massive and massless partons in non-Abelian gauge theories. To this end, we calculate the two universal functions that completely specify the structure of three-parton correlations in the soft anomalous-dimension matrix at two-loop order in closed analytic form. Both functions are found to be suppressed like O (m 4\/s 2) in the limit of small parton masses, in accordance with mass factorization theorems. On the other hand, they are unsuppressed near the threshold for pair production of two heavy particles. As an application, we calculate the two-loop anomalous-dimension matrix for q q\u2192 t t near threshold and show that it is not diagonal in the s-channel singlet-octet basis."
