                "Using high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry, we assessed trough imatinib plasma levels in 68 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who responded or not to standard-dose imatinib, after at least 12 months' treatment. Mean trough imatinib plasma levels were significantly higher in the group with complete cytogenetic response (56 patients) than in the group without (12 patients; P = .03) and higher in the group with major molecular response (MMR) than in the group without (34 patients [1452 \u00b1 649 ng\/mL] versus 34 patients [869 \u00b1 427 ng\/mL]; P < .001). Regarding trough imatinib plasma levels and their discrimination potential for MMR, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.775, with best sensitivity (77%) and specificity (71%) at a plasma threshold of 1002 ng\/mL. Therefore, monitoring of imatinib plasma levels could be very useful for the \u2026",
                "  Aims \u2007To assess the frequency and cost of drug reactions causing or prolonging hospitalization.  Methods \u2007All patients admitted to an internal medicine ward over 6 months were evaluated to identify serious adverse reactions. The number of drug classes on admission or at the time of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) was counted. Excess ADR\u2010related hospital stay was computed using a) raw excess duration of hospital stay, b) correction of duration of hospital stay by age, sex, and number of drug classes, and c) estimation by investigator of excess hospital stay.  Results \u2007Three hundred and twenty\u2010nine patients were evaluated: 212 male, 117 female, mean age 57.2 (males: 52.2, females: 66.2 (P<0.05)), range 17\u201395 years. They stayed a total of 3720 hospital days (mean stay 11.3 days). 298 had no ADR (mean age 55.8, taking a mean of 2.7 drug classes, 10.7 days hospital \u2026",
                "The correct use of inhalation devices is an inclusion criterion for all studies comparing inhaled treatments. In real life, however, patients may make many errors with their usual inhalation device, which          may negate the benefits observed in clinical trials. Our study was undertaken to compare inhalation device handling in real life. A total of 3811 patients treated for at least 1 month with an inhalation          device (Aerolizer\u00ae, Autohaler\u00ae, Diskus\u00ae, pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), or Turbuhaler\u00ae) were included in this observational study performed          in primary care in France between February 1st and July 14th, 2002. General practitioners had to assess patient handling of their usual inhaler device with the help of a checklist established for each inhaler          model, from the package leaflet. Seventy-six percent of patients made at least one error with pMDI compared to 49-55% with breath-actuated \u2026",
                "We ran a randomized cross-over design study under sleep-deprived and non-sleep-deprived driving conditions to test the effects of sleep restriction on real driving performance. The study was performed in a sleep laboratory and on an open French highway. Twenty-two healthy male subjects (age = 21.5 \u00b1 2 years; distance driven per year = 12,225 \u00b1 4739 km (7641 \u00b1 2962 miles) [mean \u00b1 S.D.]) drove 1000 km (625 miles) over 10 h during five 105 min sessions on an open highway.Self-rated fatigue and sleepiness before each session, number of inappropriate line crossings from video recordings and simple reaction time (RT) were measured.Total crossings increased after sleep restriction (535 crossings in the sleep-restricted condition versus 66 after non-restricted sleep (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 8.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 3.2\u201320.5; p < 0.001)), from the first driving session.

                "Pre-clinical studies, active-control clinical trials and meta-analyses indicate that escitalopram (S-citalopram) might be more effective than citalopram, the racemic mixture of S-and R-citalopram. The present study aimed to confirm the superior efficacy of escitalopram over citalopram. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was performed in which general practitioners and psychiatrists compared fixed doses of escitalopram (20 mg\/day) with citalopram (40 mg\/day) over 8 weeks in outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD)[baseline Montgomery\u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score\u2265 30]. Primary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to last assessment in the MADRS total score. Out of 138 (aged 44.1\u00b110.9 years; initial MADRS score 36.3\u00b14.8) and 142 (aged 46.2\u00b111.1 years; initial MADRS score 35.7\u00b14.4) evaluable patients who were randomized to escitalopram and citalopram \u2026",
                "Young subjects are frequently involved in sleep\u2010related accidents. They could be more affected than older drivers by sleep loss and therefore worsen their driving skills quicker, or have a different perception of their level of impairment. To test these hypotheses we studied variations of reaction time (RT), a fundamental prerequisite for safe performing, as measured by lapses, i.e. responses \u2265500\u2003ms and self\u2010assessment of performance and sleepiness after a night awake and after a night asleep in a balanced crossover design in young versus older healthy subjects. Ten young (20\u201325\u2003years old) and 10 older volunteers (52\u201363\u2003years old) were tested with and without 24\u2003h of sleep deprivation. Without sleep deprivation, RTs were slower in older subjects than in the younger ones. However, after sleep deprivation, the RTs of young subjects increased while that of the older subjects remained almost unaffected \u2026"
