                "We present a formalism for analyzing a full-sky temperature and polarization map of the cosmic microwave background. Temperature maps are analyzed by expanding over the set of spherical harmonics to give multipole moments of the two-point correlation function. Polarization, which is described by a second-rank tensor, can be treated analogously by expanding in the appropriate tensor spherical harmonics. We provide expressions for the complete set of temperature and polarization multipole moments for scalar and tensor metric perturbations. Four sets of multipole moments completely describe isotropic temperature and polarization correlations; for scalar metric perturbations one set is identically zero, giving the possibility of a clean determination of the vector and tensor contributions. The variance with which the multipole moments can be measured in idealized experiments is evaluated, including the effects \u2026",
                "A formalism for describing an all-sky map of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background is presented. The polarization pattern on the sky can be decomposed into two geometrically distinct components. One of these components is not coupled to density inhomogeneities. A nonzero amplitude for this component of polarization can only be caused by tensor or vector metric perturbations. This allows unambiguous identification of long-wavelength gravity waves or large-scale vortical flows at the time of last scattering.",
                "The angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) contains information on virtually all cosmological parameters of interest, including the geometry of the Universe (\u03a9), the baryon density, the Hubble constant (h), the cosmological constant (\u039b), the number of light neutrinos, the ionization history, and the amplitudes and spectral indices of the primordial scalar and tensor perturbation spectra. We review the imprint of each parameter on the CMB. Assuming only that the primordial perturbations were adiabatic, we use a covariance-matrix approach to estimate the precision with which these parameters can be determined by a CMB temperature map as a function of the fraction of sky mapped, the level of pixel noise, and the angular resolution. For example, with no prior information about any of the cosmological parameters, a full-sky CMB map with 0.5 angular resolution and a noise level of 15 \u03bcK \u2026",
                "We consider the stochastic background of gravity waves produced by first-order cosmological phase transitions from two types of sources: colliding bubbles and hydrodynamic turbulence. First we discuss the fluid mechanics of relativistic spherical combustion. We then numerically collide many bubbles expanding at a velocity v and calculate the resulting spectrum of gravitational radiation in the linearized gravity approximation. Our results are expressed as simple functions of the mean bubble separation, the bubble expansion velocity, the latent heat, and the efficiency of converting latent heat to kinetic energy of the bubble walls. A first-order phase transition is also likely to excite a Kolmogoroff spectrum of turbulence. We estimate the gravity waves produced by such a spectrum of turbulence and find that the characteristic amplitude of the gravity waves produced is comparable to that from bubble collisions. Finally \u2026",
                "We present cosmological parameters derived from the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed at 148 GHz and 218 GHz over 296 deg 2 with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) during its 2008 season. ACT measures fluctuations at scales 500< \u2113< 10, 000. We fit a model for the lensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz and 218 GHz power spectra, including thermal and kinetic SZ, Poisson power from radio and infrared point sources, and clustered power from infrared point sources. At \u2113= 3000, about half the power at 148 GHz comes from primary CMB after masking bright radio sources. The power from thermal and kinetic SZ is estimated to be , where . The IR Poisson power at 148 GHz is (C \u2113= 5.5\u00b10.5 nK 2), and a clustered IR component is required with \u2026",
                "We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey on the celestial equator. With this addition, the ACT collaboration has reported a total of 91 optically confirmed, SZ detected clusters. The 504 square degree survey region includes 270 square degrees of overlap with SDSS Stripe 82, permitting the confirmation of SZ cluster candidates in deep archival optical data. The subsample of 48 clusters within Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90% complete for M 500c> 4.5\u00d7 10 14 M\u2299 and redshifts 0.15< z< 0.8. While a full suite of matched filters is used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a''Profile Based Amplitude Analysis''using a statistic derived from a single filter at a fixed \u03b8 500= 5 farcm 9 angular scale. This new approach incorporates the cluster redshift along with \u2026",
                "This book lays out the scientific goals to be addressed by the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment, CMB-S4, envisioned to consist of dedicated telescopes at the South Pole, the high Chilean Atacama plateau and possibly a northern hemisphere site, all equipped with new superconducting cameras. CMB-S4 will dramatically advance cosmological studies by crossing critical thresholds in the search for the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves, in the determination of the number and masses of the neutrinos, in the search for evidence of new light relics, in constraining the nature of dark energy, and in testing general relativity on large scales.",
                "We present constraints on cosmological and astrophysical parameters from high-resolution microwave background maps at 148 GHz and 218 GHz made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in three seasons of observations from 2008 to 2010. A model of primary cosmological and secondary foreground parameters is fit to the map power spectra and lensing deflection power spectrum, including contributions from both the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, Poisson and correlated anisotropy from unresolved infrared sources, radio sources, and the correlation between the tSZ effect and infrared sources. The power \u2113 2 C \u2113\/2\u03c0 of the thermal SZ power spectrum at 148 GHz is measured to be 3.4\u00b11.4 \u03bcK 2 at \u2113= 3000, while the corresponding amplitude of the kinematic SZ power spectrum has a 95% confidence level upper limit of 8.6 \u03bcK 2.

                "In the linearized-gravity approximation we numerically compute the amount of gravitational radiation produced by the collision of two true-vacuum bubbles in Minkowski space. The bubbles are separated by distance d and we calculate the amount of gravitational radiation that is produced in a time \u03c4\u223c d (in a cosmological phase transition \u03c4 corresponds to the duration of the transition, which is expected to be of the order of the mean bubble separation d). Our approximations are generally valid for \u03c4\u2272 H\u2212 1. We find that the amount of gravitational radiation produced depends only upon the grossest features of the collision: the time \u03c4 and the energy density associated with the false-vacuum state, \u03c1 vac. In particular, the spectrum dE GW\/d\u03c9\u221d \u03c1 vac 2 \u03c4 6 and peaks at a characteristic frequency \u03c9 max\u2243 3.8\/\u03c4, and the fraction of the vacuum energy released into gravitational waves is about 1.3\u00d7 10\u2212 3 (\u03c4\/H\u2212 1) 2, where H 2 \u2026",
                "We report on 23 clusters detected blindly as Sunyaev-ZEL'DOVICH (SZ) decrements in a 148 GHz, 455 deg 2 map of the southern sky made with data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope 2008 observing season. All SZ detections announced in this work have confirmed optical counterparts. Ten of the clusters are new discoveries. One newly discovered cluster, ACT-CL J0102\u20134915, with a redshift of 0.75 (photometric), has an SZ decrement comparable to the most massive systems at lower redshifts. Simulations of the cluster recovery method reproduce the sample purity measured by optical follow-up. In particular, for clusters detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than six, simulations are consistent with optical follow-up that demonstrated this subsample is 100% pure. The simulations further imply that the total sample is 80% complete for clusters with mass in excess of 6\u00d7 10 14 solar masses referenced to \u2026"

                "Arthur Kosowsky Professor and Department Chairperson 315 Allen Hall (412) 624-9571 kosowsky@pitt.edu My research focuses on cosmology and related issues of theoretical physics. I have done extensive work on the theory of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the ways in which it constrains our models of the universe. Current microwave observations, combined with optical observations of the large-scale galaxy distribution, cosmic abundances of light elements, and the supernova-1a Hubble diagram, combine to give tight constraints on the properties of the universe. The resulting \"standard model\" fits most observations well, but is troubling theoretically: our best guess says that only 4 percent of the universe's energy density is in the form of ordinary matter, 26 percent is made of as-yet undetected dark matter (which does not interact either via the strong or electromagnetic forces), and the remaining 70 percent is in an even stranger \"dark energy\", evenly distributed in space and having a negative effective pressure. Theorists have a number of good candidates for the dark matter particles, which are currently being pursued by many experimental groups, including the high energy experiment group at Pitt. Current ideas as to the nature of dark energy are all highly speculative. We have a variety of observations to test our model of cosmology; these include the temperature and polarization fluctuations in the microwave background radiation, gravitational lensing, dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and the large-scale distribution and velocities of galaxies and galaxy clusters. I am interested in possible alternatives to the standard cosmological model, and observational tests which can distinguish particular alternatives from the standard cosmology. As an example, the \"dark energy\" may actually be telling us that the usual equations describing the expansion of the universe, based on general relativity, are not valid; in other words, we could be observing not the result of a mysterious form of energy density but rather the breakdown of our basic theory of gravitation. I also think about observations which are, to some extent, unexpected in the standard cosmological model, particularly \"anomalies\" in the microwave sky. All current anomalies, particularly the power spectrum asymmetry and the suppressed correlation function at large scales, can be probed to much higher precision using future polarization maps of the microwave sky ( Ph.D. thesis topic of Simone Aiola 2016 ). The standard model of cosmology strongly suggests that the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion, known as inflation, in its first moments. Inflation naturally explains why the universe is spatially flat, highly isotropic, and lacking in magnetic monopoles from grand-unified symmetry breaking to the standard model of particle physics. It also provides a mechanism for generating small density perturbations in the universe, which have gaussian random statistics, a power spectrum nearly but not quite scale invariant, and with equal fractional perturbations in all matter components. To a very good approximation, this is what our universe looks like. However, we have no realistic physical theory of inflation, and phenomenological models based on a classical scalar field with some specified potential lack a clear physical interpretation and require finely-tuned initial conditions. I am interested in constructing more realistic models , based on known properties of quantum fields in curved spacetimes, which explain how inflation began, the mechanism fueling the inflationary expansion, and the dynamical evolution of the universe throughout the inflationary epoch (current research topic of Fernando Zago). Future detection of a gravitational radiation background produced by inflation can put strong constraints on the expansion history of the universe during inflation ( Ph.D. thesis topic of Jerod Caligiuri 2016 ). On the observational side, I am a member of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) project, which built a custom-designed 6-meter microwave telescope with superconducting bolometric detectors to observe the microwave sky from the Atacama Desert in the Chilean Andes. ACT has produced microwave maps with arcminute angular resolution in three frequency bands. Notable ACT achievements have included the first direct detection of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the first detection of seven acoustic peaks in the microwave background power spectrum , improved constraints on the parameters describing the standard cosmology , the first detection of galaxy cluster motions via their imprint on the microwave background radiation, and detection of one of the earliest and largest galaxy clusters . The second-generation receiver with polarization capability, known as ACTPol , was installed on the telescope in 2013, and the third season of ACTPol observations finished in January 2016. Former Pitt graduate student Simone Aiola has been one of the primary mapmakers for these data, and the collaboration is now working on a series of papers characterizing the signals in the new maps.\u00a0 The third-generation Advanced ACT polarized receiver, which will eventually map half of the sky in 5 frequency bands, completed its first observing season in December 2016, using a new dichroic detector array and rotating half-wave plates to control systematic errors at large angular scales. The ACTPol maps have significant overlap with various optical surveys, particularly the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Advanced ACT intends to cover much of the sky region which will be observed by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) beginning after 2020. The combination of microwave maps and optical maps leads to numerous probes of fundamental physics and astrophysics. Primary science goals for Advanced ACT include detection of inflationary gravitational waves via B-mode polarization , neutrino masses via gravitational lensing, growth of structure via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect ( Ph.D. thesis topic of Suman Bhattacharya 2008 ),\u00a0 tests of dark energy versus modified gravity , constraints on reionization of the universe , and probes of quasar feedback in galaxies ( Ph.D. thesis topic of Suchetana Chatterjee 2009 ). I am also involved in the Simons Observatory , initiated in March 2016, which plans to build new microwave telescopes and detector arrays at the ACT site. So far, this is a joint effort of the ACT and Polarbear collaborations, with major financial support from the Simons Foundation. Pitt has joined the collaboration as an institutional member, and I serve on the Science Board. We anticipate this project will serve as a bridge to the ultimate ground-based microwave experiments known as S4. I am currently Divisional Associate Editor for Physical Review Letters.
