                "Platinum-based heterogeneous catalysts are critical to many important commercial chemical processes, but their efficiency is extremely low on a per metal atom basis, because only the surface active-site atoms are used. Catalysts with single-atom dispersions are thus highly desirable to maximize atom efficiency, but making them is challenging. Here we report the synthesis of a single-atom catalyst that consists of only isolated single Pt atoms anchored to the surfaces of iron oxide nanocrystallites. This single-atom catalyst has extremely high atom efficiency and shows excellent stability and high activity for both CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H 2. Density functional theory calculations show that the high catalytic activity correlates with the partially vacant 5d orbitals of the positively charged, high-valent Pt atoms, which help to reduce both the CO adsorption energy and the activation barriers for CO \u2026",
                "Supported metal nanostructures are the most widely used type of heterogeneous catalyst in industrial processes. The size of metal particles is a key factor in determining the performance of such catalysts. In particular, because low-coordinated metal atoms often function as the catalytically active sites, the specific activity per metal atom usually increases with decreasing size of the metal particles. However, the surface free energy of metals increases significantly with decreasing particle size, promoting aggregation of small clusters. Using an appropriate support material that strongly interacts with the metal species prevents this aggregation, creating stable, finely dispersed metal clusters with a high catalytic activity, an approach industry has used for a long time. Nevertheless, practical supported metal catalysts are inhomogeneous and usually consist of a mixture of sizes from nanoparticles to subnanometer clusters \u2026",
                "A cost-effective catalyst should have a high dispersion of the active atoms, together with a controllable surface structure for the optimization of activity, selectivity, or both. We fabricated nanocages by depositing a few atomic layers of platinum (Pt) as conformal shells on palladium (Pd) nanocrystals with well-defined facets and then etching away the Pd templates. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the etching is initiated via a mechanism that involves the formation of vacancies through the removal of Pd atoms incorporated into the outermost layer during the deposition of Pt. With the use of Pd nanoscale cubes and octahedra as templates, we obtained Pt cubic and octahedral nanocages enclosed by {100} and {111} facets, respectively, which exhibited distinctive catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction.",
                "The catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes is an environmentally benign technology for the production of anilines, which are key intermediates for manufacturing agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and dyes. Most of the precious metal catalysts, however, suffer from low chemoselectivity when one or more reducible groups are present in a nitroarene molecule. Herein we report FeO x-supported platinum single-atom and pseudo-single-atom structures as highly active, chemoselective and reusable catalysts for hydrogenation of a variety of substituted nitroarenes. For hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, the catalyst yields a TOF of~ 1,500 h\u2212 1, 20-fold higher than the best result reported in literature, and a selectivity to 3-aminostyrene close to 99%, the best ever achieved over platinum group metals. The superior performance can be attributed to the presence of positively charged platinum centres and the absence of Pt\u2013Pt \u2026",
                "The recent explosive growth in research on catalysis by supported single metal atoms proves the scientific interest in this new frontier of heterogeneous catalysis. A supported single-atom catalyst (SAC) contains only isolated individual atoms dispersed on, and\/or coordinated with, the surface atoms of an appropriate support. SACs not only maximize the atom efficiency of expensive metals but also provide an alternative strategy to tune the activity and selectivity of a catalytic reaction. When single metal atoms are strongly anchored onto high-surface-area supports, SACs offer a great potential to significantly transform the field of heterogeneous catalysis, which has been critical to enabling many important technologies. In this Perspective, I discuss the most recent advances in preparing, characterizing, and catalytically testing SACs with a focus on correlating the structural perspective of the anchored single metal \u2026",
                "High specific activity and cost effectiveness of single-atom catalysts hold practical value for water gas shift (WGS) reaction toward hydrogen energy. We reported the preparation and characterization of Ir single atoms supported on FeOx (Ir1\/FeOx) catalysts, the activity of which is 1 order of magnitude higher than its cluster or nanoparticle counterparts and is even higher than those of the most active Au- or Pt-based catalysts. Extensive studies reveal that the single atoms accounted for \u223c70% of the total activity of catalysts containing single atoms, subnano clusters, and nanoparticles, thus serving as the most important active sites. The Ir single atoms seem to greatly enhance the reducibility of the FeOx support and generation of oxygen vacancies, leading to the excellent performance of the Ir1\/FeOx single-atom catalyst. The results have broad implications on designing supported metal catalysts with better \u2026",
                "The catalytic activity of noble-metal nanocrystals is mainly determined by their sizes and the facets exposed on the surface. For single crystals, it has been demonstrated that the Pd(100) surface is catalytically more active than both Pd(110) and Pd(111) surfaces for the CO oxidation reaction. Here we report the synthesis of Pd nanocrystals enclosed by {100} facets with controllable sizes in the range of 6\u201318 nm by manipulating the rate of reduction of the precursor. UV-vis spectroscopy studies indicate that the rate of reduction of Na2PdCl4 can be controlled by adjusting the concentrations of Br\u2212 and Cl\u2212 ions added to the reaction mixture. Pd nanocrystals with different sizes were immobilized on ZnO nanowires and evaluated as catalysts for CO oxidation. We found that the activity of this catalytic system for CO oxidation showed a strong dependence on the nanocrystal size. When the size of the Pd \u2026",
                "Conformal deposition of platinum as ultrathin shells on facet-controlled palladium nanocrystals offers a great opportunity to enhance the catalytic performance while reducing its loading. Here we report such a system based on palladium icosahedra. Owing to lateral confinement imposed by twin boundaries and thus vertical relaxation only, the platinum overlayers evolve into a corrugated structure under compressive strain. For the core-shell nanocrystals with an average of 2.7 platinum overlayers, their specific and platinum mass activities towards oxygen reduction are enhanced by eight-and sevenfold, respectively, relative to a commercial catalyst. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the enhancement can be attributed to the weakened binding of hydroxyl to the compressed platinum surface supported on palladium. After 10,000 testing cycles, the mass activity of the core-shell nanocrystals is still four \u2026",
                "We report a robust synthesis of Ag@Au core\u2013shell nanocubes by directly depositing Au atoms on the surfaces of Ag nanocubes as conformal, ultrathin shells. Our success relies on the introduction of a strong reducing agent to compete with and thereby block the galvanic replacement between Ag and HAuCl4. An ultrathin Au shell of 0.6 nm thick was able to protect the Ag in the core in an oxidative environment. Significantly, the core\u2013shell nanocubes exhibited surface plasmonic properties essentially identical to those of the original Ag nanocubes, while the SERS activity showed a 5.4-fold further enhancement owing to an improvement in chemical enhancement. The combination of excellent SERS activity and chemical stability may enable a variety of new applications.",
                "Au\/CeO2 catalysts are highly active for low-temperature CO oxidation and water\u2013gas shift reaction, but they deactivate rapidly because of sintering of gold nanoparticles, linked to the collapse or restructuring of the gold\u2013ceria interfacial perimeters. To date, a detailed atomic-level insight into the restructuring of the active gold\u2013ceria interfaces is still lacking. Here, we report that gold particles of 2\u20134 nm size, strongly anchored onto rod-shaped CeO2, are not only highly active but also distinctively stable under realistic reaction conditions. Environmental transmission electron microscopy analyses identified that the gold nanoparticles, in response to alternating oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, changed their shapes but did not sinter at temperatures up to 573 K. This finding offers a new strategy to stabilize gold nanoparticles on ceria by engineering the gold\u2013ceria interfacial structure, which could be extended to other \u2026"
