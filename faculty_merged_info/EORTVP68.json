                "Contact electrification of dielectric grains forms the basis for a myriad of physical phenomena. However, even the basic aspects of collisional charging between grains are still unclear. Here, we develop a new experimental method, based on acoustic levitation, which allows us to controllably and repeatedly collide two sub-millimeter grains and measure the evolution of their electric charges. This is, therefore, the first tribocharging experiment to provide complete electric isolation for the grain\u2013grain system from its surroundings. We use this method to measure collisional charging rates between pairs of grains for three different material combinations: polyethylene\u2013polyethylene, polystyrene\u2013polystyrene, and polystyrene\u2013sulfonated polystyrene. The ability to directly and noninvasively collide particles of different constituent materials, chemical functionality, size, and shape opens the door to detailed studies of collisional \u2026"
