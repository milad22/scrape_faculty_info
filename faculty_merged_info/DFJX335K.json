                "We present a map and an angular power spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the first flight of the Millimeter\u2010wave Anisotropy Experiment Imaging Array (MAXIMA). MAXIMA is a balloon\u2010borne experiment with an array of 16 bolometric photometers operated at 100 mK. MAXIMA observed a 124 deg2 region of the sky with 10  resolution at frequencies of 150, 240, and 410 GHz. The data were calibrated using in\u2010flight measurements of the CMB dipole anisotropy. A map of the CMB anisotropy was produced from three 150 and one 240 GHz photometer without need for foreground subtractions. Analysis of this CMB map yields a power spectrum for the CMB anisotropy over the range  . The spectrum shows a peak with an amplitude of   \u03bcK at   and an amplitude varying between \u223c40 and \u223c50 \u03bcK for  ."
