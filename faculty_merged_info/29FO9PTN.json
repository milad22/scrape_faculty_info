Our optical methods include ultrafast spectroscopy on femtosecond and picosecond time scales, single photon counting and correlation, real-space and momentum space (Fourier) imaging with CCD cameras, and nonlinear optics such as two-photon absorption and the optical Stark effect. We can also apply variable stress to samples to create potential gradients to move particles inside solids, vary temperature down to cryogenic temperatures, and measure transport with electronics.  One of the main efforts in our lab at present in the study of polariton condensates in microcavities. The polaritons are essentially photons dressed with an effective mass and strong interactions due to the special design of the solid-state microcavity structures we use. These interacting photons can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, which is a state of matter with spontaneous coherence. We can see superfluid flow of the polariton condensate over millimeter distances; we can also trap the condensate in various potentials; and we can see interference due to the coherence of the condensate.  This work connects to several fundamental questions. One topic is how coherence can occur spontaneously\u00a0(\"enphasing\")\u00a0in systems like lasers and condensates and how coherence is lost (\"dephasing\") in standard quantum systems. \u00a0This, in turn, relates to the deep question of why there is irreversibility in nature, that is, the arrow of time. Another topic is how phase transitions can occur in\u00a0nonequilibrium systems. We have developed sophisticated numerical methods to compare\u00a0\u00a0the solution of a quantum Boltzmann equation (which gives the temporal evolution of a system in nonequilibrium) to\u00a0our data on the momentum and energy distributions of gases of various particles.  A new effort in our group is looking at the effect of a polariton condensate on electronic transport. This may allow a \"light-induced superconductor\", in which there are dramatic effects on conduction when the polariton condensate appears. We are also looking at new material systems so that the polariton codnensate effects can be moved to room temperature.
