                "The Double Chooz experiment presents an indication of reactor electron antineutrino disappearance consistent with neutrino oscillations. An observed-to-predicted ratio of events of 0.944\u00b10.016 (stat)\u00b10.040 (syst) was obtained in 101 days of running at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France, with two 4.25 GW th reactors. The results were obtained from a single 10 m 3 fiducial volume detector located 1050 m from the two reactor cores. The reactor antineutrino flux prediction used the Bugey4 flux measurement after correction for differences in core composition. The deficit can be interpreted as an indication of a nonzero value of the still unmeasured neutrino mixing parameter sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13. Analyzing both the rate of the prompt positrons and their energy spectrum, we find sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.086\u00b10.041 (stat)\u00b10.030 (syst), or, at 90% CL, 0.017< sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13< 0.16.",
                "We report on a search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of Xe 136 with EXO-200. No signal is observed for an exposure of 32.5 kg yr, with a background of\u223c 1.5\u00d7 10\u2212 3 kg\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 keV\u2212 1 in the\u00b11 \u03c3 region of interest. This sets a lower limit on the half-life of the neutrinoless double-beta decay T 1\/2 0 \u03bd \u03b2 \u03b2 (Xe 136)> 1.6\u00d7 10 25 yr (90% CL), corresponding to effective Majorana masses of less than 140\u2013380 meV, depending on the matrix element calculation.",
                "The Double Chooz experiment has observed 8249 candidate electron antineutrino events in 227.93 live days with 33.71 GW-ton-years (reactor power\u00d7 detector mass\u00d7 live time) exposure using a 10.3 m 3 fiducial volume detector located at 1050 m from the reactor cores of the Chooz nuclear power plant in France. The expectation in case of \u03b8 13= 0 is 8937 events. The deficit is interpreted as evidence of electron antineutrino disappearance. From a rate plus spectral shape analysis we find sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.109\u00b10.030 (stat)\u00b10.025 (syst). The data exclude the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% CL (2.9 \u03c3)."

This decay is forbidden in the Standard Model due to violation of the lepton number conservation. If observed, it would provide information about the neutrino mass scale and prove that neutrinos are their own anti-particles. Dr. Ostrovskiy is also involved in the search for the magnetic monopoles. These hypothetical particles were suggested to exist by Dirac to explain quantization of the electric charge. Magnetic monopoles are also predicted in many variants of the Grand Unification Theory (GUT) and in Supersymmetric (SUSY) models. He participates in the MoEDAL experiment \u2013 a dedicated magnetic monopole search at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN, Switzerland.\u00a0 Dr. Ostrovskiy is also developing a magnetic monopole detector to be deployed in the Low Earth Orbit using CubeSats.  Dr. Ostrovskiy received his PhD from the University of Alabama in 2011. He was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford from 2012 to 2016. He joined the faculty of the University of Alabama in 2016.
