                "LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 are insulating, non-magnetic oxides, yet the interface between them exhibits a two-dimensional electron system with high electron mobility 1, superconductivity at low temperatures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and electric-field-tuned metal\u2013insulator and superconductor\u2013insulator phase transitions 3, 6, 7, 8. Bulk magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements also indicate some form of magnetism depending on preparation conditions 5, 9, 10, 11 and a tendency towards nanoscale electronic phase separation 10. Here we use local imaging of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility to directly observe a landscape of ferromagnetism, paramagnetism and superconductivity. We find submicrometre patches of ferromagnetism in a uniform background of paramagnetism, with a non-uniform, weak diamagnetic superconducting susceptibility at low temperature. These results demonstrate the existence of \u2026",
                "The magnetic field dependence of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N (E F, H), is determined in single-crystal Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 by specific heat measurements. The total specific heat is best described by including two predictions for the electronic specific heat of d-wave superconductivity: a T 2 term in zero field and an increased linear term in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Cu O 2 planes. The additional linear term, which implies a finite N (E F, H), obeys N (E F, H)\u221d(H H c 2) 1 2 as predicted by Volovik for superconductivity with lines of nodes in the gap.",
                "Stimulated Raman transitions between the ground-level hyperfine states of atoms have been used to manipulate slowly moving atoms in an atomic fountain. An ensemble of sodium atoms with an inferred velocity spread along one dimension of 270 \u03bcm\/sec has been prepared by this technique. We also show that this velocity-selection method is effective in measuring ultracold temperatures of laser-cooled atoms in a regime where traditional ballistic methods fail.",
                "This paper analyzes the use of Raman transitions to select a narrow velocity distribution of atoms. We determine the evolution of the atomic wave function comprised of both the internal state and the external momentum of the atom in the presence of two counterpropagating laser beams. The effects of a single \u03c0 pulse, two separated Ramsey \u03c0\/2 pulses, and a sequence of four \u03c0\/2 pulses are analyzed.",
                "We have used a high-resolution scanning SQUID microscope to directly image conventional (h\/2 e) Josephson vortices trapped in grain boundaries, and half-integer (h\/4 e) Josephson vortices trapped at the tricrystal point, of the high-T c superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 grown on tricrystal substrates of SrTi O 3. Our observation of the half-integer vortex at the tricrystal point is the first direct demonstration of the positive paramagnetic Meissner effect in a polycrystalline high-T c film. In addition, our images provide the first direct measurement of the Josephson penetration depth.",
                "The quantum spin Hall (QSH) state is a state of matter characterized by a non-trivial topology of its band structure, and associated conducting edge channels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The QSH state was predicted 6 and experimentally demonstrated 7 to be realized in HgTe quantum wells. The existence of the edge channels has been inferred from local and non-local transport measurements in sufficiently small devices 7, 8, 9. Here we directly confirm the existence of the edge channels by imaging the magnetic fields produced by current flowing in large Hall bars made from HgTe quantum wells. These images distinguish between current that passes through each edge and the bulk. On tuning the bulk conductivity by gating or raising the temperature, we observe a regime in which the edge channels clearly coexist with the conducting bulk, providing input to the question of how ballistic transport may be limited in the edge \u2026",
                "A new scheme has been developed that produces a slow atomic beam of high brightness with a narrow velocity distribution. The technique can provide long measurement times and high counting rates for future precision experiments. In our initial work, densities of 10 8 Na atoms\/cm 3 at a velocity of 270 cm\/sec and at a temperature of\u223c 200 \u03bcK were obtained.",
                "It is widely believed that the perovskite Sr 2 Ru O 4 is an unconventional superconductor with broken time-reversal symmetry. It has been predicted that superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry should have spontaneously generated supercurrents at edges and domain walls. We have done careful imaging of the magnetic fields above Sr 2 Ru O 4 single crystals using scanning Hall bar and superconducting quantum interference device microscopies, and see no evidence for such spontaneously generated supercurrents. We use the results from our magnetic imaging to place upper limits on the spontaneously generated supercurrents at edges and domain walls as a function of domain size. For a single domain, this upper limit is below the predicted signal by 2 orders of magnitude. We speculate on the causes and implications of the lack of large spontaneous supercurrents in this very interesting \u2026",
                "Using scanning SQUID microscopy, we have directly imaged spontaneously generated delocalized magnetic flux in 45 [001] tilt grain boundaries in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x films. Implications for the transport properties of the grain boundaries are discussed. A model based on a d x 2\u2212 y 2-wave symmetry component of the superconducting order parameter and on grain-boundary faceting is consistent with the results of our experiments.",
                "The authors have measured the magnetic response of 33 individual cold mesoscopic gold rings, one ring at a time. The response of some sufficiently small rings has a component that is periodic in the flux through the ring and is attributed to a persistent current. Its period is close to h\/e, and its sign and amplitude vary between rings. The amplitude distribution agrees well with predictions for the typical h\/e current in diffusive rings. The temperature dependence of the amplitude, measured for four rings, is also consistent with theory. These results disagree with previous measurements of three individual metal rings that showed a much larger periodic response than expected. The use of a scanning SQUID microscope enabled in situ measurements of the sensor background. A paramagnetic linear susceptibility and a poorly understood anomaly around a zero field are attributed to defect spins."
