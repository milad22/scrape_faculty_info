Bulk magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements also indicate some form of magnetism depending on preparation conditions 5, 9, 10, 11 and a tendency towards nanoscale electronic phase separation 10. Here we use local imaging of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility to directly observe a landscape of ferromagnetism, paramagnetism and superconductivity. We find submicrometre patches of ferromagnetism in a uniform background of paramagnetism, with a non-uniform, weak diamagnetic superconducting susceptibility at low temperature.

                "The magnetic field dependence of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N (E F, H), is determined in single-crystal Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 by specific heat measurements. The total specific heat is best described by including two predictions for the electronic specific heat of d-wave superconductivity: a T 2 term in zero field and an increased linear term in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Cu O 2 planes. The additional linear term, which implies a finite N (E F, H), obeys N (E F, H)\u221d(H H c 2) 1 2 as predicted by Volovik for superconductivity with lines of nodes in the gap.",
                "Stimulated Raman transitions between the ground-level hyperfine states of atoms have been used to manipulate slowly moving atoms in an atomic fountain. An ensemble of sodium atoms with an inferred velocity spread along one dimension of 270 \u03bcm\/sec has been prepared by this technique.

                "The quantum spin Hall (QSH) state is a state of matter characterized by a non-trivial topology of its band structure, and associated conducting edge channels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The QSH state was predicted 6 and experimentally demonstrated 7 to be realized in HgTe quantum wells. The existence of the edge channels has been inferred from local and non-local transport measurements in sufficiently small devices 7, 8, 9. Here we directly confirm the existence of the edge channels by imaging the magnetic fields produced by current flowing in large Hall bars made from HgTe quantum wells. These images distinguish between current that passes through each edge and the bulk. On tuning the bulk conductivity by gating or raising the temperature, we observe a regime in which the edge channels clearly coexist with the conducting bulk, providing input to the question of how ballistic transport may be limited in the edge \u2026",

                "It is widely believed that the perovskite Sr 2 Ru O 4 is an unconventional superconductor with broken time-reversal symmetry. It has been predicted that superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry should have spontaneously generated supercurrents at edges and domain walls. We have done careful imaging of the magnetic fields above Sr 2 Ru O 4 single crystals using scanning Hall bar and superconducting quantum interference device microscopies, and see no evidence for such spontaneously generated supercurrents. We use the results from our magnetic imaging to place upper limits on the spontaneously generated supercurrents at edges and domain walls as a function of domain size. For a single domain, this upper limit is below the predicted signal by 2 orders of magnitude. We speculate on the causes and implications of the lack of large spontaneous supercurrents in this very interesting \u2026",

Implications for the transport properties of the grain boundaries are discussed. A model based on a d x 2\u2212 y 2-wave symmetry component of the superconducting order parameter and on grain-boundary faceting is consistent with the results of our experiments.",
                "The authors have measured the magnetic response of 33 individual cold mesoscopic gold rings, one ring at a time. The response of some sufficiently small rings has a component that is periodic in the flux through the ring and is attributed to a persistent current. Its period is close to h\/e, and its sign and amplitude vary between rings. The amplitude distribution agrees well with predictions for the typical h\/e current in diffusive rings. The temperature dependence of the amplitude, measured for four rings, is also consistent with theory. These results disagree with previous measurements of three individual metal rings that showed a much larger periodic response than expected. The use of a scanning SQUID microscope enabled in situ measurements of the sensor background. A paramagnetic linear susceptibility and a poorly understood anomaly around a zero field are attributed to defect spins."

We mount a SQUID microscope on the 3 K plate of a Bluefors cryocooler and characterize its vibration spectrum by measuring SQUID noise in a region of sharp flux gradient. By implementing passive vibration isolation, we reduce relative sensor-sample vibrations to 20 nm in-plane and 15 nm out-of-plane. A variable-temperature sample stage that is thermally isolated from the SQUID sensor enables the measurement at sample temperatures from 2.8 K to 110 K. We demonstrate these advances by imaging inhomogeneous diamagnetic susceptibility and vortex pinning in optimally doped yttrium barium copper oxide above 90 K.

A. 88 (8) : 083703 Scanning Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy provides valuable information about magnetic properties of materials and devices. The magnetic flux response of the SQUID is often linearized with a flux-locked feedback loop, which limits the response time to microseconds or longer. In this work, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a novel scanning SQUID sampler with a 40-ps time resolution and linearized response to periodically triggered signals. Other design features include a micron-scale pickup loop for the detection of local magnetic flux, a field coil to apply a local magnetic field to the sample, and a modulation coil to operate the SQUID sampler in a flux-locked loop to linearize the flux response. The entire sampler device is fabricated on a 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm chip and can be scanned over macroscopic planar samples. The flux noise at 4.2 K with 100 kHz repetition rate and 1 s of averaging is of order 1 m\u03a60. This SQUID sampler will be useful for imaging dynamics in magnetic and superconducting materials and devices.

R., Kratz, P. A., Kirtley, J. R., Moler, K., Adams, P. W., MacDonald, A. H., Shih, C. 113 (38) : 10513-10517 We report on a study of epitaxially grown ultrathin Pb films that are only a few atoms thick and have parallel critical magnetic fields much higher than the expected limit set by the interaction of electron spins with a magnetic field, that is, the Clogston-Chandrasekhar limit. The epitaxial thin films are classified as dirty-limit superconductors because their mean-free paths, which are limited by surface scattering, are smaller than their superconducting coherence lengths. The uniformity of superconductivity in these thin films is established by comparing scanning tunneling spectroscopy, scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, double-coil mutual inductance, and magneto-transport, data that provide average superfluid rigidity on length scales covering the range from microscopic to macroscopic. We argue that the survival of superconductivity at Zeeman energies much larger than the superconducting gap can be understood only as the consequence of strong spin-orbit coupling that, together with substrate-induced inversion-symmetry breaking, produces spin splitting in the normal-state energy bands that is much larger than the superconductor's energy gap.

J., Palmstrom, J. C., Holland, C. M., Spanton, E. M., Schiessl, D., Jermain, C. L., Gibbons, J., Fung, Y. K., Huber, M. E., Ralph, D. C., Ketchen, M. B., Gibson, G. W., Moler, K. A. 87 (9) Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy has excellent magnetic field sensitivity, but suffers from modest spatial resolution when compared with other scanning probes. This spatial resolution is determined by both the size of the field sensitive area and the spacing between this area and the sample surface. In this paper we describe scanning SQUID susceptometers that achieve sub-micron spatial resolution while retaining a white noise floor flux sensitivity of \u22482\u03bc\u03a60\/Hz(1\/2). This high spatial resolution is accomplished by deep sub-micron feature sizes, well shielded pickup loops fabricated using a planarized process, and a deep etch step that minimizes the spacing between the sample surface and the SQUID pickup loop. We describe the design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of these sensors. Although sub-micron spatial resolution has been achieved previously in scanning SQUID sensors, our sensors not only achieve high spatial resolution but also have integrated modulation coils for flux feedback, integrated field coils for susceptibility measurements, and batch processing. They are therefore a generally applicable tool for imaging sample magnetization, currents, and susceptibilities with higher spatial resolution than previous susceptometers.

D., Bonetti, S., Ohldag, H., Banerjee, N., Wang, X. L., Rosenberg, A. J., Cai, Z., Zhao, J. H., Moler, K. A., Robinson, J. W. 6 Thin film magnetic heterostructures with competing interfacial coupling and Zeeman energy provide a fertile ground to study phase transition between different equilibrium states as a function of external magnetic field and temperature. A rare-earth (RE)\/transition metal (TM) ferromagnetic multilayer is a classic example where the magnetic state is determined by a competition between the Zeeman energy and antiferromagnetic interfacial exchange coupling energy. Technologically, such structures offer the possibility to engineer the macroscopic magnetic response by tuning the microscopic interactions between the layers. We have performed an exhaustive study of nickel\/gadolinium as a model system for understanding RE\/TM multilayers using the element-specific measurement technique x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and determined the full magnetic state diagrams as a function of temperature and magnetic layer thickness. We compare our results to a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth-based model and provide evidence of a thickness-dependent transition to a magnetic fan state which is critical in understanding magnetoresistance effects in RE\/TM systems. The results provide important insight for spintronics and superconducting spintronics where engineering tunable magnetic inhomogeneity is key for certain applications.

The skewness indicates that the Josephson current is predominantly carried by Andreev bound states with high transmittance, and the fact that the skewness persists in junctions that are longer than the mean free path suggests that the effect may be related to the helical nature of the Andreev bound states in the surface of HgTe. These experimental results suggest that the topological properties of the normal state can be inherited by the induced superconducting state, and that 3D HgTe is a promising material for realizing the many exciting proposals that require a topological superconductor.

A. 113 (2) : 026804-? Quantum spin Hall devices with edges much longer than several microns do not display ballistic transport; that is, their measured conductances are much less than e^{2}\/h per edge. We imaged edge currents in InAs\/GaSb quantum wells with long edges and determined an effective edge resistance. Surprisingly, although the effective edge resistance is much greater than h\/e^{2}, it is independent of temperature up to 30\u00a0K within experimental resolution. Known candidate scattering mechanisms do not explain our observation of an effective edge resistance that is large yet temperature independent. PubMedID 25062220 Direct measurement of internal magnetic fields in natural sands using scanning SQUID microscopy. Journal of magnetic resonance Walbrecker, J. O., Kalisky, B., Grombacher, D., Kirtley, J., Moler, K. A., Knight, R. 242 : 10-17 NMR experiments are ideally carried out in well-controlled magnetic fields. When samples of natural porous materials are studied, the situation can be complicated if the sample itself contains magnetic components, giving rise to internal magnetic fields in the pore space that modulate the externally applied fields. If not properly accounted for, the internal fields can lead to misinterpretation of relaxation, diffusion, or imaging data. To predict the potential effect of internal fields, and develop effective mitigation strategies, it is important to develop a quantitative understanding of the magnitude and distribution of internal fields occurring in natural porous media. To develop such understanding, we employ scanning SQUID microscopy, a technique that can detect magnetic field variations very accurately at high spatial resolution (\u223c3\u03bcm). We prepared samples from natural unconsolidated aquifer material, and scanned areas of about 200\u00d7200\u03bcm in a very low background magnetic field of \u223c2\u03bcT. We found large amplitude variations with a magnitude of about 2mT, across a relatively long spatial scale of about 200\u03bcm, that are associated with a large magnetic grain (>50\u03bcm radius) with a strong magnetic remanence. We also detected substantial variations exceeding 60\u03bcT on small spatial scales of about \u223c10\u03bcm. We attribute these small-scale variations to very fine-grained magnetic material. Because we made our measurements at very low background field, the observed variations are not induced by the background field but due to magnetic remanence. Consequently, the observed internal fields will affect even low-field NMR experiments.

A. 12 (12) : 1091-1095 The ability to control materials properties through interface engineering is demonstrated by the appearance of conductivity at the interface of certain insulators, most famously the {001} interface of the band insulators LaAlO3 and TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (STO; refs\u00a0, ). Transport and other measurements in this system show a plethora of diverse physical phenomena. To better understand the interface conductivity, we used scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy to image the magnetic field locally generated by current in an interface. At low temperature, we found that the current flowed in conductive narrow paths oriented along the crystallographic axes, embedded in a less conductive background. The configuration of these paths changed on thermal cycling above the STO cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition temperature, implying that the local conductivity is strongly modified by the STO tetragonal domain structure. The interplay between substrate domains and the interface provides an additional mechanism for understanding and controlling the behaviour of heterostructures.

The QSH state was predicted and experimentally demonstrated to be realized in HgTe quantum wells. The existence of the edge channels has been inferred from local and non-local transport measurements in sufficiently small devices. Here we directly confirm the existence of the edge channels by imaging the magnetic fields produced by current flowing in large Hall bars made from HgTe quantum wells. These images distinguish between current that passes through each edge and the bulk. On tuning the bulk conductivity by gating or raising the temperature, we observe a regime in which the edge channels clearly coexist with the conducting bulk, providing input to the question of how ballistic transport may be limited in the edge channels. Our results represent a versatile method for characterization of new QSH materials systems.

In this work, we demonstrate that the small ferromagnetic patches in LaAlO(3)\/SrTiO(3) heterostructures can be dramatically changed by in situ contact of a scanning probe. Our results provide a platform for manipulation of small magnets through either a strong magneto-elastic coupling or sensitivity to surface modification. The ability to locally control magnetism is particularly interesting due to the presence of superconductivity with strong spin-orbit coupling in LaAlO(3)\/SrTiO(3).

A. 3 In LaAlO(3)\/SrTiO(3) heterointerfaces, charge carriers migrate from the LaAlO(3) to the interface in an electronic reconstruction. Magnetism has been observed in LaAlO(3)\/SrTiO(3), but its relationship to the interface conductivity is unknown. Here we show that reconstruction is necessary, but not sufficient, for the formation of magnetism. Using scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy we find that magnetism appears only above a critical LaAlO(3) thickness, similar to the conductivity. We observe no change in ferromagnetism with gate voltage, and detect ferromagnetism in a non-conducting p-type sample. These observations indicate that the carriers at the interface do not need to be itinerant to generate magnetism. The ferromagnetism appears in isolated patches whose density varies greatly between samples. This inhomogeneity strongly suggests that disorder or local strain generates magnetism in a population of the interface carriers.

The superfluid density \u03c1s(T) \u2261 1\/\u03bbab(T)2 has three main features. First, \u03c1s (T = 0) falls sharply on the underdoped side of the dome. Second, \u03bbab(T) is flat at low T at optimal doping, indicating fully gapped superconductivity, but varies more strongly in underdoped and overdoped samples, consistent with either a power law or a small second gap. Third, \u03c1s (T) varies steeply near Tc for optimal and underdoping. These observations are consistent with an interplay between magnetic and superconducting phases.

A. 103 (12) We measure changes in the penetration depth lambda of the T_{c} approximately 6 K superconductor LaFePO. In the process, scanning SQUID susceptometry is demonstrated as a technique for accurately measuring local temperature-dependent changes in lambda, ideal for studying early or difficult-to-grow materials. lambda is found to vary linearly with temperatures from 0.36 to approximately 2 K, with a slope of 143 +\/- 15 A\/K, suggesting line nodes in the superconducting order parameter. The linear dependence up to approximately T_{c}\/3, similar to the cuprate superconductors, indicates well-developed nodes.

A., Koshnick, N. C., Huber, M. E., Moler, K. A. 103 (2) Susceptibility measurements of patterned thin films at sub-K temperatures were carried out using a scanning SQUID microscope that can resolve signals corresponding to a few hundred Bohr magnetons. Several metallic and insulating thin films, even oxide-free Au films, show a paramagnetic response with a temperature dependence that indicates unpaired spins as the origin. The observed response exhibits a measurable out-of-phase component, which implies that these spins will create 1\/f-like magnetic noise. The measured spin density is consistent with recent explanations of low frequency flux noise in SQUIDs and superconducting qubits in terms of spin fluctuations, and suggests that such unexpected spins may be even more ubiquitous than already indicated by earlier measurements. Our measurements set several constraints on the nature of these spins.

A. 102 (13) The authors have measured the magnetic response of 33 individual cold mesoscopic gold rings, one ring at a time. The response of some sufficiently small rings has a component that is periodic in the flux through the ring and is attributed to a persistent current. Its period is close to h\/e, and its sign and amplitude vary between rings. The amplitude distribution agrees well with predictions for the typical h\/e current in diffusive rings. The temperature dependence of the amplitude, measured for four rings, is also consistent with theory. These results disagree with previous measurements of three individual metal rings that showed a much larger periodic response than expected. The use of a scanning SQUID microscope enabled in situ measurements of the sensor background. A paramagnetic linear susceptibility and a poorly understood anomaly around a zero field are attributed to defect spins.

A. 79 (5) We have fabricated and characterized micro-SQUID susceptometers for use in low-temperature scanning probe microscopy systems. The design features the following: a 4.6 mum diameter pickup loop; an integrated field coil to apply a local field to the sample; an additional counterwound pickup-loop\/field-coil pair to cancel the background signal from the applied field in the absence of the sample; modulation coils to allow setting the SQUID at its optimum bias point (independent of the applied field), and shielding and symmetry that minimizes coupling of magnetic fields into the leads and body of the SQUID. We use a SQUID series array preamplifier to obtain a system bandwidth of 1 MHz. The flux noise at 125 mK is approximately 0.25 mu Phi 0\/ sqrt Hz above 10 kHz, with a value of 2.5 mu Phi 0\/ sqrt Hz at 10 Hz. The nominal sensitivity to electron spins located at the center of the pickup loop is approximately 200 muB\/ sqrt Hz above 10 kHz, in the white-noise frequency region.

A. 79 (1) The authors designed, implemented, and tested cryogenic rf filters with zero dc resistance, based on wires with a superconducting core inside a resistive sheath. The superconducting core allows low frequency currents to pass with negligible dissipation. Signals above the cutoff frequency are dissipated in the resistive part due to their small skin depth. The filters consist of twisted wire pairs shielded with copper tape. Above approximately 1 GHz, the attenuation is exponential in omega, as typical for skin depth based rf filters. By using additional capacitors of 10 nF per line, an attenuation of at least 45 dB above 10 MHz can be obtained. Thus, one single filter stage kept at mixing chamber temperature in a dilution refrigerator is sufficient to attenuate room temperature black body radiation to levels corresponding to 10 mK above about 10 MHz.

A. 318 (5855) : 1440-1443 Fluctuations are important near phase transitions, where they can be difficult to describe quantitatively. Superconductivity in mesoscopic rings is particularly intriguing because the critical temperature is an oscillatory function of magnetic field. There is an exact theory for thermal fluctuations in one-dimensional superconducting rings, which are therefore expected to be an excellent model system. We measured the susceptibility of many rings, one ring at a time, by using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device that can isolate magnetic signals that are seven orders of magnitude smaller than applied flux. We find that the fluctuation theory describes the results and that a single parameter characterizes the ways in which the fluctuations are especially important at magnetic fields where the critical temperature is suppressed.

R., Deng, Z., Luan, L., Yenilmez, E., Dai, H., Moler, K. A. 18 (46) Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using metal-coated carbon nanotube tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions (Deng et al 2004 Appl. Phys. Lett. 85 6263). Here we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.

C., Huber, M. E., Moler, K. A. 97 (23) The magnetic response and fluxoid transitions of superconducting aluminum rings of various sizes, deposited under conditions likely to generate a layered structure, show good agreement with a two-order-parameter Ginzburg-Landau model. For intermediate couplings, we find metastable states that have different phase winding numbers around the ring in each of the two order parameters. Those states, previously theoretically predicted, are analogous to fractional vortices in singly connected samples with two-order-parameter superconductivity. Larger coupling locks the relative phase so that the two order parameters are only manifest in the temperature dependence of the response. With increasing proximitization, this signature gradually disappears.

W., Lin, Y. J., Liang, R., Hardy, W. N., Kirtley, J. R., Moler, K. A. 414 (6866) : 887-889 There is a long-standing debate about whether spin-charge separation is the root cause of the peculiar normal-state properties and high superconducting transition temperatures of the high-Tc materials. In the proposed state of matter, the elementary excitations are not electron-like, as in conventional metals, but rather the electron 'fractionalizes' to give excitations that are chargeless spin-1\/2 fermions (spinons) and charge +e bosons (chargons). Although spin-charge separation has been well established in one dimension, the theoretical situation for two dimensions is controversial and experimental evidence for it in the high-Tc materials is indirect. A model with sharp experimental tests for a particular type of separation in two dimensions has recently been proposed. Here we report the results of those experimental tests, placing a conservative upper limit of 190 K on the energy of the proposed topological defects known as visons. There is still debate about the extent to which this experiment can settle the issue of spin-charge separation in the high-Tc copper oxides, because some forms of the separation are able to avoid the need for visons. But at least one class of theories that all predict a vortex-memory effect now are unlikely models for the copper oxides. Web of Science ID 000172813300039 PubMedID 11780056 Limits on spin-charge separation from h\/2e fluxoids in very underdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x Wynn, J. C., Bonn, D. A., Gardner, B. W., Lin, Y. J., Liang, R. X., Hardy, W. N., Kirtley, J. R., Moler, K. A. 87 (19) Magnetic flux in superconductors is usually quantized in units of h\/2e. Here we report scanning SQUID and scanning Hall probe studies of single fluxoids in high purity YBa2Cu3O6.35 crystals (T(c) less, similar 13 K), extending flux quantization studies to a region of the cuprate phase diagram where the superfluid density is sufficiently low that novel behavior has been predicted. Some scenarios in which superconductivity results from spin-charge separation predict h\/e fluxoids in materials with low superfluid density. Our observations of only h\/2e fluxoids set limits on these theories.

A. 285 (5432) : 1373\u201375 The temperature dependence of the half-integer magnetic flux quantum effect in thin-film tricrystal samples of the high-critical-temperature cuprate superconductor YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) was measured and found to persist from a temperature of 0.5 kelvin through a critical temperature of about 90 kelvin, with no change in total flux. This result implies that d-wave symmetry pairing predominates in this cuprate, with a small component of time-reversal symmetry breaking, if any, over the entire temperature range.

News: Stanford researchers create exotic electrons that may lead to new materials, devices Research in experimental condensed matter physics at Stanford takes place in the Physics and Applied Physics Departments and has strong connections with the Photon Science Department at the National Accelerator Laboratory. A broad set of topics are explored in the Varian Physics Laboratory, Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials and through the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Science A large community of physicists at Stanford address questions in condensed matter physics and materials science.\u00a0 How do electrons organize themselves and flow on the nanoscale? This is addressed with nanofabrication, materials growth, precision low-temperature electrical measurements, and novel scanning probe techniques. Other efforts address emerging phases and quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems, highlighting time-reversal and inversion symmetry breaking, charge and spin ordering and their competition with magnetism and superconductivity. Condensed-matter techniques are used for precision measurements of fundamental physics such as Newton's gravity at sub-mm length scales. Other research addresses emerging phenomena in quantum solids: high-temperature superconductivity, excitations in low-dimensional compounds, quantum-phase transitions, novel spin-orbit physics, heavy fermions, charge-density waves, magnetoresistive materials, metal-insulator transitions, organic conductors and superconductors.\u00a0 These experiments rely on various forms of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy: spatial, spin and time-resolved, inelastic x-ray scattering, and soft x-ray emmision spectroscopy. Efforts at the intersection of condensed matter physics and nanoscale science and technology use scanning probe instruments to do quantum imaging and manipulation of matter on length scales now approaching the femtometer; work is this area addresses single atoms, molecules, electrons, spins, vibrons, and quantum phases.
