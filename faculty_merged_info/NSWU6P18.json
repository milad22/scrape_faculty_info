                "We present Se 77-NMR measurements on FeSe 1\u2212 x S x samples with sulfur content x= 0%, 9%, 15%, and 29%. Twinned nematic domains are observed in the NMR spectrum for all samples except x= 29%. The NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate shows that antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations are initially enhanced between x= 0% and x= 9%, but are strongly suppressed for higher x values. The observed behavior of the AFM fluctuations parallels the superconducting transition temperature T c in these materials, providing strong evidence for the primary importance of AFM fluctuations for superconductivity, despite the presence of nematic quantum criticality in the FeSe 1\u2212 x S x system.",
                "As 75 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements have been carried out to investigate the magnetic and electronic properties of the filled skutterudite metallic compound SrFe 4 As 12. The temperature dependence of Knight shift K determined by the NQR spectrum under a small magnetic field (\u2264 0.5 T) shows the similar temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 which exhibits a broad maximum at T*\u223c 50 K. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1\/T 1 T increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a broad maximum at T\u223c 70 K, similar to the case of \u03c7. The temperature dependence of K and 1\/T 1 T is reasonably explained by a simple model where we assume a concave-shaped band structure near the Fermi energy. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the T 1 and K data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found \u2026",
                "We present self flux growth and characterization of single crystalline AlMn 2 B 2. It is an orthorhombic (space group C m m m), layered material with a platelike morphology. The anisotropic bulk magnetization data, electrical transport, and B 11 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data revealed an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at 313\u00b12 K. In the magnetization data, there is also a broad local maximum significantly above the AFM transition that could be a signature of low-dimensional magnetic interactions in AlMn 2 B 2.",
                "The sulfur-substituted FeSe system, FeSe 1\u2212 x S x, provides a versatile platform for studying the relationship among nematicity, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity. Here, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and resistivity measurements up to 4.73 GPa on FeSe 0.91 S 0.09, we established the pressure-(p-) temperature (T) phase diagram in which the nematic state is suppressed with pressure showing a nematic quantum phase transition (QPT) around p= 0.5 GPa, two superconductivity (SC) regions separated by the QPT appear, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase emerges above\u223c 3.3 GPa. From the NMR results up to 2.1 GPa, AFM fluctuations are revealed to be characterized by the stripe-type wave vector which remains the same for the two SC regions. Furthermore, the electronic state is found to change in character from non-Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid around the nematic QPT and persists up to\u223c 2.1 \u2026"
