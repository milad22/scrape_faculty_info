                "The physical properties of GaSb are briefly presented and the device implications reviewed. GaSb is a direct gap semiconductor (0.72 eV) capable of being doped either p or n type with good mobilities and it has significant electro-optical potential in the near IR range. As a substrate, or active layer, GaSb can be employed in conjunction with many semiconductors such as (AlGa)Sb or In(AsSb) and has interesting heterojunction potential for detectors and lasers and quantum well structures.",
                "Au and Ag Schottky contacts on the epiready (0001)Zn surface of bulk n-ZnO crystals show Schottky barrier heights of 0.65\u20130.70 eV from capacitance\u2013voltage measurements, activation energies for reverse saturation currents of 0.3\u20130.4 eV and saturation current densities ranging from 10\u22125\u2009A\u200acm\u22122 on surfaces etched in HCl to 8\u00d710\u22127\u2009A\u200acm\u22122 on solvent cleaned samples. The diode ideality factors were in the range 1.6\u20131.8 under all conditions. The properties of both the Au and the Ag Schottky diodes were degraded by heating in vacuum to temperatures even as low as 365 K. The degradation mechanisms during annealing were different in each case, with the Au showing reaction with the ZnO surface and the Ag contacts showing localized delamination. Mechanical polishing of the ZnO surface prior to contact deposition produced a high-resistivity damaged layer with prominent deep level defects present with \u2026",
                "Low-injection minority carrier lifetimes (MCLs) and deep trap spectra have been investigated in n\u2212 4H-SiC epilayers of varying layer thicknesses, in order to enable the separation of bulk lifetimes from surface recombination effects. From the linear dependence of the inverse bulk MCL on the concentration of Z1\u2215Z2 defects and from the behavior of the deep trap spectra in 4H-SiC p-i-n diodes under forward bias, we conclude that it is Z1\u2215Z2 alone that controls the MCL in this material.",
                "A review of the effects of proton, neutron, \u03b3-ray, and electron irradiation on GaN materials and devices is presented. Neutron irradiation tends to create disordered regions in the GaN, while the damage from the other forms of radiation is more typically point defects. In all cases, the damaged region contains carrier traps that reduce the mobility and conductivity of the GaN and at high enough doses, a significant degradation of device performance. GaN is several orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage than GaAs of similar doping concentrations. In terms of heterostructures, preliminary data suggests that the radiation hardness decreases in the order AlN\/GaN\u2009>\u2009AlGaN\/GaN\u2009>\u2009InAlN\/GaN, consistent with the average bond strengths in the Al-based materials.",
                "Gallium Nitride based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are attractive for use in high power and high frequency applications, with higher breakdown voltages and two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density compared to their GaAs counterparts. Specific applications for nitride HEMTs include air, land and satellite based communications and phased array radar. Highly efficient GaN-based blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) employ AlGaN and InGaN alloys with different compositions integrated into heterojunctions and quantum wells. The realization of these blue LEDs has led to white light sources, in which a blue LED is used to excite a phosphor material; light is then emitted in the yellow spectral range, which, combined with the blue light, appears as white. Alternatively, multiple LEDs of red, green and blue can be used together. Both of these technologies are used in high-efficiency white \u2026",
                "High quality GaN epilayers have been grown on oxygen and zinc surfaces of ZnO (0001) substrates by reactive molecular beam epitaxy and the effect of the intermediate buffer layer on the structural and optical properties of the GaN films has been investigated. The optical and structural characterization of the GaN epilayers and ZnO substrates were performed using photoluminescence, reflectivity, x-ray double diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The optical results indicated that GaN was grown with compressive strain due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between GaN and ZnO. The surface roughness has been reduced by using an intermediate low temperature GaN buffer layer. The low temperature photoluminescence spectra of GaN\/ZnO epilayers did not reveal any sign of the well-known midgap yellow signal. Linear polarized reflectivity and \u2026",
                "New developments in theoretical studies of defects and impurities in III-Nitrides as pertinent to compensation and recombination in these materials are discussed. New results on experimental studies on defect states of Si, O, Mg, C, Fe in GaN, InGaN, and AlGaN are surveyed. Deep electron and hole traps data reported for GaN and AlGaN are critically assessed. The role of deep defects in trapping in AlGaN\/GaN, InAlN\/GaN structures and transistors and in degradation of transistor parameters during electrical stress tests and after irradiation is discussed. The recent data on deep traps influence on luminescent efficiency and degradation of characteristics of III-Nitride light emitting devices and laser diodes are reviewed.",
                "This article reviews the effects of radiation damage on GaN materials and devices such as light-emitting diodes and high electron mobility transistors. Protons, electrons and gamma rays typically produce point defects in GaN, in contrast to neutron damage which is dominated by more extended disordered regions. Regardless of the type of radiation, the electrical conductivity of the GaN is reduced through the introduction of trap states with thermal ionization energies deep in the forbidden bandgap. An important practical parameter is the carrier removal rate for each type of radiation since this determines the dose at which device degradation will occur. Many studies have shown that GaN is several orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage than GaAs, i.e. it can withstand radiation doses of at least two orders of magnitude higher than those degrading GaAs with a similar doping level. Many issues still \u2026",
                "The behavior of Si donors was studied in AlxGa1\u2212xN films with composition 0<x<0.6. It is shown that the Si donors ionization energy increases from 18 meV for 0<x<0.1 to about 50 meV for x=0.4 and does not exceed 90 meV for x=0.6. Increase in Al composition is also accompanied by the growth of the density of defects with energy levels deeper than Si. Combined action of the two above effects leads to increased difficulty in n-type doping of AlGaN films with higher Al mole fractions. Persistent photoconductivity (PPC) is shown to be a characteristic feature of AlGaN samples of all compositions. It is shown that PPC in AlGaN is related to the presence of centers with a relatively high (0.1\u20130.2 eV) barrier for capture of electrons. In GaN and AlGaN with x<0.1 such centers are not associated with Si donors per se.",
                "It is shown that in n-GaN samples with a strong yellow luminescence band the deep levels spectra measured by optical transient current spectroscopy (OTCS) is always dominated by a hole trap at Ev+0.85 eV which is absent in the spectra of the samples with weak yellow luminescence. Based on the results of recent theoretical calculations it is suggested that these traps could be gallium vacancies VGa and that the centers responsible for yellow luminescence are formed by pairing such vacancies with shallow donors. The results indicate that the yellow luminescence band could be the dominant recombination channel in the samples with strong yellow luminescence band whereas in the samples with weak yellow luminescence recombination this role is taken over by nonradiative recombination centers. Deep levels transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements revealed the existence of a barrier for capture of \u2026"

                "Alexander  Polyakov Alexander  Polyakov Professor of Physics 609-258-4314 polyakov@Princeton.EDU Katherine  Lamos 348 Jadwin Hall Joseph Henry Professor of Physics  My main interests this year were directed towards string theory of quark confinement. The problem is to find the string Lagrangian for the Faraday's `lines of force',which would reproduce perturbative corrections from the Yang-Mills theory to the Coulomb law at small distances and would give permanent confinement of quarks at large distances. My side interests have been in the theory of turbulence and string cosmology. In the field of turbulence I have been looking for a simple model to check conformal theory of this phenomenon, which I developed 2 years ago. The model in question appears to be the Burgers turbulence (which now is in the center of interest of much of hydrodynamics community). I found for the certain type of stirring forces, an exact solution of this theory... This result is now being tested both theoretically and numerically. In cosmology I continued to work with T. Damour on the dilaton violation of the equivalence principle. We have found that S or T- dualities of string theory lead to the features, needed for consistency of our conjectures in the previous work.
