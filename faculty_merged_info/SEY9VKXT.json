                "We describe mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase gene in viruses which reactivated in two patients during therapy with \u20102\u2032\u2010deoxy\u2010 3\u2032\u2010thiacytidine, or lamivudine (3TC), and following orthotopic liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B. Virus resistance to 3TC is associated with mutations which lead to amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved tyr\u2010met\u2010asp\u2010asp (YMDD) motif, part of the active site of the polymerase, and which parallel those seen in resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Substitutions of valine and isoleucine for methionine were found in the two cases. The significance of single secondary mutations, which differ between viruses from the two patients, remains to be determined. Thus, viral resistance to lamivudine of hepatitis B virus mimics that of HIV and can occur in the setting of immunosuppression after liver transplantations.",
                "Orthotopic liver transplantation in patients positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is associated with a high reinfection rate, even with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) prophylaxis. Nucleoside analogues that inhibit hepatitis B replication in patients with chronic hepatitis B could prevent reinfection after transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy and safety of prophylaxis both before and after transplantation with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine, without HBIG, in patients undergoing liver transplantation.17 HBsAg-positive patients with decompensated cirrhosis and previous evidence of viral replication were enrolled. 12 were HBV-DNA-positive by a signal amplification assay. Patients were treated with oral lamivudine (100 mg daily) for at least 4 weeks before transplantation and followed up for 18\u201390 weeks after transplantation.HBV DNA became undetectable \u2026",

                "This study reports on an action research project carried out in two non-Japanese, U.K. manufacturing companies that were considering the establishment of a strategic supply partnership. In the assembler company, materials constituted 80% of manufacturing costs with the result that managing supply chain costs has become a most critical element in overall cost control. The company was seeking closer ties involving information sharing and R&D collaboration with suppliers of strategic components. On its part, the supplier wished to move towards the level of co-operation and trust that the two companies had realized in their U.S. operations. The participation of the researchers as neutral intermediaries between the two companies gave them an opportunity to analyse the role of management accounting in the construction of a strategic partnership. The constitutional role of accounting is highlighted together with the \u2026",
                "Longitudinal studies of the nutritional status of 60 lactating Bangladeshi mothers from an underprivileged, periurban community and of the quantity and composition of their milk were completed to determine the relationships between maternal nutritional status and lactational capacity. Daily milk production was estimated by 24-hour test-weighing; the nitrogen, fat, lactose, and total energy concentrations of extracted milk samples were analyzed at various stages of lactation to estimate total milk nutrient production. Although the mothers were poorly nourished compared with international reference populations, their lactational capacity was not severely impaired. Average milk production peaked at 750 g\/d when the infants were between 5 and 7 months of age. Nitrogen and fat concentrations declined with (log) infant age; lactose concentration increased with (log) infant age (P < .001). Average concentrations of milk \u2026",
                "Background.This open, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamivudine prophylaxis given to chronic hepatitis B virus-(HBV) infected patients before and after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We now present long-term data that follow our previous short-term report.Methods.Twenty-three patients were treated with lamivudine (100 mg orally, daily); 13 (57%), were serum HBV DNA positive (Abbott Genostics, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) at study entry. Patients received lamivudine for at least 4 weeks before OLT, and for up to 50 months (median 25 months) after OLT.Results.Of the 23 treated patients, 17 survived to undergo OLT. Eleven patients (65%) survived up to 4 years (median 36 months) after OLT. One of the survivors stopped lamivudine because of a possible adverse reaction 9 months post-OLT, and prophylaxis with HBV immune globulin was then established. Ten \u2026",
                "Background\/Aims: Orthotopic liver transplantation has an established role for the treatment of patients with chronic liver failure secondary to hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection. Unfortunately, recurrent infection of the graft can be associated with aggressive disease, and with diminished graft and patient survival. Currently, the role of nucleoside analogues for prevention of graft re-infection is being evaluated. Preliminary results are encouraging, but treatment failure has been associated with emergence of drug-resistant virus.Methods: We have studied ten consecutive patients who received lamivudine prophylaxis for prevention of HBV graft reinfection. Sequential sera, collected prelamivudine then during treatment before and after liver transplantation, were examined. Conventional serological markers were measured, as were serum viral DNA levels with a sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.Results \u2026"
