                "We show that a simple gravitational theory can provide a holographically dual description of a superconductor. There is a critical temperature, below which a charged condensate forms via a second order phase transition and the (dc) conductivity becomes infinite. The frequency dependent conductivity develops a gap determined by the condensate. We find evidence that the condensate consists of pairs of quasiparticles.",
                "These notes are loosely based on lectures given at the CERN Winter School on Supergravity, Strings and Gauge theories, February 2009, and at the IPM String School in Tehran, April 2009. I have focused on a few concrete topics and also on addressing questions that have arisen repeatedly. Background condensed matter physics material is included as motivation and easy reference for the high energy physics community. The discussion of holographic techniques progresses from equilibrium, to transport and to superconductivity."

                "Sean Hartnoll Associate Professor of Physics On Leave from 10\/01\/2020 To 03\/31\/2021 I am a theorist working on problems in condensed matter, high energy and gravitational physics. The anomalous transport behavior of quantum many-body systems --- including unconventional materials such as high temperature superconductors and other 'strange metals', artificial ultracold atomic systems and the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma --- is a longstanding theoretical challenge that I have approached from several angles. I have suggested that transport in these systems may be controlled by fundamental limitations imposed by quantum statistical mechanics. To this end, I have established bounds on quantum transport that connect the macroscopic properties of these systems to quantities such as the local thermalization rate and underlying quantum mechanical `Lieb-Robinson' velocities. In parallel to this ''bird's eye'' approach, I am also increasingly interested in specific scattering mechanisms in unconventional materials that may give a relatively simple explanation of transport behavior that has otherwise been considered anomalous --- using this approach my collaborators and I have 'demystified' aspects of transport in quantum critical ruthenate materials. I am also working on understanding aspects of the emergence of spacetime from large N matrix quantum mechanics models. These can be thought of as the simplest models of holographic duality, and will likely hold the key to understanding the emergence of local physics as well as black holes. Along with many other theorists, I have found in recent years that the holographic correspondence, the physics of quantum entanglement and quantum field theory more generally have led to strong and unanticipated connections between central concerns in condensed matter and high energy physics. Lists of my publications and of recorded talks and lectures can be found following the links on the right.
