                "We describe the design, fabrication, and performance of a bioreactor that enables both morphogenesis of 3D tissue structures under continuous perfusion and repeated in situ observation by light microscopy. Three\u2010dimensional scaffolds were created by deep reactive ion etching of silicon wafers to create an array of channels (through\u2010holes) with cell\u2010adhesive walls. Scaffolds were combined with a cell\u2010retaining filter and support in a reactor housing designed to deliver a continuous perfusate across the top of the array and through the 3D tissue mass in each channel. Reactor dimensions were constructed so that perfusate flow rates meet estimated values of cellular oxygen demands while providing fluid shear stress at or below a physiological range (<2 dyne cm2), as determined by comparison of numerical models of reactor fluid flow patterns to literature values of physiological shear stresses. We studied the \u2026",
                "We study the center of mass motion of single endodermal Hydra cells in two kinds of cellular aggregates: endodermal and ectodermal. The mean square displacement displays anomalous super-diffusion with <x2>\u223ct\u03b1 where \u03b1>1. The velocity distribution function is non-Gaussian and fits well the q-distribution function of velocities within the framework of the non-extensive thermostatistics proposed by Tsallis. Our results indicate that cell motion in two-dimensional cellular aggregates can be described by a \u201ccorrelated-type\u201d anomalous diffusion.",
                "Actin polymerization provides a powerful propulsion force for numerous types of cell motility. Although tremendous progress has been made in identifying the biochemical components necessary for actin-based motility, the precise biophysical mechanisms of force generation remain unclear. To probe the polymerization forces quantitatively, we introduce an experimental system in which lipid vesicles coated with the Listeria monocytogenes virulence factor ActA are propelled by actin polymerization. The polymerization forces cause significant deformations of the vesicle. We have used these deformations to obtain a spatially resolved measure of the forces exerted on the membrane using a model based on the competition between osmotic pressure and membrane stretching. Our results indicate that actin exerts retractile or propulsive forces depending on the local membrane curvature and that the membrane is \u2026",
                "We report for the first time that primary human neutrophils can undergo persistent, directionally biased movement away from a chemokine in vitro and in vivo, termed chemorepulsion or fugetaxis. Robust neutrophil chemorepulsion in microfluidic gradients of interleukin\u20108 (IL\u20108; CXC chemokine ligand 8) was dependent on the absolute concentration of chemokine, CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), and was associated with polarization of cytoskeletal elements and signaling molecules involved in chemotaxis and leading edge formation. Like chemoattraction, chemorepulsion was pertussis toxin\u2010sensitive and dependent on phosphoinositide\u20103 kinase, RhoGTPases, and associated proteins. Perturbation of neutrophil intracytoplasmic cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations and the activity of protein kinase C isoforms modulated directional bias and persistence of motility and could convert a \u2026",
                "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi have robust bidirectional traffic between them and yet form distinct membrane compartments. Membrane tubules are pulled from large aggregates of ER or Golgi by microtubule motors to form ER tubulovesicular networks or Golgi tubules both in vivo and in vitro. The physical properties of membranes are critical for membrane traffic and organelle morphology. For example, tension applied to membranes can create tethers, drive membrane flow, and set the diameter of the tubules. Here, we formed ER and Golgi membrane networks in vitro and used optical tweezers to measure directly, for the first time, the membrane tensions of these organelles to clarify the possible role of tension in membrane flow. We report that higher forces are needed to form tethers from ER (18.6 \u00b1 2.8 pN) than from Golgi (11.4 \u00b1 1.4 pN) membrane tubules in vitro. Since ER tubules are smaller in \u2026",
                "Cell motion within cellular aggregates consists of both random and coherent components. We used confocal microscopy to study the center of mass displacements and deformations of single endodermal Hydra cells in two kinds of cellular aggregates, ectodermal and endodermal. We first carefully characterize the center of mass displacements using standard statistical analysis. In both aggregates, cells perform a persistent random walk, with the diffusion constant smaller in the more cohesive endodermal aggregate. We show that a simple parametric method is able to describe cell deformations and relate them to displacements. These deformations are random, with their amplitude and direction uncorrelated with the center of mass motion. Unlike for an isolated cell on a substrate, the random forces exerted by the surrounding cells predominate over the deformation of the cell itself, causing the displacements of a \u2026",
                "Because the extended or cellular large-Q Potts model (CPM) captures effectively the global features of tissue rearrangement experiments, including cell sorting and tissue engulfment, it has become a common technique for cell level simulation of tissues. However, it omits three key elements of real cells, their fixed membrane area, their attractive binding and the dissipation of making and breaking membrane contacts. In this paper, we modify the Hamiltonian to use negative surface energies, constrained surface area and a spin flip energy threshold to improve the correspondence to reality. We find that the new model correctly predicts several dynamical behaviors of cells which the original CPM does not, including the hierarchy of diffusion constants.",
                "T-cells are critical for the adaptive immune response in the body. The binding of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells leads to cell spreading and signaling activation. The underlying mechanism of signaling activation is not completely understood. Although cytoskeletal forces have been implicated in this process, the contribution of different cytoskeletal components and their spatial organization are unknown. Here we use traction force microscopy to measure the forces exerted by Jurkat T-cells during TCR activation. Perturbation experiments reveal that these forces are largely due to actin assembly and dynamics, with myosin contractility contributing to the development of force but not its maintenance. We find that Jurkat T-cells are mechanosensitive, with cytoskeletal forces and signaling dynamics both sensitive to the stiffness of the substrate. Our results delineate the \u2026",
                "Actin polymerization provides a major driving force for eukaryotic cell motility. Successive intercalation of monomeric actin subunits between the plasma membrane and the filamentous actin network results in protrusions of the membrane enabling the cell to move or to change shape. One of the challenges in understanding eukaryotic cell motility is to dissect the elementary biochemical and biophysical steps that link actin polymerization to mechanical force generation. Recently, significant progress was made using biomimetic, in vitro systems that are inspired by the actin-based motility of bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. Polystyrene microspheres and synthetic phospholipid vesicles coated with proteins that initiate actin polymerization display motile behavior similar to Listeria, mimicking the leading edge of lamellipodia and filopodia. A major advantage of these biomimetic systems is that both \u2026",
                "The activation of the BCR, which initiates B cell activation, is triggered by Ag-induced self-aggregation and clustering of receptors at the cell surface. Although Ag-induced actin reorganization is known to be involved in BCR clustering in response to membrane-associated Ag, the underlying mechanism that links actin reorganization to BCR activation remains unknown. In this study, we show that both the stimulatory Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) and the inhibitory SHIP-1 are required for efficient BCR self-aggregation. In Btk-deficient B cells, the magnitude of BCR aggregation into clusters and B cell spreading in response to an Ag-tethered lipid bilayer is drastically reduced, compared with BCR aggregation observed in wild-type B cells. In SHIP-1\u2212\/\u2212 B cells, although surface BCRs aggregate into microclusters, the centripetal movement and growth of BCR clusters are inhibited, and B cell spreading is increased. The \u2026"
