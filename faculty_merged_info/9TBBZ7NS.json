We begin with a postbounce model that is optimistic in two important respects:(1) we begin with a 15 M\u2609 precollapse model, which is representative of the class of stars with compact iron cores;(2) we implement Newtonian gravity. Our precollapse model is evolved through core collapse and bounce in one dimension using multigroup (neutrino energy-dependent) flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport and Newtonian Lagrangian hydrodynamics, providing realistic initial conditions for the postbounce convection and evolution."
