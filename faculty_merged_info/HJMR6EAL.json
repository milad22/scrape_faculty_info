                "Mark Messier Mark Messier Distinguished Professor, Physics messier@indiana.edu (812) 855-0236 Swain West 302 B.S., M.I.T., 1993 Ph.D., Boston University, 1999 Resume\/CV high energy experiment and neutrino physics About Mark Messier Professor Messier focuses his research on the experimental study of neutrinos. Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the universe, yet they remain the least understood fundamental particle. Despite their small masses neutrinos contribute nearly as much to the total mass of the universe as stars and planets and their tiny masses are likely associated with new physics at very high energies. Neutrinos may also be linked to the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. Messier serves as co-spokesperson for the NOvA experiment and is a member of the MINOS and MIPP collaborations."
