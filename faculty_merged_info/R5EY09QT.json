                "We report gas and water flow measurements through microfabricated membranes in which aligned carbon nanotubes with diameters of less than 2 nanometers serve as pores. The measured gas flow exceeds predictions of the Knudsen diffusion model by more than an order of magnitude. The measured water flow exceeds values calculated from continuum hydrodynamics models by more than three orders of magnitude and is comparable to flow rates extrapolated from molecular dynamics simulations. The gas and water permeabilities of these nanotube-based membranes are several orders of magnitude higher than those of commercial polycarbonate membranes, despite having pore sizes an order of magnitude smaller. These membranes enable fundamental studies of mass transport in confined environments, as well as more energy-efficient nanoscale filtration.",
                "Mapping the spatial arrangement of chemical functional groups and their interactions is of significant importance to problems ranging from lubrication and adhesion to recognition in biological systems. A force microscope has been used to measure the adhesive and friction forces between molecularly modified probe tips and organic monolayers terminating in a lithographically defined pattern of distinct functional groups. The adhesive interactions between simple CH3\/CH3, CH3\/COOH, and COOH\/COOH functional groups correlate directly with friction images of sample surfaces patterned with these groups. Thus, by monitoring the friction between a specifically functionalized tip and sample, one can produce friction images that display predictable contrast and correspond to the spatial distribution of functional groups on the sample surface. Applications of this chemically sensitive imaging technique are discussed.",
                "A solution to the inversion problem of scattering would offer aberration-free diffraction-limited three-dimensional images without the resolution and depth-of-field limitations of lens-based tomographic systems. Powerful algorithms are increasingly being used to act as lenses to form such images. Current image reconstruction methods, however, require the knowledge of the shape of the object and the low spatial frequencies unavoidably lost in experiments. Diffractive imaging has thus previously been used to increase the resolution of images obtained by other means. Here we experimentally demonstrate an inversion method, which reconstructs the image of the object without the need for any such prior knowledge.",
                "Chemical force microscopy (CFM) has been used to measure adhesion and friction forces between probe tips and substrates covalently modifiedwith self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that terminate in distinct functional groups. Probe tips have been modified with SAMs using a procedure that involves coating commercial Si3N4 cantilever\/tip assemblies with a thin layer of polycrystalline Au followed by immersion in a solution of a functionalized thiol. This methodology provides a reproducible means for endowing the probe with different chemical functional groups. The spring constants and radii of the chemically modified cantilever\/tip assemblies have been characterized to allow for quantitative friction and adhesion measurements. Au-coated Si and Si substrates have been treated with functionalized thiols and silanes, respectively, to produce SAM coated substrates terminatingwith different functional groups. A \u2026",
                "Atomic force microscopy is an imaging tool used widely in fundamental research, although it has, like other scanned probe microscopies, provided only limited information about the chemical nature of systems studied. Modification of force microscope probe tips by covalent linking of organic monolayers that terminate in well-defined functional groups enables direct probing of molecular interactions and imaging with chemical sensitivity. This new chemical force microscopy technique has been used to probe adhesion and frictional forces between distinct chemical groups in organic and aqueous solvents. Contact mechanics provide a framework to model the adhesive forces and to estimate the number of interacting molecular groups. In general, measured adhesive and frictional forces follow trends expected from the strengths of the molecular interactions, although solvation also plays an important role \u2026",
                "Many living organisms contain biominerals and composites with finely tuned properties, reflecting a remarkable level of control over the nucleation, growth and shape of the constituent crystals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Peptides and proteins play an important role in achieving this control 1, 7, 8. But the general view that organic molecules affect mineralization through stereochemical recognition, where geometrical and chemical constraints dictate their binding to a mineral, seems difficult to reconcile 4 with a mechanistic understanding, where crystallization is controlled by thermodynamic and kinetic factors 9. Indeed, traditional crystal growth models emphasize the inhibiting effect of so-called \u2018modifiers\u2019 on surface-step growth, rather than stereochemical matching to newly expressed crystal facets. Here we report in situ atomic force microscope observations and molecular modelling studies of calcite growth in the presence of \u2026",
                "Biological pores regulate the cellular traffic of a large variety of solutes, often with high selectivity and fast flow rates. These pores share several common structural features: the inner surface of the pore is frequently lined with hydrophobic residues, and the selectivity filter regions often contain charged functional groups. Hydrophobic, narrow-diameter carbon nanotubes can provide a simplified model of membrane channels by reproducing these critical features in a simpler and more robust platform. Previous studies demonstrated that carbon nanotube pores can support a water flux comparable to natural aquaporin channels. Here, we investigate ion transport through these pores using a sub-2-nm, aligned carbon nanotube membrane nanofluidic platform. To mimic the charged groups at the selectivity region, we introduce negatively charged groups at the opening of the carbon nanotubes by plasma treatment \u2026",
                "Coherent x-ray diffraction microscopy is a method of imaging nonperiodic isolated objects at resolutions limited, in principle, by only the wavelength and largest scattering angles recorded. We demonstrate x-ray diffraction imaging with high resolution in all three dimensions, as determined by a quantitative analysis of the reconstructed volume images. These images are retrieved from the three-dimensional diffraction data using no a priori knowledge about the shape or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x \u2026",
                "Chemical force microscopy (CFM) was used to probe interactions between ionizable and neutral functional groups in aqueous solutions. Force microscope probe tips and sample substrates have been covalently modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) terminating in distinct functional groups. SAMs were prepared by treating Au-coated or uncoated tips and substrates with functionalized thiols or silanes, respectively. A force microscope has been used to characterize adhesive and frictional interactions between probe tips and substrates modified with SAMs that terminate in \u2212NH2, \u2212COOH, \u2212OH, and \u2212CH3 functional groups as a function of solution pH and ionic strength. In general, adhesion and friction forces were observed to depend on the chemical identity of the tip and sample surface and also were found to be highly sensitive to the changes in the ionization state of the terminal functionalities induced \u2026",
                "Nanoscience encompasses all scientific phenomena that transpire in dimensions spanning the range of multiple atom clusters, molecular aggregates, supermolecular structures, polymers and biomolecules. In other words, nanoscience is the science of the nanoscale\u2014or the very, very minute. Nanotechnology, the technological use of these properties and phenomena, has the potential to revolutionize a breathtaking range of fields, across practically all domains of human activity. The intense interest in using nanostructures stems from the promise that they boast superior electrical, optical, mechanical, chemical, or biochemical properties. There is little doubt that the use of these new materials and systems will lay the ground for the new technological revolution of the 21st century. Research in nanoscience is exploding as scientists from chemistry, physics, and biology, including colloid and polymer chemistry, materials and surface science, and biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology have begun to examine the superior properties that characterize materials and phenomena at the nanoscale. The Dekker Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology is a vehicle by which scientists and the interested public can explore the most recent developments in today's nanomaterials, and preview several of their foreseen applications of tomorrow.
