                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics.

                "A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at TeV, and up to 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, \u03c4\u03c4, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ\u2192 4\u2113, gives a mass estimate of 125. 3\u00b10. 4 (stat.)\u00b10. 5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons. The measured values of the corresponding couplings are compared to the standard model predictions. The hypothesis of custodial symmetry is \u2026"

He also has a small research effort in Type Ia supernovae. Schmitt has been involved in several collider experiments, including the ALEPH experiment at CERN, the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron, and the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC since 2016.\u00a0 Schmitt's research group emphasizes the electroweak sector of the standard model as well as searches for new particles and new phenomena not predicted by the standard model. Current projects include the measurement of the WW and WWW cross sections, both of which provide important tests of theoretical standard model predictions and which might provide evidence for new physics beyond the standard model. Schmitt's group is also exploring the very rare decay of Z bosons to four leptons (branching fraction on the order of a few parts per million) as another test of the standard model and a portal to new non-standard gauge bosons. Schmitt serves as co-convener of the CMS SMP-Combination group whose mission is to extract values of fundamental constants from LHC measurements and to improve the knowledge of parton distribution functions for the proton. The proposed high-granularity calorimeter is a revolutionary new device intended as one of the main upgrades for the high-luminosity LHC.\u00a0 Schmitt's group has carried out the main investigations of the timing capabilities of this unique device; these capabilities will enable a much better rejection of unwanted energy depositions which otherwise will degrade the resolution of jet energies and missing transverse momentum. Schmitt joined the Mu2e Collaboration in 2016.\u00a0 His group is committed to providing an accurate and detailed map of the magnetic field needed for the detection of 105 keV electrons.\u00a0 This map is based on Maxwell's equations and a new type of Bessels function; it uses thousands of Hall probe measurements made in a grid-like pattern inside the magnet. Schmitt's Mu2e group has studied a potentially harmful background stemming from unwanted magnetic traps and also from pions that scatter in the Mu2e stopping target.\u00a0 Currently they are interested in the \u03bc\u203e\u2192e + conversion process.
