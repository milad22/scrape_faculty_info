                "This chapter discusses the theory of image formation within the microscope and the use of optical section microscopy coupled with image processing methods to generate in-focus projected images, stereo pairs, and full three-dimensional representations. It describes practical issues, such as data collection, computational methods for out-of-focus removal, and ways of displaying the results. It also presents the impact of technological advancements as they relate to image quality and real-time analysis. Light microscopy is unique in its ability to allow the examination of biological specimens in a hydrated state in living samples or under conditions that closely approximate the living state. The development of relatively inexpensive computers and digital image acquisition systems has now made possible the three-dimensional reconstruction of images taken from the optical microscope.

                "The structure of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase has been determined with data obtained from amino acid sequence, nucleotide sequence, and X\u2010ray crystallographic studies. The substrate binding sites, as deduced from electron density maps, are compatible with known substrate specificity and the stereochemical requirements for the enzymic reaction. A carboxyl\u2010imidazole interaction appears to be involved in controlling the transition between the open and closed forms of the enzyme.",
                "The eukaryotic nucleolus is involved in ribosome biogenesis and a wide range of other RNA metabolism and cellular functions. An important step in the functional analysis of the nucleolus is to determine the complement of proteins of this nuclear compartment. Here, we describe the first proteomic analysis of plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) nucleoli, in which we have identified 217 proteins. This allows a direct comparison of the proteomes of an important nuclear structure between two widely divergent species: human and Arabidopsis. The comparison identified many common proteins, plant-specific proteins, proteins of unknown function found in both proteomes, and proteins that were nucleolar in plants but nonnucleolar in human. Seventy-two proteins were expressed as GFP fusions and 87% showed nucleolar or nucleolar-associated localization. In a striking and unexpected finding, we have identified six \u2026",
                "We have studied the F-actin network in cycling suspension culture cells of carrot (Daucus carota L.) using rhodaminyl lysine phallotoxin (RLP). In addition to conventional fixation with formaldehyde, we have used two different nonfixation methods before adding RLP: extracting cells in a stabilizing buffer; inducing transient pores in the plasma membrane with pulses of direct current (electroporation). These alternative methods for introducing RLP revealed additional features of the actin network not seen in aldehyde-fixed cells. The three-dimensional organization of this network in nonflattened cells was demonstrated by projecting stereopairs derived from through-focal series of computer-enhanced images. F-actin is present in interphase cells in four interconnected configurations: a meshwork surrounding the nucleus; thick cables in transvacuolar strands and deep in the cytoplasm; a finer network of bundles within \u2026",
                "The nucleolus is the most obvious and clearly differentiated nuclear sub-compartment. It is where ribosome biogenesis takes place, but it is becoming clear that the nucleolus also has non-ribosomal functions. In this review we discuss recent progress in our understanding of how both ribosome biosynthesis and some non-ribosomal functions relate to observable nucleolar structure. We still do not have detailed enough information about the in situ organization of the various processes taking place in the nucleolus. However, the present power of light and electron microscopy techniques means that a description of the organization of nucleolar processes at the molecular level is now achievable, and the time is ripe for such an effort.",
                "The cell wall is an important determinant of plant cell form. Here we define a class of Arabidopsis root hair mutants with defective cell walls. Plants homozygous for kojak (kjk) mutations initiate root hairs that rupture at their tip soon after initiation. The KJK gene was isolated by positional cloning, and its identity was confirmed by the molecular complementation of the Kjk\u2212 phenotype and the sequence of three kjkmutant alleles. KOJAK encodes a cellulose synthase-like protein, AtCSLD3. KOJAK\/AtCSLD3 is the first member of this subfamily of proteins to be shown to have a function in cell growth. Subcellular localization of the KOJAK\/AtCSLD3 protein using a GFP fusion shows that KOJAK\/AtCSLD3 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that KOJAK\/AtCSLD3 is required for the synthesis of a noncellulosic wall polysaccharide. Consistent with the cell specific defect in the roots of kjk mutants, KOJAK \u2026",
                "Background: Cytoplasmic streaming is a conspicuous feature of plant cell behaviour, in which organelles and vesicles shuttle along cytoplasmic strands that contain actin filaments. The mechanisms that regulate streaming and the formation of actin filament networks are largely unknown, but in all likelihood involve actin-binding proteins. The monomeric actin-binding protein, profilin, is a key regulator of actin-filament dynamics in animal cells and it has recently been identified in plants as a pollen allergen. We set out to determine whether plant profilin can act as a monomeric actin-binding protein and influence actin dynamics in plant cells in vivo.Results Recombinant birch-pollen profilin was purified by polyproline affinity chromatography and microinjected into Tradescantia blossfeldiana stamen hair cells. After profilin injection, a rapid and irreversible change in cellular organization and streaming was observed \u2026",
                "The direction in which plant tissue cells expand is reflected in the alignment of microtubules in the cortical array. When microtubules and coaligned wall microfibrils are arranged transversely around the cell, turgor pressure is chaneled into cell elongation. However, various agents (such as wounding, ethylene, abscisic acid) can cause the microtubules to reorientate by 90 degrees so that they become aligned parallel to the cell9s long axis, allowing lateral expansion instead of elongation. The mechanism by which microtubules undergo rapid shifts of alignment is crucial to understanding growth control in plants, but because current models are derived from studies on fixed cells, nothing is known about the dynamics of converting one microtubule alignment to another. Cells tend to have one predominant microtubule alignment--transverse, oblique, or longitudinal--but it is not established whether each represents a \u2026"
