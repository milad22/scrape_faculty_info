                "We review the predictions of the theory of a color glass condensate for a gluon production cross section in p (d) A collisions. We demonstrate that, at moderate energies, when the gluon production cross section can be calculated in the framework of the McLerran-Venugopalan model, it has only a partonic level Cronin effect in it. At higher energies or rapidities corresponding to smaller values of the Bjorken x, quantum evolution becomes important. The effect of quantum evolution at higher energies or rapidities is to introduce the suppression of high-p T gluons slightly decreasing the Cronin enhancement. At still higher energies or rapidities quantum evolution leads to the suppression of produced gluons at all values of p T.",
                "This writeup is a compilation of the predictions for the forthcoming Heavy Ion Program at the Large Hadron Collider, as presented at the CERN Theory Institute'Heavy Ion Collisions at the LHC\u2014Last Call for Predictions', held from 14th May to 10th June 2007.",
                "A measurement of the Z\/\u03b3\u204e transverse momentum (p T Z) distribution in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 TeV is presented using Z\/\u03b3\u204e\u2192 e+ e\u2212 and Z\/\u03b3\u204e\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays collected with the ATLAS detector in data sets with integrated luminosities of 35 pb\u2212 1 and 40 pb\u2212 1, respectively. The normalized differential cross sections are measured separately for electron and muon decay channels as well as for their combination up to p T Z of 350 GeV for invariant dilepton masses 66 GeV< m \u2113 \u2113< 116 GeV. The measurement is compared to predictions of perturbative QCD and various event generators. The prediction of resummed QCD combined with fixed order perturbative QCD is found to be in good agreement with the data.",
                "We extract the bulk viscosity of hot quark\u2013gluon matter in the presence of light quarks from the recent lattice data on the QCD equation of state. For that purpose we extend the sum rule analysis by including the contribution of light quarks. We also discuss the universal properties of bulk viscosity in the vicinity of a second-order phase transition, as it might occur in the chiral limit of QCD at fixed strange quark mass and most likely does occur in two-flavor QCD. We point out that a chiral transition in the O (4) universality class at zero baryon density as well as the transition at the chiral critical point which belongs to the Z (2) universality class both lead to the critical behavior of bulk viscosity. In particular, the latter universality class implies the divergence of the bulk viscosity, which may be used as a signature of the critical point. We discuss the physical picture behind the dramatic increase of bulk viscosity seen in our \u2026",
                "In this paper a solution is given to the non-linear equation which describes the evolution of the parton cascade in the case of the high parton density. The related physics is discussed as well as some applications to heavy ion\u2013ion collisions.",
                "We calculate the cross section of single inclusive gluon production in deep inelastic scattering at very high energies in the saturation regime, where the parton densities inside hadrons and nuclei are large and the evolution of structure functions with energy is nonlinear. The expression we obtain for the inclusive gluon production cross section is generated by this nonlinear evolution. We analyze the rapidity distribution of the produced gluons as well as their transverse momentum spectrum given by the derived expression for the inclusive cross section. We propose an ansatz for the multiplicity distribution of gluons produced in nuclear collisions which includes the effects of nonlinear evolution in both colliding nuclei.",
                "I review the origin and properties of electromagnetic fields produced in heavy-ion collisions. The field strength immediately after a collision is proportional to the collision energy and reaches ~                      at RHIC and ~                      at LHC. I demonstrate by explicit analytical calculation that after dropping by about one-two orders of magnitude during the first fm\/c of plasma expansion, it freezes out and lasts for as long as quark-gluon plasma lives as a consequence of finite electrical conductivity of the plasma. Magnetic field breaks spherical symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane, and therefore all kinetic coefficients are anisotropic. I examine viscosity of QGP and show that magnetic field induces azimuthal anisotropy on plasma flow even in spherically symmetric geometry. Very strong electromagnetic field has an important impact on particle production. I discuss the problem of energy loss and polarization of fast fermions due to synchrotron radiation, consider photon decay induced by magnetic field, elucidate                  dissociation via Lorentz ionization mechanism, and examine electromagnetic radiation by plasma. I conclude that all processes in QGP are affected by strong electromagnetic field and call for experimental investigation.",
                "We perform a quantitative analysis of the nuclear modification factor in deuteron\u2013gold collisions R d Au within the Color Glass Condensate approach, and compare our results with the recent data from RHIC experiments. Our model leads to Cronin enhancement at mid-rapidity, while at forward rapidities it predicts strong suppression of R d Au at all p T due to low-x evolution. We demonstrate that our results are consistent with the data for dAu charged hadron spectra, R d Au and R CP recently reported for rapidities in the interval \u03b7= 0\u20133.2 by the BRAHMS experiment at RHIC. We also make a prediction for R pA at mid-rapidity in pA collisions at the LHC.",
                "Kubo's formula relates bulk viscosity to the retarded Green's function of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Using low energy theorems of QCD for the latter we derive the formula which relates the bulk viscosity to the energy density and pressure of hot matter. We then employ the available lattice QCD data to extract the bulk viscosity as a function of temperature. We find that close to the deconfinement temperature bulk viscosity becomes large, with viscosity-to-entropy ratio \u03b6\/s~ 1.",
                "We develop a new approach for solving the nonlinear evolution equation in the low x B region and show that the remarkable \u201cgeometric\u201d scaling of its solution holds not only in the saturation region, but in much wider kinematical region. This is in a full agreement with experimental data (Golec-Biernat, Kwiecinski and Stasto)."
