                "Single-photon sources have recently been demonstrated using a variety of devices, including molecules 1, 2, 3, mesoscopic quantum wells 4, colour centres 5, trapped ions 6 and semiconductor quantum dots 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Compared with a Poisson-distributed source of the same intensity, these sources rarely emit two or more photons in the same pulse. Numerous applications for single-photon sources have been proposed in the field of quantum information, but most\u2014including linear-optical quantum computation 12\u2014also require consecutive photons to have identical wave packets. For a source based on a single quantum emitter, the emitter must therefore be excited in a rapid or deterministic way, and interact little with its surrounding environment. Here we test the indistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor quantum dot in a microcavity through a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel-type two-photon interference \u2026"
