                "The ADMIRE-HF (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure) study prospectively evaluated iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG) imaging for identifying symptomatic heart failure (HF) patients most likely to experience cardiac events.Single-center studies have demonstrated the poorer prognosis of HF patients with reduced 123I-mIBG myocardial uptake, but these observations have not been validated in large multicenter trials.A total of 961 subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II\/III HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226435% were studied. Subjects underwent 123I-mIBG myocardial imaging (sympathetic neuronal integrity quantified as the heart\/mediastinum uptake ratio [H\/M] on 4-h delayed planar images) and myocardial perfusion imaging and were then followed up for up to 2 years.

                "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality for women in the United States. Coronary heart disease, which includes coronary atherosclerotic disease, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, and angina, is the largest subset of this mortality, with >240 000 women dying annually from the disease. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) is the focus of this consensus statement. Research continues to report underrecognition and underdiagnosis of CAD as contributory to high mortality rates in women. Timely and accurate diagnosis can significantly reduce CAD mortality for women; indeed, once the diagnosis is made, it does appear that current treatments are equally effective at reducing risk in both women and men. As such, noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic testing offers the potential to identify women at increased CAD risk as the basis for instituting preventive and therapeutic \u2026",
                "Atherosclerosis is thought to be a disease of modern human beings and related to contemporary lifestyles. However, its prevalence before the modern era is unknown. We aimed to evaluate preindustrial populations for atherosclerosis.We obtained whole body CT scans of 137 mummies from four different geographical regions or populations spanning more than 4000 years. Individuals from ancient Egypt, ancient Peru, the Ancestral Puebloans of southwest America, and the Unangan of the Aleutian Islands were imaged. Atherosclerosis was regarded as definite if a calcified plaque was seen in the wall of an artery and probable if calcifications were seen along the expected course of an artery.Probable or definite atherosclerosis was noted in 47 (34%) of 137 mummies and in all four geographical populations: 29 (38%) of 76 ancient Egyptians, 13 (25%) of 51 ancient Peruvians, two (40 \u2026",

                "This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of mipomersen for reducing atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins in patients with hypercholesterolemia.Many patients on lipid-lowering therapies remain unable to achieve target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein B, reduces LDL cholesterol and atherogenic lipoproteins.This randomized, double-blind, multicenter study enrolled 158 patients with baseline LDL cholesterol levels \u2265100 mg\/dl with, or at high risk for, coronary heart disease who were receiving maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. Patients received weekly subcutaneous mipomersen 200 mg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 52) for 26 weeks, with a 24-week follow-up period. Randomization was stratified by type 2 diabetes status.Sixty mipomersen and 44 placebo patients \u2026"
