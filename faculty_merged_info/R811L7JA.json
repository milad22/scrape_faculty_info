                "We report the white light flare rates for 10 ultracool dwarfs using Kepler K2 short-cadence data. Among our sample stars, two have spectral type M6, three are M7, three are M8, and two are L0. Most of our targets are old low-mass stars. We identify a total of 283 flares in all of the stars in our sample, with Kepler energies in the range log E Kp~(29\u201333.5) erg. Using the maximum-likelihood method of line fitting, we find that the flare frequency distribution (FFD) for each star in our sample follows a power law with slope\u2212 \u03b1 in the range\u2212(1.3\u20132.0). We find that cooler objects tend to have shallower slopes. For some of our targets, the FFD follows either a broken power law, or a power law with an exponential cutoff. For the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we find a very shallow slope (\u2212 \u03b1=\u2212 1.3) in the Kepler energy range (0.82\u2013130)\u00d7 10 30 erg: this L0 dwarf has flare rates which are comparable to those of high \u2026",
                "We use Kepler K2 Campaign 4 short-cadence (one-minute) photometry to measure white light flares in the young, moving group brown dwarfs 2MASS J03350208+ 2342356 (2M0335+ 23) and 2MASS J03552337+ 1133437 (2M0355+ 11), and report on long-cadence (thirty-minute) photometry of a superflare in the Pleiades M8 brown dwarf CFHT-PL-17. The rotation period (5.24 hr) and projected rotational velocity (45 km s\u2212 1) confirm 2M0335+ 23 is inflated () as predicted for a , 24 Myr old brown dwarf \u03b2Pic moving group member. We detect 22 white light flares on 2M0335+ 23. The flare frequency distribution follows a power-law distribution with slope  over the range 10 31 to 10 33 erg. This slope is similar to that observed in the Sun and warmer flare stars, and is consistent with lower-energy flares in previous work on M6\u2013M8 very-low-mass stars; taking the two data sets together, the flare \u2026",
                "Observations of solar and stellar flares have revealed the presence of power-law dependences between the flare energy and the time interval between flares. Various models have been proposed to explain these dependences and the numerical value of the power-law indices. Here, we propose a model in which convective flows in granules force the footpoints of coronal magnetic loops, which are frozen-in to photospheric gas, to undergo a random walk. In certain conditions, this can lead to a twist in the loop, which drives the loop unstable if the twist exceeds a critical value. The possibility that a solar flare is caused by such a twist-induced instability in a loop has been in the literature for decades. Here, we quantify the process in an approximate way with a view to replicating the power-law index. We find that, for relatively small flares, the random walk twisting model leads to a rather steep power-law slope that \u2026",
                "We report on K2 Campaign 8 measurements of a huge white light flare on the L1 dwarf SDSSp J005406. 55-003101.8 (EPIC 220186653). The source is a typical L1 dwarf at a distance of~ 50 pc, probably an old hydrogen-burning star rather than a young brown dwarf. In the long (30-minute) cadence photometry, the flare peak is 21 times the flux of the stellar photosphere in the broad optical Kepler filter, which we estimate corresponds to \u0394V\u2248\u2212 7.1. The total equivalent duration of the flare is 15.4 hr. We estimate that the total bolometric energy of the flare was 4\u00d7 10 33 erg, more powerful than the previously reported Kepler white light flares for the L1 dwarf WISEP J190648. 47+ 401106.8, but weaker than the \u0394V=\u2212 11 L0 dwarf superflare ASASSN-16ae. The initial (impulsive) cooling phase is too rapid to resolve with our 30-minute cadence data, but after 1 hour the gradual cooling phase has an exponential time \u2026",
                "We observed strong superflares (defined as flares with energy in excess of 1033 erg) on three late-M dwarfs: 2MASS J08315742+2042213 (hereafter 2M0831+2042; M7 V), 2MASS J08371832+2050349 (hereafter 2M0837+2050; M8 V), and 2MASS J08312608+2244586 (hereafter 2M0831+2244; M9 V). 2M0831+2042 and 2M0837+2050 are members of the young (\u223c700 Myr) open cluster Praesepe. The strong superflare on 2M0831+2042 has an equivalent duration (ED) of 13.7 h and an estimated energy of 1.3 \u00d7 1035 erg. We observed five superflares on 2M0837+2050, on which the strongest superflare has an ED of 46.4 h and an estimated energy of 3.5 \u00d7 1035 erg. This energy is larger by 2.7 orders of magnitude than the largest flare observed on the older (7.6 Gyr) planet-hosting M8 dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Furthermore, we also observed five superflares on 2M0831+2244 which is probably a field star. The \u2026",
                "We present the discovery and validation of a three-planet system orbiting the nearby (31.1 pc) M2 dwarf star TOI-700 (TIC 150428135). TOI-700 lies in the TESS continuous viewing zone in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere; observations spanning 11 sectors reveal three planets with radii ranging from 1 R\u2295 to 2.6 R\u2295 and orbital periods ranging from 9.98 to 37.43 days. Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enables us to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the system of planets. The outermost planet, TOI-700 d, has a radius of 1.19\u00b10.11 R\u2295 and resides within a conservative estimate of the host star's habitable zone, where it receives a flux from its star that is approximately 86% of Earth's insolation. In contrast to some other low-mass stars that host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, TOI-700 exhibits low levels of stellar activity \u2026",
                "We present photometric measurements of two superflares observed on a very young brown dwarf, CFHT-BD-Tau 4, observed during Campaign 13 of the Kepler K 2 mission. The stronger of the two superflares brightened by a factor of~ 48 relative to the quiescent photospheric level, with an increase in Kepler magnitude . It has an equivalent duration of~ 107 hr, a flare duration of 1.7 days, and an estimated total bolometric (ultraviolet\/optical\/infrared) energy up to 2.1\u00d7 10 38 erg. The weaker of the two superflares is a complex (multipeaked) flare with an estimated total bolometric (UV\/optical\/IR) energy up to 4.7\u00d7 10 36 erg. They are the strongest flares observed on any brown dwarf so far. The flare energies are strongly dependent on the value of the visual extinction parameter A V used for extinction correction. If we apply a solar flare model to interpret the two superflares, we find that the magnetic fields are \u2026",
                "Type II radio bursts are observed in the Sun in association with many coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In view of this association, there has been an expectation that, by scaling from solar flares to the flares that are observed on M dwarfs, radio emission analogous to solar type II bursts should be detectable in association with M dwarf flares. However, several surveys have revealed that this expectation does not seem to be fulfilled. Here we hypothesize that the presence of larger global field strengths in low-mass stars, suggested by recent magnetoconvective modeling, gives rise to such large Alfv\u00e9n speeds in the corona that it becomes difficult to satisfy the conditions for the generation of type II radio bursts. As a result, CMEs propagating in the corona\/wind of flare stars are expected to be\" radio-quiet\" as regards type II bursts. In view of this, we suggest that, in the context of type II bursts, scaling from solar to stellar \u2026",
                "We present spatial orientations of angular momentum vectors of galaxies in three merging binary clusters A1750, A3395 and A3528. The axial ratio and intrinsic flatness of galaxy are used to convert two-dimensional given parameters into three-dimensional angular momentum vector of the galaxy. We have performed K-S, Kuiper and Fourier tests in order to examine non-random effects. The merging binary cluster A3395 that exhibits strongly distorted feature in its maps of temperature and surface brightness showed a random orientation in the spatial orientation of angular momentum vectors of galaxies. A weak anisotropic distribution in the angular momentum vectors of galaxies is noticed in the sub-structures of A3528. We suspect a relation between the stages of merging and the non-random alignments of galaxies in the sub-structures of the binary clusters. Possible explanation of the results will be \u2026",
                "  long cadence data are used to study white light flares in a sample of 45 L dwarfs. We identified 11 flares on 9 L dwarfs with equivalent durations of (1.3\u2013198) h and total (UV\/optical\/IR) energies of \u22650.9 \u00d7 1032 erg. Two superflares with energies of >1033 erg were detected on an L5 dwarf (VVV BD001): this is the coolest object so far on which flares have been identified. The larger superflare on this L5 dwarf has an energy of 4.6 \u00d7 1034 erg and an amplitude of >300 times the photospheric level: so far, this is the largest amplitude flare detected by the Kepler\/K2 mission. The next coolest star on which we identified a flare was an L2 dwarf: 2MASS J08585891+1804463. Combining the energies of all the flares which we have identified on 9 L dwarfs with the total observation time which was dedicated by Kepler to all 45 L dwarfs, we construct a composite flare frequency distribution (FFD).
