                "When a spilled drop of coffee dries on a solid surface, it leaves a dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The coffee\u2014initially dispersed over the entire drop\u2014becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time\u2014a law independent of the particular \u2026",
                "Solids dispersed in a drying drop will migrate to the edge of the drop and form a solid ring. This phenomenon produces ringlike stains and occurs for a wide range of surfaces, solvents, and solutes. Here we show that the migration is caused by an outward flow within the drop that is driven by the loss of solvent by evaporation and geometrical constraint that the drop maintain an equilibrium droplet shape with a fixed boundary. We describe a theory that predicts the flow velocity, the rate of growth of the ring, and the distribution of solute within the drop. These predictions are compared with our experimental results.",
                "Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is an idealization of the process by which matter irreversibly combines to form dust, soot, dendrites, and other random objects in the case where the rate-limiting step is diffusion of matter to the aggregate. We study the process from several points of view stressing the fact that it apparently gives rise to scale-invariant objects whose Hausdorff dimension is independent of short-range details. We show that DLA has no upper critical dimension. We apply scale invariance to study growth, gelation, and the structure factor of aggregates.",
                "One of the main goals of polymer sciencehas been to relate the structure of macromolecular chains to their macroscopic properties. In particular, it has been hoped that one could relate the sizes of polymer coils to the degree to which they entangle with one another and thus to their viscoelasticity in the melt. In recent years, the availability of model polymers with nearly monodisperse molecular weight distributions and precisely controlled chemical structures has allowed for improved data both on rheology and on the dimensions of the chains. This has now allowed us to determine the correlations between such properties as chain dimensions, density, and plateau modulus and to show that some quite simple relations exist between them. The main body of these data is on polymers that can be considered to be models for polyolefins. These have been madeby the hydrogenation of polydienes synthesized by anionic \u2026",
                "We calculate the free energy of surfaces coated with grafted polymers in a solvent. We use a self-consistent field (SCF) method appropriate for weak excluded-volume interactions and at moderately high surface coverage. We give the exact solution for the \u201cclassical limit\u201d of our SCF equations which shows that, at high molecular weight, the concentration profile approaches a parabolic form rather than the step-function suggested by Alexander and de Gennes. Accordingly, the energy required to slightly compress the brush varies as the cube of the compression distance. An extension of the method to the good-solvent, semidilute regime is described.",
                "When a drop of a colloidal solution of nanoparticles dries on a surface, it leaves behind coffee-stain-like rings of material with lace-like patterns or clumps of particles in the interior 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These non-uniform mass distributions are manifestations of far-from-equilibrium effects, such as fluid flows 1 and solvent fluctuations during late-stage drying 2. However, recently a strikingly different drying regime promising highly uniform, long-range-ordered nanocrystal monolayers has been found 7, 8. Here we make direct, real-time and real-space observations of nanocrystal self-assembly to reveal the mechanism. We show how the morphology of drop-deposited nanoparticle films is controlled by evaporation kinetics and particle interactions with the liquid\u2013air interface. In the presence of an attractive particle\u2013interface interaction, rapid early-stage evaporation dynamically produces a two-dimensional solution of \u2026",
                "Experimental observations and numerical simulations of the large force inhomogeneities present in stationary bead packs are presented. Forces much larger than the mean occurred but were exponentially rare. An exactly soluble model reproduced many aspects of the experiments and simulations. In this model, the fluctuations in the force distribution arise because of variations in the contact angles and the constraints imposed by the force balance on each bead in the pile.",
                "We study theoretically the complex network of forces that is responsible for the static structure and properties of granular materials. We present detailed calculations for a model in which the fluctuations in the force distribution arise because of variations in the contact angles and the constraints imposed by the force balance on each bead of the pile. We compare our results for the force distribution function for this model, including exact results for certain contact angle probability distributions, with numerical simulations of force distributions in random sphere packings. This model reproduces many aspects of the force distribution observed both in experiment and in numerical simulations of sphere packings. Our model is closely related to some that have been studied in the context of self-organized criticality. We present evidence that in the force distribution context,\" critical\" power-law force distributions occur only when \u2026",
                "We study the statistics of a grafted polymer brush, consisting of a set of monodisperse chains in solution, each attached irreversibly by one end to a flat surface. We use a self-consistent field method, valid in the limit of weak excluded volume and at moderately high surface coverage. Exploiting the fact that the chains are highly stretched, we map the problem (in the long-chain limit) onto one involving the motion of classical particles in an equal-time potential, which we can solve exactly. The resulting density profile for the brush takes a parabolic form.",
                "Glasses have a large excess of low-frequency vibrational modes in comparison with most crystalline solids. We show that such a feature is a necessary consequence of the weak connectivity of the solid, and that the frequency of modes in excess is very sensitive to the pressure. We analyze, in particular, two systems whose density D (\u03c9) of vibrational modes of angular frequency \u03c9 display scaling behaviors with the packing fraction:(i) simulations of jammed packings of particles interacting through finite-range, purely repulsive potentials, comprised of weakly compressed spheres at zero temperature and (ii) a system with the same network of contacts, but where the force between any particles in contact (and therefore the total pressure) is set to zero. We account in the two cases for the observed (a) convergence of D (\u03c9) toward a nonzero constant as \u03c9\u2192 0,(b) appearance of a low-frequency cutoff \u03c9*, and (c) power \u2026"
