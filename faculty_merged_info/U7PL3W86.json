                "We experimentally demonstrate a supercurrent-assisted, hotspot-formation mechanism for ultrafast detection and counting of visible and infrared photons. A photon-induced hotspot leads to a temporary formation of a resistive barrier across the superconducting sensor strip and results in an easily measurable voltage pulse. Subsequent hotspot healing in \u223c30 ps time frame, restores the superconductivity (zero-voltage state), and the detector is ready to register another photon. Our device consists of an ultrathin, very narrow NbN strip, maintained at 4.2 K and current-biased close to the critical current. It exhibits an experimentally measured quantum efficiency of \u223c20% for 0.81 \u03bcm wavelength photons and negligible dark counts.",
                "We report our studies on spectral sensitivity of meander-type, superconducting NbN thin-film single-photon detectors (SPDs), characterized by GHz counting rates of visible and near-infrared photons and negligible dark counts. Our SPDs exhibit experimentally determined quantum efficiencies ranging from \u223c0.2% at the 1.55 \u03bcm wavelength to \u223c70% at 0.4 \u03bcm. Spectral dependences of the detection efficiency (DE) at the 0.4 to 3.0-\u03bcm-wavelength range are presented. The exponential character of the DE dependence on wavelength, as well as its dependence versus bias current, is qualitatively explained in terms of superconducting fluctuations in our ultrathin, submicron-width superconducting stripes. The DE values of large-active-area NbN SPDs in the visible range are high enough for modern quantum communications.",
                "The paper reviews the main aspects of nonequilibrium hot-electron phenomena in superconductors and various theoretical models developed to describe the hot-electron effect. We discuss implementation of the hot-electron avalanche mechanism in superconducting radiation sensors and present the most successful practical devices, such as terahertz mixers and direct intensity detectors, for far-infrared radiation. Our presentation also includes the novel approach to hot-electron quantum detection implemented in superconducting x-ray to optical photon counters.",
                "We have measured the quantum efficiency (QE), GHz counting rate, jitter, and noise-equivalent power (NEP) of nanostructured NbN superconducting single-photon detectors (SSPDs) in the visible to infrared radiation range. Our 3.5-nm-thick and 100- to 200-nm-wide meander-type devices (total area 10\u00d710\u03bcm2), operating at 4.2K, exhibit an experimental QE of up to 20% in the visible range and \u223c10% at 1.3 to 1.55\u03bcm wavelength and are potentially sensitive up to midinfrared (\u223c10\u03bcm) radiation. The SSPD counting rate was measured to be above 2GHz with jitter <18ps, independent of the wavelength. The devices\u2019 NEP varies from \u223c10\u221217W\u2215Hz1\u22152 for 1.55\u03bcm photons to \u223c10\u221220W\u2215Hz1\u22152 for visible radiation. Lowering the SSPD operating temperature to 2.3K significantly enhanced its performance, by increasing the QE to \u223c20% and lowering the NEP level to \u223c3\u00d710\u221222W\u2215Hz1\u22152, both measured at 1 \u2026",
                "We report time-resolved characterization of superconducting NbN hot-electron photodetectors using an electro-optic sampling method. Our samples were patterned into micron-size microbridges from 3.5-nm-thick NbN films deposited on sapphire substrates. The devices were illuminated with 100 fs optical pulses, and the photoresponse was measured in the ambient temperature range between 2.15 and 10.6 K (superconducting temperature transition TC). The experimental data agreed very well with the nonequilibrium hot-electron, two-temperature model. The quasiparticle thermalization time was ambient temperature independent and was measured to be 6.5 ps. The inelastic electron\u2013phonon scattering time \u03c4e\u2013ph tended to decrease with the temperature increase, although its change remained within the experimental error, while the phonon escape time \u03c4es decreased almost by a factor of two when the sample \u2026",
                "Fabrication of NbN superconducting single-photon detectors, based on the hotspot effect is presented. The hotspot formation arises in an ultrathin and submicrometer-width superconductor stripe and, together with the supercurrent redistribution, leads to the resistive detector response upon absorption of a photon. The detector has a meander structure to maximally increase its active area and reach the highest detection efficiency. Main processing steps, leading to efficient devices, sensitive in 0.4-5 \/spl mu\/m wavelength range, are presented. The impact of various processing steps on the performance and operational parameters of our detectors is discussed.",
                "The structures of CaYAlO 4, CaNdAlO 4, and SrLaAlO 4 have been refined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. These compounds possess the full symmetry of the K 2 NiF 4 structure type, I4 mmm, with lattice parameters a= 3.6451 (1) and c= 11.8743 (6) \u00c5 for CaYAlO 4, a= 3.6847 (3) and c= 12.124 (2) \u00c5 for CaNdAlO 4, and a= 3.7564 (1) and c= 12.6357 (5) \u00c5 for SrLaAlO 4. Inspection of the interatomic distances reveals stretching of the Al\ue5f8 O bond, from an average of 1.878 to 1.901 to 1.935 \u00c5, as smaller cations (CaY) are replaced by larger cations (CaNd) and (SrLa) in the MM\u2032 sites between the two dimensional aluminate sheets. The dielectric constants (\u03ba\u2032) and dielectric loss values of CaYAlO 4, CaNdAlO 4, and SrLaAlO 4 were measured at 1 MHz using a two-terminal method with empirically determined edge corrections. The results are CaYAlO 4 \u03ba\u2032 a= 21.44\u00b1. 02 tan \u03b4 a= 0.0008 \u03ba\u2032 c= 16 \u2026",
                "We report our femtosecond time-resolved measurements on the photoresponse of an epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x (YBCO) thin-film photodetector, patterned into a microbridge geometry. By varying the current\u2013voltage biasing conditions between the superconducting and resistive (hot spot) states, we observed transients that correspond to the nonequilibrium kinetic-inductance and the nonequilibrium electron-heating response mechanisms, respectively. The two-temperature model and the Rothwarf\u2013Taylor theory have been used to simulate the measured wave forms and to extract the temporal parameters. The electron thermalization time and the electron\u2013phonon energy relaxation time were determined by the electron temperature rise and decay times, which were found to be 0.56 and 1.1 ps, respectively, in the resistive state. We have also measured the ratio between the phonon and electron specific heats to be 38 \u2026",
                "We present an overview of the state-of-the-art of NbN superconducting single-photon detectors (SSPDs). Our devices exhibit quantum efficiency (QE) of up to 30% in near-infrared wavelength and 0.4% at 5 mum, with a dark-count rate that can be as low as 10 -4  s -1 . The SSPD structures integrated with lambda\/4 microcavities achieve a QE of 60% at telecommunication, 1550-nm wavelength. We have also developed a new generation of SSPDs that possess the QE of large-active-area devices, but, simultaneously, are characterized by low kinetic inductance that allows achieving short response times and the GHz-counting rate with picosecond timing jitter. The improvements presented in the SSPD development, such as fiber-coupled SSPDs, make our detectors most attractive for high-speed quantum communications and quantum computing.",
                "We present a new class of ultrafast single-photon detectors for counting both visible and infrared photons. The detection mechanism is based on photon-induced hotspot formation, which forces the supercurrent redistribution and leads to the appearance of a transient resistive barrier across an ultrathin, submicrometer-width, superconducting stripe. The devices were fabricated from 3.5-nm- and 10-nm-thick NbN films, patterned into <200-nm-wide stripes in the 4 \/spl times\/ 4-\/spl mu\/m\/sup 2\/ or 10 \/spl times\/ 10-\/spl mu\/m\/sup 2\/ meander-type geometry, and operated at 4.2 K, well below the NbN critical temperature (T\/sub c\/=10-11 K). Continuous-wave and pulsed-laser optical sources in the 400-nm-to 3500-nm-wavelength range were used to determine the detector performance in the photon-counting mode. Experimental quantum efficiency was found to exponentially depend on the photon wavelength, and for our \u2026"
