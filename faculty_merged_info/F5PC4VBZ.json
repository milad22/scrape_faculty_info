                "Dalgis Mesa Instructor Ph.D., 2014 - Louisiana State University 341 Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. Baton Rouge, LA 70803-4001 dmesa1@lsu.edu Physics Education Group Experimental Condensed Matter Physics My area of expertise is in the field of Neutron Scattering. I dedicated my graduate\n                     studies at LSU to the study of electron spin and lattice coupling in large aggregates\n                     of interacting or 'correlated' electrons systems. These correlated systems are of\n                     great interest in the scientific community due to the exotic phenomena and novel functionalities\n                     that emerge as a result of their strong interaction. I also deeply enjoy teaching\n                     and I am always exploring new, innovative and non-traditional teaching methods."
