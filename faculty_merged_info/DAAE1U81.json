                "In this review, recent works related to the selective CO removal in a H2-rich stream for the application of the low-temperature fuel cell are discussed. The membrane separation, the selective CO hydrogenation, and the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) have been generally studied to meet the requirement for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) where the CO concentration should be controlled to be less than 10 ppm not to degrade the electrochemical performance of Pt anode. For the membrane separation, the thin layer of Pd-based alloy metal on the porous ceramic material coupled with the catalytic purification is the most advanced method at present. For PROX catalysts, supported Ru catalysts and Pt-based alloy catalysts have been successfully developed so far. The combination of highly selective PROX catalysts and the CO methanation catalyst can provide the extended temperature range to \u2026",
                "Alumina nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanorods were synthesized through a new method based on a surfactant-driven hydrothermal process, but without adding any organic solvent. Our procedure provides a single-step, low-temperature route to different alumina nanostructures with thermal stability by varying the nature of surfactants. ",
                "Highly active bimetallic catalysts, Pt\u2013Co nanoparticles supported on yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ; see picture) can be prepared in a single step by co\u2010impregnation. This system shows a high catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of CO in the presence of excess hydrogen, especially at temperatures below 423 K.",
                "Nanostructured crystalline \u03b3-alumina was synthesized by a simpler and improved method proposed here from aluminum alkoxide precursor in the presence of a cationic surfactant and controlled amounts of water under hydrothermal conditions without any extra additives such as hydrolysis controlling agents. The material synthesized with a stoichiometric amount of water (H2O\/Al = 2) was a mesoporous molecular sieve with a \u2018wormhole-like\u2019 pore structure. With increasing amounts of water (H2O\/Al = 10 or 20), bundles of \u03b3-alumina nanofibers were formed, and with H2O\/Al > 20, materials with no definite morphology were formed, probably due to too fast hydrolysis of the precursor. The nanostructured materials had high surface areas and a good thermal stability.",
                "Selective CO oxidation in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over metal oxides (CoO and CuO\u2013CeO2), supported gold catalysts (Au\/\u03b3-Al2O3, Au\/CuO, Au\/CeO2\/\u03b3-Al2O3, Au\/CuO\u2013CeO2 and Au\/CeO2), and supported Pt catalysts (Pt\/\u03b3-Al2O3, Pt\u2013Ni\/\u03b3-Al2O3, and Pt\u2013Co\/\u03b3-Al2O3). The methanation was dominant over CoO in the presence of excess H2. CuO\u2013CeO2 was quite selective for CO oxidation at low temperatures. However, the presence of CO2 and H2O retarded its catalytic activity. No beneficial effect to CO2 selectivity was observed when Pt, Ru, Ni, and Co was added to CuO\u2013CeO2 as a modifier. Supported gold catalysts showed the high CO conversion at low temperatures. However, the CO2 selectivity decreased noticeably with increasing H2 concentration in a reactant. Pt\u2013Ni\/\u03b3-Al2O3 showed the highest CO conversion with a high CO2 selectivity over a wide reaction temperature among above \u2026",
                "The preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in the presence of excess hydrogen was studied over Pt\u2013Ni\/\u03b3-Al2O3. CO chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction were conducted to characterize active catalysts. The co-impregnated Pt\u2013Ni\/\u03b3-Al2O3 was superior to Pt\/Ni\/\u03b3-Al2O3 and Ni\/Pt\/\u03b3-Al2O3 prepared by a sequential impregnation of each component on alumina support. The PROX activity was affected by the reductive pretreatment condition. The pre-reduction was essential for the low-temperature PROX activity. As the reduction temperature increased above 423 K, the CO2 selectivity decreased and the atomic percent of Ni in the bimetallic phase of Pt\u2013Ni increased. This catalyst exhibited the high CO conversion even in the presence of 2% H2O and 20% CO2 over a wide reaction temperature. The bimetallic phase of \u2026",
                "We conducted a comparative study for the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) over supported noble metal catalysts. The CO chemisorption in the absence and presence of H2, the O2 chemisorption, the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) after O2 chemisorption and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted to characterize the catalysts. Commercial catalysts such as 1 wt.% Pt\/\u03b3-Al2O3, 0.5 wt.% Ru\/\u03b3-Al2O3, 0.5 wt.% Rh\/\u03b3-Al2O3, 5 wt.% Pt\/\u03b3-Al2O3, 5 wt.% Ru\/\u03b3-Al2O3, and 5 wt.% Rh\/\u03b3-Al2O3 were utilized. Among them, 5 wt.% Ru\/\u03b3-Al2O3 showed the highest PROX activity. This catalyst can be considered to be promising because it can reduce the high inlet CO concentration to be less than 10 ppm at low temperatures where the reverse water\u2013gas shift reaction can be minimized. No detectable amount of chemisorbed O2 was measured at 373 K \u2026",
                "We prepared various Ru catalysts supported on different supports such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2 and \u03b3-Al2O3 with a wet impregnation method. We applied them to the selective CO removal in a hydrogen-rich stream via the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) and the selective CO methanation simultaneously. Among them, Ru\/YSZ showed the highest CO conversion especially at low temperatures. Several measurements: the N2 physisorption, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), the CO chemisorptions, the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2 with mass spectroscopy and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were conducted to characterize the catalysts. No linear correlation can be found between the amount of CO chemisorbed at 300 K and \u2026",
                "Nano-structured MgO\u2013Al2O3 aerogel adsorbents (denoted as MgAl-AE-X) with different Mg\/Al molar ratio (X) were prepared by a single-step epoxide-driven sol\u2013gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. The effect of Mg\/Al molar ratio of nano-structured MgO\u2013Al2O3 aerogel adsorbents on their physicochemical properties and CO2 adsorptive performance at elevated temperature (200 \u00b0C) was investigated. Successful formation of flower-like nano-structured MgAl-AE-X adsorbents was confirmed by N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and SEM analyses. The crystalline structure of MgAl-AE-X adsorbents was transformed in the sequence of Al2O3 \u2192 MgAl2O4 \u2192 MgO-MgAl2O4 with increasing Mg\/Al molar ratio from 0 to 3. All the MgAl-AE-X adsorbents were found to possess weak base site and medium base site except for strong base site. In the dynamic CO2 adsorption, both the total CO2 \u2026",
                "We revealed the first example of a crystalline lithium aluminate nanotube with thermal stability prepared by a surfactant-driven hydrothermal procedure. The obtained nanotube showed an interesting structure unknown thus far for oxide nanotubes such as cylindrical bundles of lithium aluminate subnanotubules. These novel nanotubules had walls of crystalline lithium aluminate with a honeycomblike Al\u2212O wall-network surrounding a central lithium core that forms a linear array of atoms and could be a promising solid ion conducting material.
