                "Mihai Gherase Associate Professor of Physics, Biomedical Physics Advisor S2 311A (559) 278-1766 Email: mgherase@csufresno.edu PHYS 170A 9:30AM to 10:45AM Ph.D., Carleton University I am interested in medical and biological applications of x-ray fluorescence (XRF).\n                  XRF is a non-invasive\u00a0analytical method capable of detecting chemical elements in\n                  bulk or trace concentrations (parts per\u00a0million level). Following x-ray irradiation\n                  in vivo measurements of certain elements in the human body\u00a0are possible with minimal\n                  radiation dose. For the past three decades the most important medical XRF\u00a0application\n                  was the in vivo measurement of lead (Pb) in the tibia bone. XRF investigations of\n                  the\u00a0distribution, accumulation mechanisms, and metabolic role of other elements such\n                  as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn),\u00a0arsenic (As), selenium (Se), or strontium (Sr) in healthy\n                  and pathological human tissues were also\u00a0pursued by various research groups. I am\n                  particularly interested in the research and development of novel\u00a0in vitro and in vivo\n                  XRF measurement techniques using modern x-ray optics instrumentation and\u00a0techniques.\n                  The microbeam XRF laboratory I built features an integrated x-ray tube and polycapillary\n                  x-\u00a0ray lens capable of producing an x-ray beam with a focal spot of 15 \u03bcm. This XRF\n                  system is suitable for\u00a0in vitro XRF microscopy studies and the research of novel medical\n                  applications in this field.
