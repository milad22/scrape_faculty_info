                "The design and development of efficient TiO2-based, hybrid, nanostructured photocatalysts has recently been receiving substantial attention for environmental remediation due to their excellent physiochemical properties. This article provides an overview of the synthesis strategies and characteristics of the next-generation TiO2-based hybrid photocatalysts, produced in combination with polymers (e.g., polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene) and carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, GO, CNT, carbon quantum dots, carbon nitride). The structural aspects, nanostructure formation process, parameters affecting catalytic activity, photocatalytic mechanisms and photocatalytic applications of TiO2-based catalysts for efficient photocatalytic degradation of gaseous\/volatile organic pollutants in water\/air are reviewed. Further, current research trends, means to increase catalytic performance and future prospects of high \u2026",
                "Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with their edge-bound nanometer-size present distinctive properties owing to quantum confinement and edge effects. We report a facile ultrasonic approach with chemical activation using KOH to prepare activated GQDs or aGQDs enriched with both free and bound edges. Compared to GQDs, the aGQDs we synthesized had enhanced BET surface area by a factor of about six, the photoluminescence intensity by about four and half times and electro-capacitance by a factor of about two. Unlike their non-activated counterparts, the aGQDs having enhanced edge states emit enhanced intense blue luminescence and exhibit electrochemical double layer capacitance greater than that of graphene, activated or not. Apart from their use as part of electrodes in a supercapacitor, the superior luminescence of aGQDs holds potential for use in biomedical imaging and related optoelectronic \u2026",
                "In this paper, a mathematical model is analyzed in order to study the natural convection boundary layer flow along an inverted cone. The shape of nanosize particles on entropy generation with based fluid is considered. Simultaneous effects of porous medium, magnetohydrodynamics, radiation and power law index effects are also taken into account. Hamilton\u2013Crosser model is used for the effective thermal conductivity. The nonlinear coupled equations under the assumption of Boussinesq approximation are solved analytically. The calculations are performed for different governing parameters such as Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, power law index, porosity parameter, radiation parameter and magnetic parameter. The physical interpretations of obtained results are illustrated by graphs and tables. In addition, correlation of Nusselt number and skin friction corresponding to active parameters are also analyzed in \u2026",
                "TiO 2 nanofibers (30\u201350 nm diameter), fabricated by the electro-spinning process, were modified with organo-silane agents via a coupling reaction and were grafted with carbohydrate molecules. The mixture was carbonized to produce a uniform coating of amorphous carbon on the surface of the TiO 2 nanofibers. The TiO 2@ C nanofibers were characterized by high resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic property of the functional TiO 2 and carbon nanocomposite was tested via the decomposition of an organic pollutant. The catalytic activity of the covalently functionalized nanocomposite was found to be significantly enhanced in comparison to unfunctionalized composite and pristine TiO 2 due to the synergistic effect of nanostructured TiO 2 and amorphous carbon bound via covalent \u2026",
                "Free-standing composite films based on graphene\/polyaniline (PANI) nanostructure were synthesized for supercapacitor application. First, polyaniline nanospheres were prepared by microemulsion polymerization, followed by the incorporation of graphene oxide nanosheets by hierarchical organization. The cationic PANI nanospheres were attached to the anionic GO sheets by electrostatic interaction and hierarchical deposition of GO\/PANI nanostructures on a membrane filter via targeted self-assembly. Subsequent in situ chemical reduction of GO using hydroiodic acid produced well-defined graphene\/PANI nanostructures having interpenetrating network with 3D open structure. The in situ GO reduction enabled keeping the hierarchical organization intact. The flexible graphene\/PANI film produced was tested as a supercapacitor electrode using voltammograms and Nyquist analysis. The electro-capacitance of the \u2026",
                "In this study magnetohydrodynamic effect on natural convection heat transfer of Cu\u2013water nanofluid in an enclosure with hot elliptic cylinder is investigated. The governing equations of fluid motion and heat transfer in their vorticity stream function form are used to simulate the nanofluid flow and heat transfer. Control Volume based Finite Element Method (CVFEM) is applied to solve these equations. The effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluid are calculated using the Maxwell\u2013Garnetts (MG) and Brinkman models, respectively. The calculations are performed for different governing parameters such as the Hartmann number, Rayleigh number, nanoparticle volume fraction and inclined angle of inner cylinder. Also a correlation of average Nusselt number corresponding to active parameters is presented. The results indicate that Nusselt number is an increasing function of nanoparticle volume fraction \u2026",
                "Aqueous phase exfoliation was developed for producing high-yield graphene nanosheets from expanded graphite (EG). The process included ultrasonication with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) emulsion in aqueous phase. The high throughput exfoliation process was characterized by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Controlled sonication experiments revealed that optimum exfoliation corresponds to maxima in UV\u2013vis spectra. TEM results showed that the exfoliated graphene comprised nanoflakes having \u2a7d5 layers (\u223c60%) and \u2a7d10 layers for 90% of the product. The potential use of this highly dispersed graphene was demonstrated by one-pot synthesis of graphene\/polymer composite via in situ emulsion polymerization with styrene. The integrated role of SDS included adsorption and exfoliation of graphite, dispersion of graphene \u2026",
                "Injectable penicillin is the recommended treatment for WHO-defined severe pneumonia (lower chest indrawing). If oral amoxicillin proves equally effective, it could reduce referral, admission, and treatment costs. We aimed to determine whether oral amoxicillin and parenteral penicillin were equivalent in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children aged 3\u201359 months.This multicentre, randomised, open-label equivalency study was undertaken at tertiary-care centres in eight developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. Children aged 3\u201359 months with severe pneumonia were admitted for 48 h and, if symptoms improved, were discharged with a 5-day course of oral amoxicillin. 1702 children were randomly allocated to receive either oral amoxicillin (n=857) or parenteral penicillin (n=845) for 48 h. Follow-up assessments were done at 5 and 14 days after enrolment. Primary outcome \u2026",
                "A new model is here proposed to investigate the effects of nano-ferroliquid under the influence of low oscillating over stretchable rotating disk. The basic governing equations are formulated under the effects of magnetic field. The resulting system of partial differential equations is first reduced in non-dimensional form by using proper transformations and then reduced coupled system of differential equations is solved analytically by means of homotopy analysis method (HAM). The physical interpretation of velocity and temperature towards different emerging parameters such as particle concentration and effective magnetization parameter are discussed graphically. The physical parameters such as shear stress at wall, heat transfer rate through wall, boundary layer thickness and volume flow rate in axial direction are also presented in tabular form. Finally a comparison with the existing literature is made as a limiting \u2026",
                "Zinc (Zn) fertilization is an effective agronomic tool for Zn biofortification of wheat for overcoming human Zn deficiency. But it still needs to be evaluated across locations with different management practices and wheat cultivars, since grain Zn concentrations may be significantly affected by locations, cultivars and management.Field experiments were conducted over 3 years with the following four Zn treatments: nil Zn, soil Zn application, foliar Zn application and soil + foliar Zn application to explore the impact of Zn fertilization in Zn biofortification of wheat. The experiments were conducted at a total of 23 experimental site-years in China, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey and Zambia.The results showed that foliar Zn application alone or in combination with soil application, significantly \u2026"
