                "The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,283 new measurements from 899 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as heavy neutrinos, supersymmetric and technicolor particles, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Supersymmetry, Extra Dimensions, Particle Detectors, Probability, and Statistics. Among the 112 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on: Dark Energy, Higgs Boson Physics, Electroweak Model, Neutrino Cross Section Measurements, Monte Carlo Neutrino Generators, Top Quark, Dark Matter, Dynamical Electroweak Symmetry Breaking, Accelerator Physics of Colliders, High-Energy Collider Parameters, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Astrophysical Constants and Cosmological Parameters. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review.

We review the determination of the B K parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four B parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. The latter quantities are an addition compared to the previous review. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for m c and m b (also new \u2026",
                "I develop a diagrammatic method for calculating chiral logarithms in the quenched approximation. While not rigorous, the method is based on physically reasonable assumptions, which can be tested by numerical simulations. The main results are that, at leading order in the chiral expansion,(a) there are no chiral logarithms in quenched f \u03c0, for m u= m d (b) the chiral logarithms in B K and related kaon B parameters are, for m d= m s, the same in the quenched approximation as in the full theory, and (c) for m \u03c0 and the condensate there are extra chiral logarithms due to loops containing the \u03b7\u2032, which lead to a peculiar nonanalytic dependence of these quantities on the bare quark mass. Following the work of Gasser and Leutwyler, I discuss how there is a predictable finite volume dependence associated with each chiral logarithm. I compare the resulting predictions with numerical results: for most quantities the \u2026",
                "We calculate the spectrum of the four ground state hybrid (q qg) nonets, J PC=(0, 1, 2)\u2212+, 1\u2212\u2212, using the MIT bag model to first order in cavity perturbation theory. Quark and gluon self-energies are included by a fit to the s-wave mesons and baryons and to the glueball candidate i (1440). We find a large gluon self-energy which substantially increases our predictions of the glueball and hybrid masses. We discuss the phenomenology of hybrids, including a suggestion that the A 3 (1670) and a second peak at 1850 MeV in the f\u03c0 channel may be mixtures of the isovector q q d-wave state with the q qg s-wave.",

                "We discuss the phase diagram of Wilson fermions in the m 0\u2212 g 2 plane for two-flavor QCD. We argue that, as originally suggested by Aoki, there is a phase in which flavor and parity are spontaneously broken. Recent numerical results on the spectrum of the overlap Hamiltonian have been interpreted as evidence against Aoki\u2019s conjecture. We show that they are in fact consistent with the presence of a flavor-parity broken \u201cAoki phase.\u201d We also show how, as the continuum limit is approached, one can study the lattice theory using the continuum chiral Lagrangian supplemented by additional terms proportional to powers of the lattice spacing. We find that there are two possible phase structures at non-zero lattice spacing:(1) there is an Aoki phase of width \u0394 m 0\u223c a 3 with two massless Goldstone pions;(2) there is no symmetry breaking, and all three pions have an equal non-vanishing mass of order a.
