For temperature T>~ 160 MeV the strangeness abundance saturates during the lifetime (\u223c 10\u2212 23 sec) of the plasma created in high-energy nuclear collisions. The chemical equilibration time for gluons and light quarks is found to be less than 10\u2212 24 sec.",

In this report we describe the current status and develop a dynamical approach in order to describe strange particle formation in nuclear collisions at high energy."
