For temperature T>~ 160 MeV the strangeness abundance saturates during the lifetime (\u223c 10\u2212 23 sec) of the plasma created in high-energy nuclear collisions. The chemical equilibration time for gluons and light quarks is found to be less than 10\u2212 24 sec.",
                "Abundances of strange antibaryons formed in nuclear collisions at above 10 GeV\/A are considered as a most accessible diagnostic tool for the study of the possible formation and physical properties of the quark-gluon plasma phase of hadronic matter. In this report we describe the current status and develop a dynamical approach in order to describe strange particle formation in nuclear collisions at high energy."
