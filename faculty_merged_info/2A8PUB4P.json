                "The European nuclear fusion research community has elaborated a Roadmap to the realisation of fusion energy in which \u2018ITER is the key facility and its success is the most important overarching objective of the programme\u2019[1]. In this overview paper, the contribution of the recent (2014\u20132016) JET experiments with the ITER first wall materials mix (eg [2\u20138]) and the underlying physics understanding with improved diagnostics are reviewed in the context of optimising the ITER Research Plan [9]. Indeed, together with the ITER scenario development for deuterium\u2013tritium (D\u2013T) operation [10\u201312], a strong focus on JET utilization is pursued for addressing ITER needs and developing a sound physics basis for the extrapolation through first principle and integrated modelling (eg [13, 14]), ie such as plasma\u2013wall interaction, disruption mitigation taking benefit of the recent installation of a third disruption mitigation valve, L to \u2026"
