                "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is amplified in 40% of malignant gliomas, and the amplified genes are frequently rearranged. We have characterized the genetic alterations associated with these rearrangements in five malignant gliomas. In one tumor the rearrangement resulted in the deletion of most of the extracytoplasmic domain of the receptor, resulting in a hybrid mRNA between new sequences and the truncated EGFR sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein from this tumor was remarkably similar to that described for several viral erbB oncogenes. Four other tumors were noted to have internal deletions of the EGFR gene. These rearrangements brought about in-frame deletions affecting either of two cysteine-rich domains in the extracytoplasmic portion of the molecule. The clonal nature of these alterations, and the fact that identical alterations were seen in more than \u2026",
                "Primary malignant gliomas from 63 patients were analyzed to determine the relationship between amplification of the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and expression of the corresponding mRNA. Twenty-four tumors were found to have amplified the EGFR gene and amplification of other genes occurred in three additional tumors. Hybridization with synthetic RNA probes was used to quantitate mRNA levels in situ. All 24 tumors with amplification of the EGFR gene had high levels of expression of this gene, while none of the 39 tumors without amplification had increased levels. This shows that, in human gliomas, large increases in the expression of the EGFR gene are invariably associated with alterations in gene structure.",
                "The epidermal growth factor receptor has received much interest as a target for various antineoplastic agents, but a complication is that many normal tissues also express this receptor. We have previously identified in human glial tumors an 801-bp in-frame deletion within the epidermal growth factor receptor gene that created a novel epitope at the junction. By using Western blot assays with a mutant-specific antibody as a rapid and sensitive means for detecting this alteration in primary human tumors, it was found that 57% (26 of 46) of high-grade and 86% (6 of 7) of low-grade glial tumors, but not normal brain, express this protein. This altered receptor was also present in 66% (4 of 6) of pediatric gliomas and 86% (6 of 7) of medulloblastomas, 78% (21 of 27) of breast carcinomas, and 73% (24 of 32) of ovarian carcinomas. The fact that this receptor is frequently found in tumors but not in normal tissue makes it an \u2026",
                "THE protein Grb2 plays a central role in signalling by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases 1, 2, where its SH2 domain binds to the receptor and its two SH3 domains link to effectors. One target effector is SOS, SO Grb2 links receptor protein-tyrosine kinases with the Ras signalling pathway. The SH3 domains can also couple to other signalling proteins, including Vav 3, c-Abl 4 and dynamin 5. We have identified several bands in glial and medullo-blastoma tumours that are recognized by Grb2 but these did not correspond to any known protein. Here we use recombinant Grb2 to isolate a complementary DNA called Gabl (for Grb2-asso-ciated binder-1). Gabl shares amino-acid homology and several structural features with IRS-1 (insulin-receptor substrate-1; refs 6, 7), is a substate of the EGF and insulin receptors, and can act as a docking protein for several SH2-containing proteins. Over-expression of Gabl enhances cell \u2026",
                "A gene, termed gli, was identified that is amplified more than 50-fold in a malignant glioma. The gene is expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line and is located at chromosome 12 position (q13 to q14.3). The gli gene is a member of a select group of cellular genes that are genetically altered in primary human tumors.",
                "Despite molecular biological advances in understanding human cancers, translation into therapy has been less forthcoming; targeting neoplastic cells still requires that tumor-specific markers, preferably those on the cell surface, be identified. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exists in a deletion-mutant form, EGFRvIII, which has been identified by genetic and immunological means in a subset of gliomas and non-small cell lung carcinomas. Specific polyvalent antisera to the extra-cellular portion of the variant were readily induced, but immunization using a synthetic linear peptide representing the unique EGFRvIII primary sequence has been unsuccessful in mice or macaques. We report here five specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed through long-term immunization protocols using the EGFRvIII-specific synthetic peptide and the intact variant in different formats that maintained secondary and \u2026",
                "We have investigated human gliomas that amplify and rearrange the epidermal growth factor receptor gene, with generation of an in-frame deletion mutation of 802 nucleotides in the external domain. This in-frame deletion mutation generates a local amino acid sequence at the fusion junction of what normally were distant polypeptide sequences in the intact epidermal growth factor receptor. This 14-amino acid peptide was chemically synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used as an immunogen in rabbits. The elicited antibody reacted specifically with the fusion peptide in ELISA. The anti-fusion junction peptide antibody was purified by passage of the antiserum over a peptide affinity column with acidic elution. The purified antibody selectively bound the glioma deletion mutant as compared to the intact epidermal growth factor receptor as assessed by immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence \u2026",
                "CD44 is a widely distributed cell surface adhesion molecule and is implicated in diverse biological processes. However, the nature of intracellular signaling triggered by CD44 remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that CD44 undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavage in the ectodomain and intracellular domain, resulting in the release of a CD44 intracellular domain (ICD) fragment. Consequently, CD44ICD acts as a signal transduction molecule, where it translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription mediated through the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate\u2013responsive element, which is found in numerous genes involved in diverse cellular processes. Expression of an uncleavable CD44 mutant as well as metalloprotease inhibitor treatment blocks CD44-mediated transcriptional activation. In search of the underlying mechanism, we have found that CD44ICD potentiates transactivation mediated by the \u2026"
