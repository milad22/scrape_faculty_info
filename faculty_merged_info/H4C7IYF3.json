We use the CLEO III detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) to study the properties of particles composed of b and c quarks. Our specific focus is testing the Standard Model of quarks and leptons, primarily by making precise determinations of its parameters. In addition to contributing to current theoretical progress, these studies are laying the foundation for understanding CP violation and other mysteries of particle physics. With the great success of the asymmetric B factories at KEK and SLAC, we are now proposing to use CLEO III and CESR for intensive studies of charmed particles near threshold and for sensitive probes of strong-interaction phenomena. If approved, the CLEO-c project will run through 2005. Beyond that, our group plans to continue studies of the Standard Model with b quarks at the Fermilab Tevatron with the BTeV experiment.
