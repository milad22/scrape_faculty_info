                " BACKGROUND : There has been continuing prog\u2010 ress in measures to reduce the risk of transfusion\u2010 transmitted infection, including introduction of serologic tests of increased sensitivity and the recent implementation of investigational NAT in small pools of samples. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Data relating to all blood donations to the American Red Cross have been consolidated into a single database. The prevalence of confirmed\u2010positive test results for HBsAg, HCV, HIV, and HTLV were evaluated for each year for first\u2010time donors from 1995 through 2001. Incidence rates for these infections were evaluated among repeat donors having at least two donations in a 2\u2010year period. The frequencies of HIV\u20101 RNA\u2010 and HCV RNA\u2010positive, seronegative donations were assessed for first\u2010time and repeat donations. The relationship risk = (window period) \u00d7 (incidence) was used to assess residual risk among \u2026",
                "In the United States, transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by blood transfusion occurs almost exclusively when a recently infected blood donor is infectious but before antibodies to HIV become detectable (during the \u201cwindow period\u201d). We estimated the risk of HIV transmission caused by transfusion on the basis of the window period associated with the use of current, sensitive enzyme immunosorbent assays and recent data on HIV incidence among blood donors.We analyzed demographic and laboratory data on more than 4.1 million blood donations obtained in 1992 and 1993 in 19 regions served by the American National Red Cross, as well as the results of HIV-antibody tests of 4.9 million donations obtained in an additional 23 regions.We estimated that, in the 19 study regions, 1 donation in every 360,000 (95 percent confidence interval, 210,000 to 1,140,000 \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) was introduced for blood donation screening in the United States in 1999. This study analyzes temporal trends of these two infections since NAT introduction.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donation data from 1999 to 2008 were analyzed; each donation was tested for antibodies and viral RNA for HIV and HCV. Incidence for first\u2010time (FT) donors was derived by multiplying that among repeat (RP) donors by the ratio of NAT yield rates between FT and RP donors. Incidence for all donors was the weighted mean based on percentage of FT and RP donors. Residual risk (RR) was determined using the window\u2010period model.RESULTS: During the 10\u2010year period approximately 66 million donations were screened with 32 HIV (1:2 million) and 244 HCV (1:270,000) NAT yield donations identified. HCV \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND: American Red Cross surveillance data on transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI) fatalities were analyzed to evaluate the association with components from donors with white blood cell (WBC) antibodies and to examine the potential impact of the selective transfusion of plasma from male donors.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Suspected TRALI reports in 2003 through 2005 were identified and all fatalities were reviewed and classified by three physicians as \u201cprobable TRALI\u201d or of \u201cunrelated etiology,\u201d with independent review of the associated serologic investigation. Hospital investigational and reporting biases could not be fully controlled in this retrospective study.RESULTS: A total of 550 reports of suspected TRALI, including 72 fatalities, were investigated. The number of reports increased each year and the rate varied by geographic region. Retrospective review of fatalities revealed 38 \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND: The American Red Cross initiated systemwide bacterial testing of all apheresis platelet (PLT) collections in March 2004, yet continues to receive reports of septic reactions after transfusion of screened components.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The rates of confirmed bacterial contamination of apheresis PLT collections detected by prospective quality control (QC) testing, and by surveillance of reported septic reactions to screened\u2010negative apheresis PLTs, were analyzed according to the technology utilized for collection.RESULTS: Between March 1, 2004, and May 31, 2006, bacterial culture testing was performed on 1,004,206 donations; of these, 186 (1:5,399) had confirmed\u2010positive culture results. Transfusion of all but 1 of the associated 293 components was prevented. A significantly higher rate of confirmed\u2010positive bacterial cultures was seen with products collected utilizing two\u2010arm \u2026",
                "Thirteen years ago, blood centres voluntarily started testing whole blood and platelet apheresis donors using nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT). The first reports on the feasibility of routine blood donation NAT screening were published in 1998\u2044 99, followed by wide-scale implementation or mandated NAT testing in multiple countries over the subsequent several years [1\u20135]. Although studies demonstrated that NAT testing could efficiently detect serologically negative donors who were infected with all three major transfusion-transmitted viruses (HCV, HIV-1 and HBV), most countries initially mandated NAT testing only for HCV or for HCV and HIV-1. Thus, despite the cost and logistical challenges to blood banks that tried to establish NAT testing on a routine basis, HCV and HIV-1 NAT testing expanded rapidly in the early 90s in many countries. The main reasons for the delayed implementation of HBV NAT \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND: A large number of blood donors are deferred each year and many of the temporarily deferred donors do not return to donate blood. This study analyzed actual deferral and return donation data from the American Red Cross to further assess the impact of donor deferral on donor availability.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Voluntary blood donors who presented between 2001 and 2006 were included in this study. Deferred donors were classified into three groups according to their history of presentation during the prior 2 years: Group 1 with no prior donation or deferral, Group 2 with prior donation but no deferral, and Group 3 with prior deferral. Temporarily deferred donors in Groups 1 and 2 who did not return during the next 3 years were considered lost donors. All indefinitely deferred donors were lost donors.RESULTS: A mean of 12.8 percent of a total of 47,814,370 donor presentations \u2026",
                "ContextDonations by minors (16- and 17-year-olds) now account for approximately 8% of the whole blood collected by the American Red Cross, but young age and first-time donation status are known to be independent risk factors for donation-related complications.ObjectiveTo evaluate adverse reactions to allogeneic whole blood donation by 16- and 17-year-olds compared with older donors in American Red Cross blood centers.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective documentation of adverse events among 16- and 17-year-old donors using standardized collection protocols, definitions, and reporting methods in 2006. Data were from 9 American Red Cross blood centers that routinely collect from 16- and 17-year-olds, a population that provides 80% of its donations at high school blood drives.Main Outcome MeasuresRate of systemic (syncopal-type) and phlebotomy-related donor complications per 10 000 \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND: Plasma components from female donors were responsible for most cases of transfusion\u2010related acute lung injury (TRALI) reported to the American Red Cross (ARC) between 2003 and 2005. Consequently, we began preferentially distributing plasma from male donors for transfusion in 2006 and evaluated the effect on reported TRALI cases in the ensuing 2 years.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Suspected TRALI cases reported to the ARC Hemovigilance Program in calendar years (CY) 2006, 2007, and 2008 are described. Any case involving a fatality was also independently reviewed by three ARC physicians and classified as probable TRALI or not TRALI.RESULTS: The percentage of plasma collected from male donors and distributed for transfusion increased each year from 55% in CY2006 to 79% in CY2007 and 95% in CY2008.

                "BACKGROUND: This study used two approaches to estimate the current incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a US donor population.METHODS: HBV incidence was estimated through the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) yield approach and the seroconversion method. Residual risk was estimated by the incidence\u2013window period model. HBsAg yield refers to an HBsAg confirmed\u2010positive, antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (anti\u2010HBc)\u2013nonreactive donation, adjusted for false\u2010positive neutralization results. The number of HBsAg\u2010seroconverting repeat donors divided by total number of person\u2010years of evaluation or the HBsAg yield rate divided by HBsAg yield window gave rise to incidence estimates.RESULTS: The seroconversion and the yield approach, respectively, gave an incidence estimate of 3.41 or 3.43 per 105 person\u2010years. Using a revised infectious window period of 38 or 30 days for current \u2026"
