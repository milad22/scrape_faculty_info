All four compounds exhibit paraelectric\u2212antiferroelectric phase transition behavior in the temperature range 160\u2212185 K (Mn: 185 K, Fe: 160 K; Co: 165 K; Ni: 180 K); this is associated with an order\u2212disorder transition involving the hydrogen bonded dimethylammonium cations. On further cooling, the compounds become canted weak ferromagnets below 40 K. This research opens up a new class of multiferroics in which the electrical ordering is achieved by means of hydrogen bonding.",
                "A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic state of matter in which electrons\u2019 spins are quantum entangled over long distances, but do not show magnetic order in the zero-temperature limit 1. The observation of QSL states is a central aim of experimental physics, because they host collective excitations that transcend our knowledge of quantum matter; however, examples in real materials are scarce 2. Here, we report neutron-scattering experiments on YbMgGaO 4, a QSL candidate in which Yb 3+ ions with effective spin-1\/2 occupy a triangular lattice 3, 4, 5, 6. Our measurements reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations\u2014the essential experimental hallmark of a QSL 7\u2014at very low temperature (0.06 K). The origin of this peculiar excitation spectrum is a crucial question, because isotropic nearest-neighbour interactions do not yield a QSL ground state on the triangular lattice 8.

                "Many correlated electron materials, such as high-temperature superconductors 1, geometrically frustrated oxides 2 and low-dimensional magnets 3, 4, are still objects of fruitful study because of the unique properties that arise owing to poorly understood many-body effects. Heavy-fermion metals 5\u2014materials that have high effective electron masses due to those effects\u2014represent a class of materials with exotic properties, ranging from unusual magnetism, unconventional superconductivity and \u2018hidden\u2019order parameters 6. The heavy-fermion superconductor URu 2 Si 2 has held the attention of physicists for the past two decades owing to the presence of a \u2018hidden-order\u2019phase below 17.5 K. Neutron scattering measurements indicate that the ordered moment is 0.03\u03bc B, much too small to account for the large heat-capacity anomaly at 17.5 K. We present recent neutron scattering experiments that unveil a new piece of \u2026",
                "In recent years, the Ni\u2013Mo\u2013Cr superalloy Hastelloy\u00ae C-276\u2122 has been used as a substrate material for fabricating superconducting tapes such as YBCO and MgB2 coated conductors. With increasing piece length, these coated conductors are within reach of large scale commercial applications. However, data on the physical properties of Hastelloy C-276 at temperatures relevant for these applications are not yet available. In this work, physical properties including magnet succeptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and the Seebeck coefficient are measured from 2to300K and thermal conductivity from 2to200K. Our results show that Hastelloy C-276 exhibits Curie paramagnetism between 4 and 300K with a Curie constant C=0.091K. A spin-glass-like behavior is observed below 3K. The electrical resistivity has a minimum at \u223c12K, and shows a linear weak T dependence at higher temperatures. The specific \u2026",
                "La0.67Ca0.33Mn1\u2212xCuxO3 (x=0 and 0.15) epitaxial thin films were grown on the (100) LaAlO3 substrates, and the temperature dependence of their resistivity was measured in magnetic fields up to 12 T by a four-probe technique. We found that the competition between the ferromagnetic metallic (FM) and paramagnetic insulating (PI) phases plays an important role in the observed colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect. Based on a scenario that the doped manganites approximately consist of phase-separated FM and PI regions, a simple phenomenological model was proposed to describe the CMR effect. Using this model, we calculated the resistivity as functions of temperature and magnetic field. The model not only qualitatively accounts for some main features related to the CMR effect, but also quantitatively agrees with the experimental observations.",
                "The synthesis and characterization of Ba 3 CuSb 2 O 9, which has a layered array of Cu 2+ spins in a triangular lattice, are reported. The magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering experiments of this material show no magnetic ordering down to 0.2 K with a \u03b8 CW=\u2212 55 K. The magnetic specific heat reveals a T-linear dependence with a \u03b3= 43.4 mJ K\u2212 2 mol\u2212 1 below 1.4 K. These observations suggest that Ba 3 CuSb 2 O 9 is a new quantum spin liquid candidate with a S= 1\/2 triangular lattice.",
                "Two new gapless quantum spin-liquid candidates with S= 1 (Ni 2+) moments: the 6 H\u2212 B phase of Ba 3 NiSb 2 O 9 with a Ni 2+-triangular lattice and the 3C phase with a Ni 2\/3 Sb 1\/3-three-dimensional edge-shared tetrahedral lattice were obtained under high pressure. Both compounds show no magnetic order down to 0.35 K despite Curie-Weiss temperatures \u03b8 CW of\u2212 75.5 (6 H\u2212 B) and\u2212 182.5 K (3C), respectively. Below\u223c 25 K, the magnetic susceptibility of the 6 H\u2212 B phase saturates to a constant value \u03c7 0= 0.013 emu\/mol, which is followed below 7 K by a linear-temperature-dependent magnetic specific heat (C M) displaying a giant coefficient \u03b3= 168 mJ\/mol K 2. Both observations suggest the development of a Fermi-liquid-like ground state. For the 3C phase, the C M\u221d T 2 behavior indicates a unique S= 1, 3D quantum spin-liquid ground state.",
                "The microwave-absorbing properties of La1\u2212xSrxMnO3 (x=0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7) powders have been studied in the frequency range of 8\u201312 GHz at room temperature. The optimal absorption can be achieved and microwave loss peak is at 25 dB for x=0.4 sample. Both tan \u03b4e and tan \u03b4m measurements show that the absorption can be attributed to magnetic and dielectric losses. The microwave loss peak corresponds to the maximum dielectric loss tangent tan \u03b4e near 10.5 GHz. The sample having lower resistivity exhibits a larger microwave-absorbing ability, which can be considered as another origin for the microwave absorption.",
                "Two B-site ordered double perovskites, La 2 LiMoO 6 and Ba 2 YMoO 6, based on the S= 1 2 ion, Mo 5+, have been investigated in the context of geometric magnetic frustration. Powder neutron diffraction, heat capacity, susceptibility, muon-spin relaxation (\u03bc SR), and Y 89 NMR-including magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR data have been collected. La 2 LiMoO 6 crystallizes in P 2 1\/n with a= 5.59392 (19) \u00c5, b= 5.69241 (16) \u00c5, c= 7.88029 (22) \u00c5, and \u03b2= 90.2601 (30) at 299.7 K, while Ba 2 YMoO 6 is cubic, F m 3 m, with a= 8.39199 (65) \u00c5 at 297.8 K. Ba 2 YMoO 6 shows no distortion from cubic symmetry even at 2.8 K in apparent violation of the Jahn-Teller theorem for a t 2 g 1 ion. Y 89 NMR MAS data indicate about a 3% level of Y\/Mo site mixing. La 2 LiMoO 6 deviates strongly from simple Curie-Weiss (CW) paramagnetic behavior below 150 K and zero-field-cooled\/field-cooled (ZFC\/FC) irreversibility occurs below \u2026",
                "Using magnetic, thermal, and neutron measurements on single-crystal samples, we show that Ba 3 CoSb 2 O 9 is a spin-1\/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet with the c axis as the magnetic easy axis and two magnetic phase transitions bracketing an intermediate up-up-down phase in magnetic field applied along the c axis. A pronounced extensive neutron-scattering continuum above spin-wave excitations, observed below T N, implies that the system is in close proximity to one of two spin-liquid states that have been predicted for a 2D triangular lattice."
