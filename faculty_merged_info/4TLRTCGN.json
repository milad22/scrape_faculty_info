Emphasis is on the development of systematic low\u00ad-energy expansions in the presence of bound states and resonances. Of particular interest are nuclei, which are the simplest complex structures arising from interactions that lack a small coupling constant. Similarities with cold atom systems near unitarity are also explored. The goal is to predict properties of light nuclei and nuclear matter from the underlying theory of strong interactions, QCD. Nuclear probes of approximate symmetries, such as time reversal, and baryon and lepton numbers, are exploited in the search for interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.
