Her work has focused on the analysis of galaxies properties and their environment to understand their formation and evolution, and on the co-evolution of galaxies and super-massive black holes. She has also done some work on large-scale structures, peculiar motions, QSOs and the Ly-alpha forest. Earlier on in her career she assembled, maintained and analyzed the ENEAR database used for peculiar velocity studies; it is still the only all-sky early-type galaxy database. \u00a0She demonstrated that chemical compositions of early-type galaxies in the ENEAR sample show little dependence on environment. She has been involved with the SDSS for two decades. She is acknowledged as a `Builder' of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). She used the SDSS to assemble and analyze what was at the time the world's largest catalog of early-type galaxies, and used it to demonstrate that velocity dispersion is the key physical parameter which determines galaxy properties. Her work showed that a shift in paradigm was needed: \u00a0minor rather than major mergers must have been an important assembly mechanism for the most massive galaxies. She also published work on the IGM and quasars at intermediate and high redshift. More recently:  Her group produced the UPenn SDSS PhotDec Catalog of all galaxy types in the SDSS survey. \u00a0Among other things, this has led to a substantial upward revision of the world's estimate of the mass in stars in the local universe. Her group identified a new mass scale, 2 x 10^11 Msun, in the galaxy population: \u00a0above this mass, assembly by mergers matters at least as much as in-situ star formation, and the galaxy population becomes dominated by ellipticals which rotate slowly if at all. She and her group were pioneers in the use of Deep Learning techniques to estimate galaxy morphologies directly from the image pixels in galaxy surveys. \u00a0Such algorithms are necessary to turn the next generation of Big Datasets into Big Discoveries. Her group produced two Value Added Catalogs which were included in the official SDSS-IV Data Release 15: the MaNGA PyMorph DR15 photometric catalogue and the MaNGA Morphology Deep Learning DR15 catalogue . \u00a0They used these to illustrate the power of combining reliable photometry and morphological classifications with spatially resolved spectroscopy to explore the slow- and fast-rotator dichotomy. Her group identified an important bias in Jeans-equation estimates of the masses of galaxies. \u00a0Using spatially resolved spectroscopy in the MaNGA survey, they have recently shown that accounting for stellar population gradients lowers the estimated dynamical masses, bringing them into much better agreement with those estimated from the stellar populations. \u00a0This contrasts with the consensus in the prior literature that it was the stellar population estimates which were biased. \u00a0In addition to affecting models of how and why star formation shuts off in massive galaxies, this impacts the constraints that observed galaxy velocity dispersion profiles place on modified gravity models. She and her collaborators identified an important bias in currently available catalogs of super massive black holes. \u00a0Accounting for this bias resolves a number of puzzles associated with the connection between galaxy formation and black hole growth, the relation between quiescent and active galactic nuclei and their host galaxies, as well as gravity wave non-detections.
