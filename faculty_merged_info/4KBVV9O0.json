                "This paper provides an introduction and an overview of the design and behavior of seismic-resistant eccentrically braced frames (EBFs). Within the last ten years, EBFs have become a widely recognized lateral load-resisting system for steel buildings in areas of high seismicity. The primary purpose of this paper is to present design recommendations for links and connections in EBFs. Some basic concepts on the behavior of EBFs are reviewed, and highlights of significant experimental results are presented. The important effects of link length on both the elastic and inelastic response of EBFs under lateral load are emphasized. The paper focuses on EBFs constructed with shear links, as these provide for the maximum stiffness, strength, ductility and energy dissipation capacity of an EBF. Suggested details are provided for links and for selected connections in EBFs.",
                "Steel moment connections reinforced with cover plates have received considerable attention in the US since the Northridge earthquake, both in laboratory testing and in new steel moment frame construction. This paper presents experimental data on 12 large scale connection test specimens reinforced with cover plates. Ten of the 12 test specimens showed excellent performance, developing large plastic rotations under cyclic load. Two test specimens failed, however, indicating that cover plated connections are not fool-proof. This type of connection has limitations that must be considered in design and construction. The paper provides a critical assessment of cover plated connections, identifying potential benefits as well as concerns and limitations. Design implications of the experimental data are discussed.",
                "This paper describes an experimental study on radius cut reduced beam section (RBS) moment connections for use in seismic resistant steel moment frames. The effects of panel zone strength, composite behavior with a concrete slab, and the beam web-to-column flange connection were specifically addressed in these tests. In total, eight double-sided specimens were designed, fabricated, and tested in this study, providing data for sixteen individual RBS connections. Each specimen was subjected to a standard quasi-static cyclic load pattern. Overall, the specimens performed well with seven of the eight achieving total (elastic plus plastic) story drift ratios of at least 0.04 radians in magnitude before experiencing 20% strength degradation. The other test was stopped due to out-of-plane instability after being loaded to 0.03 radians of total story drift. Comparison of the response of specimens with strong panel zones \u2026",
                "Cyclic\u2010loading tests were conducted on eight large\u2010scale welded flange\u2010bolted web steel moment connections. The objective was to investigate the need for supplemental welds on the beam web connection, for beam sections where the web accounts for a substantial portion of the beam's fluxural strength. Such supplemental web welds are currently required by model seismic codes in the United States. Results of the testing program showed highly variable performance among the eight specimens. Plastic rotations developed by the beams prior to connection failure were judged to be poor to marginal for severe seismic applications. All connections failed by fracture at or near the beam\u2010flange groove welds. Variability in the performance of the beam flange groove welds appears to have dominated the response of the specimens. This paper summarizes the test program and compares results to those of previous U \u2026",

                "A total of 23 tests were conducted to study the cyclic loading performance of links in steel eccentrically braced frames. The objectives of these tests were to reevaluate flange slenderness limits and overstrength factors for links. The effect of loading history on link performance was also investigated. Link specimens were constructed from five different wide-flange sections, all of ASTM A992 steel, with various lengths ranging from short shear yielding links to very long flexural yielding links. In addition to providing data on the effects of flange buckling and overstrength, these tests also showed some unexpected failure modes. The paper provides an overview of this experimental investigation, describing the overall research program, as well as details of the test specimens and test results. The paper concludes with a number of design recommendations for links in eccentrically braced frames.",
                "Cyclic loading tests were conducted to study the behavior of link beams in steel eccentrically braced frames. A total of thirty-seven link specimens were constructed from five different wide-flange sections, all of ASTM A992 steel, with link length varying from short shear yielding links to long flexure yielding links. The occurrence of web fracture in shear yielding link specimens led to further study on the cause of these fractures. Since the link web fracture appeared to be a phenomenon unique to modern rolled shapes, the potential role of material properties on these fractures is discussed. Based on the test data, a change in the flange slenderness limit is proposed. The link overstrength factor of 1.5, as assumed in the current U.S. code provisions, appears to be reasonable. The cyclic loading history used for testing was found to significantly affect link performance. Test observations also suggest new techniques for link \u2026"
