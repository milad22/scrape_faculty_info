                "Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics introduces students, scientists, and engineers to the full range of activity in the rapidly growing field on nonlinear dynamics. Using a step-by-step introduction to dynamics and geometry in state space as the central focus of understanding nonlinear dynamics, thisbook includes a thorough treatment of both differential equation models and iterated map models (including a derivation of the famous Feigenbaum numbers). It is the only book at this level to include the increasingly important field of pattern formation and a survey of the controversial questions ofquantum chaos. Important tools such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions are treated in detail. With over 200 figures and diagrams, and analytic and computer exercises for every chapter, the book can be used as a course-text or for self-instruction. This second edition has been restructuredto make the book even more useful as a course text: many of the more complex examples and derivations have been moved to appendices. The extensive collection of annotated references has been updated through January 2000 and now includes listings of World Wide Web sites at many of the major nonlineardynamics research centers. From reviews on the 1\/e:'What has been lacking is a single book that takes the reader with nothing but a knowledge of elementary calculus and physics all the way to the frontiers of research in chaos and nonlinear dynamics in all its facets.[...] a serious student, teacher, or researcher would be delighted to have this book on the shelf as a reference and as a window to the literature in this exciting and rapidly growing new field of \u2026",
                "Experimental observations and numerical simulations of the large force inhomogeneities present in stationary bead packs are presented. Forces much larger than the mean occurred but were exponentially rare. An exactly soluble model reproduced many aspects of the experiments and simulations. In this model, the fluctuations in the force distribution arise because of variations in the contact angles and the constraints imposed by the force balance on each bead in the pile.",
                "This review describes recent groundbreaking results in Si, Si\/SiGe, and dopant-based quantum dots, and it highlights the remarkable advances in Si-based quantum physics that have occurred in the past few years. This progress has been possible thanks to materials development of Si quantum devices, and the physical understanding of quantum effects in silicon. Recent critical steps include the isolation of single electrons, the observation of spin blockade, and single-shot readout of individual electron spins in both dopants and gated quantum dots in Si. Each of these results has come with physics that was not anticipated from previous work in other material systems. These advances underline the significant progress toward the realization of spin quantum bits in a material with a long spin coherence time, crucial for quantum computation and spintronics.",
                "We study theoretically the complex network of forces that is responsible for the static structure and properties of granular materials. We present detailed calculations for a model in which the fluctuations in the force distribution arise because of variations in the contact angles and the constraints imposed by the force balance on each bead of the pile. We compare our results for the force distribution function for this model, including exact results for certain contact angle probability distributions, with numerical simulations of force distributions in random sphere packings. This model reproduces many aspects of the force distribution observed both in experiment and in numerical simulations of sphere packings. Our model is closely related to some that have been studied in the context of self-organized criticality. We present evidence that in the force distribution context,\" critical\" power-law force distributions occur only when \u2026",
                "Free magnetic moments usually manifest themselves in Curie laws, where weak external magnetic fields produce magnetizations that vary as the reciprocal of the temperature (1\/T). For a variety of materials that do not display static magnetism, including doped semiconductors 1 and certain rare-earth intermetallics 2, the 1\/T law is replaced by a power law T-\u03b1 with \u03b1< 1. Here we show that a much simpler material system\u2014namely, the insulating magnetic salt LiHo x Y 1-x F 4\u2014can also display such a power law. Moreover, by comparing the results of numerical simulations of this system with susceptibility and specific-heat data 3, we show that both energy-level splitting and quantum entanglement are crucial to describing its behaviour. The second of these quantum mechanical effects\u2014entanglement, where the wavefunction of a system with several degrees of freedom cannot be written as a product of wavefunctions \u2026",
                "The stability of weakly incommensurate two-dimensional solid phases described by periodic arrays of discommensurations has been investigated. It is shown that incommensurate phases consisting of a small number of possible commensurate domains of either the striped or honeycomb type are unstable with respect to the spontaneous creation of dislocations. Such phases are consequently\" liquids,\" with exponential decay of correlations. The consequences of these results on the phase diagram of overlayers and the relation with experiment is discussed.",
                "Now that it is possible to achieve measurement and control fidelities for individual quantum bits (qubits) above the threshold for fault tolerance, attention is moving towards the difficult task of scaling up the number of physical qubits to the large numbers that are needed for fault-tolerant quantum computing 1, 2. In this context, quantum-dot-based spin qubits could have substantial advantages over other types of qubit owing to their potential for all-electrical operation and ability to be integrated at high density onto an industrial platform 3, 4, 5. Initialization, readout and single-and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in various quantum-dot-based qubit representations 6, 7, 8, 9. However, as seen with small-scale demonstrations of quantum computers using other types of qubit 10, 11, 12, 13, combining these elements leads to challenges related to qubit crosstalk, state leakage, calibration and control hardware \u2026",

                "Nanofabricated quantum bits permit large-scale integration but usually suffer from short coherence times due to interactions with their solid-state environment 1. The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that it minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si\/SiGe quantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by resonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from a local micromagnet 2, and the spin state is read out in the single-shot mode 3. Electron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we attribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in silicon, a Ramsey decay timescale of 1 \u03bcs is observed, almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic timescales in GaAs quantum dots 4, 5, whereas gate operation \u2026",
                "This paper reviews a class of generic dissipative dynamical systems called N-K models. In these models, the dynamics of N elements, defined as Boolean variables, develop step by step, clocked by a discrete time variable. Each of the N Boolean elements at a given time is given a value which depends upon K elements in the previous time step. We review the work of many authors on the behavior of the models, looking particularly at the structure and lengths of their cycles, the sizes of their basins of attraction, and the flow of information through the systems. In the limit of infinite N, there is a phase transition between a chaotic and an ordered phase, with a critical phase in between. We argue that the behavior of this system depends significantly on the topology of the network connections. If the elements are placed upon a lattice with dimension d,the system shows correlations related to the standard percolation \u2026"
