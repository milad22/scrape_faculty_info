                "Using a sample of UK wire makers (N= 282), the authors tested a model in which personality and work environment antecedents affect proactive work behavior via cognitive-motivational mechanisms. Self-reported proactive work behaviors (proactive idea implementation and proactive problem solving) were validated against rater assessments for a subsample (n= 60) of wire makers. With the exception of supportive supervision, each antecedent was important, albeit through different processes. Proactive personality was significantly associated with proactive work behavior via role breadth self-efficacy and flexible role orientation, job autonomy was also linked to proactive behavior via these processes, as well as directly; and coworker trust was associated with proactive behavior via flexible role orientation. In further support of the model, the cognitive-motivational processes for proactive work behavior differed from \u2026",
                "This study investigated the determinants of team proactive performance amongst 43 shift teams from a UK chemical processing plant. Using external ratings of team proactive performance, the study found that the most proactive teams were those with higher levels of self\u2010management, transformational team leaders, and a higher\u2010than\u2010average level of proactive personality. The relationship between transformational leadership and team proactive performance was mediated by favourable interpersonal norms. In addition, lower diversity of proactive personality amongst team members had an indirect association with team proactive performance via its negative effect on favourable interpersonal norms.",
                "The authors investigate the relationship between employee perceptions of surface- and deep-level dissimilarity and within-team perspective taking. Results suggest that the more dissimilar employees perceive themselves to be from their fellow team members in terms of their work style, the less their perspective taking (i.e., lower positive attributions and empathy). In addition, the authors found that perceived work-style dissimilarity interacted with a contextually salient surface-level attribute (perceived age dissimilarity) such that when perceived work-style dissimilarity was low, perceived age dissimilarity had a stronger negative effect on within-team perspective taking. This study demonstrates the importance of considering perspective taking in their understanding of the effects of dissimilarity within teams and furthers theoretical understanding of the effects of relational demography by testing competing theories \u2026",
                "This article conceptualizes public service ethos as a multidimensional construct and develops a framework that explains first, why individuals are motivated by this ethos (Public Service Belief); second, how they deliver public services in accordance with this ethos (Public Service Practice); and third, what ends they perceive it to endorse (Public Interest). Despite considerable interest in public service ethos within the public administration literature, research is constrained by the absence of a measure of this ethos. This article therefore reports three studies conducted to advance theory and research through the development of a psychometrically sound instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates support for a three-factor structure, where the dimensions are distinct but related aspects of public service ethos. Moreover, findings show this measure to be valid, reliable, and generalizable. As such it offers \u2026",
                "Research examining relations between work group diversity and outcome measures often relies on diversity scores that are calculated on the basis of individual responses to organizational surveys. When employees fail to respond to a survey, however, the resultant diversity score representing their group will be somewhat distorted. The authors conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the extent to which correlations between group diversity scores (derived from continuous or categorical variables) and outcome variables were attenuated by various forms of random and systematic participant nonresponse. Results indicate that random nonresponse, and many forms of systematic nonresponse, substantially attenuate mean observed correlations.",
                "Public services worldwide have been subject to externally imposed reforms utilizing tools such as financial incentives and performance targets. The adverse impact of such reforms on a public service ethos has been claimed, but rarely demonstrated. Individuals within organizations work beyond their formal contracts of employment, described as Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB), to further organizational interests. Given New Public Management reform and the subsequent contextual changes in the way in which public sector organizations are managed and funded, the present study theorizes that OCB directed towards the organization may be \u2018crowded-out\u2019. This article tests the relationships between public service ethos and OCB and it presents empirical evidence from a study in England (n = 433) of the ability of each dimension of this ethos to predict OCB.",
                "Reviewing research on diversity and relational demography in teams and work groups, the authors compare different ways of measuring gender composition and demonstrate that existing practice can be theoretically biased. The authors conclude that within group-level analyses, the proportion of women should be used; whereas within individual-level analyses, the appropriate approach depends on whether a gender-by-gender composition interaction effect is found. The generalizability of this approach to other types of diversity is also discussed.",
                "Despite the Enneagram Personality Typology growing in popularity within the workplace, little research has focused in it. The aims of this study were therefore twofold. First, to establish how the Enneagram Personality Typology relates to personality approaches that are more established within the research literature and second, to explore the relationship between Enneagram types and key workplace attitudes and cognitions. In doing so, the study is the first investigation into the validity and utility of the Enneagram model as a typology approach to personality in the workplace. Four hundred and sixteen participants, the majority in full time employment, completed a questionnaire survey assessing personality (Enneagram type, Big Five traits, personal values, implicit motives) and work-related variables (job attitudes and cognitions and occupational demographics). Enneagram types were distinguished using a unique \u2026",
                "This paper focuses on the attitudes of learning professionals towards New Public Management (NPM). In a survey of the UK further education sector (n = 433), NPM beliefs were found to be positively associated with both affective and normative organisational commitment. However, as expected, NPM beliefs were not found to be related to continuance organisational commitment. The results also show that although perceived organisational support mediates the relationship between NPM beliefs and affective organisational comment, it is only a partial mediator of the relationship between NPM beliefs and normative organisational commitment. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings, and potential directions for future research, are discussed.",
                "Successful postgraduate supervision is often dependent upon the quality of the relationship between postgraduates and their supervisors. This article reports on two studies that focus on grateful affect and grateful expression within low\u2010 and high\u2010trust postgraduate\u2013supervisor working relationships. In Study 1, a sample of Canadian postgraduates and supervisors was interviewed to explore the consequences of expressed gratitude and identify supervisory behaviors for which postgraduates are grateful. In Study 2, a sample of Australian postgraduates was surveyed. Results showed that perceptions of supervisors\u2019 altruism and the perceived value of supervisors\u2019 behaviors were positively related to the grateful affect felt by postgraduates in low\u2010trust working relationships. In contrast, perceptions of supervisors\u2019 altruism and the perceived value of supervisors\u2019 behaviors were not related to grateful affect in high\u2010trust \u2026"
