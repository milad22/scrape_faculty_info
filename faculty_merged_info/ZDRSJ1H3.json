Excitation, measurement, modeling, and control of sound fields.  Transducers, active control of sound and vibration, energy-based acoustics, and acoustical measurements. Tim Leishman received a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics from Brigham Young University in 1990 and a Ph.D. in acoustics from Penn State University in 2000. \u00a0His research at Penn State focused on active control of sound transmission through partitions. \u00a0Before, during, and after his formal education, he worked in industry as an audio systems specialist, loudspeaker designer, acoustical consultant, and audio acoustics researcher. \u00a0Between 1992 and 1996, and periodically to the present, he has worked as an independent audio and architectural acoustics consultant. \u00a0From 1997 to 2000 he was a senior acoustical researcher for Crown International and the Crown Audio division of Harman International. \u00a0From 2000 to the present, he has been a professor and researcher at BYU. \u00a0He enjoys sharing his experience and enthusiasm for audio and acoustics with his students. \u00a0He has mentored many graduate and undergraduate students who are now employed as researchers, university professors, acoustical consultants, loudspeaker designers, headphone designers, audio system designers, hearing aid designers, acoustic systems engineers, noise and vibration control engineers, acoustic signal processing specialists, software developers, and entrepreneurs."
