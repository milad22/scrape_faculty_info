                "For centuries, practitioners of origami (\u2018ori\u2019, fold;\u2018kami\u2019, paper) and kirigami (\u2018kiru\u2019, cut) have fashioned sheets of paper into beautiful and complex three-dimensional structures. Both techniques are scalable, and scientists and engineers are adapting them to different two-dimensional starting materials to create structures from the macro-to the microscale 1, 2. Here we show that graphene 3, 4, 5, 6 is well suited for kirigami, allowing us to build robust microscale structures with tunable mechanical properties. The material parameter crucial for kirigami is the F\u00f6ppl\u2013von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n number 7, 8 \u03b3: an indication of the ratio between in-plane stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, with high numbers corresponding to membranes that more easily bend and crumple than they stretch and shear. To determine \u03b3, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene monolayers that are 10\u2013100 micrometres in size and obtain a value \u2026",
                "When two sheets of graphene are stacked at a small twist angle, the resulting flat superlattice minibands are expected to strongly enhance electron-electron interactions. Here, we present evidence that near three-quarters (34) filling of the conduction miniband, these enhanced interactions drive the twisted bilayer graphene into a ferromagnetic state. In a narrow density range around an apparent insulating state at 34, we observe emergent ferromagnetic hysteresis, with a giant anomalous Hall (AH) effect as large as 10.4 kilohms and indications of chiral edge states. Notably, the magnetization of the sample can be reversed by applying a small direct current. Although the AH resistance is not quantized, and dissipation is present, our measurements suggest that the system may be an incipient Chern insulator.",
                "Synchronization, the emergence of spontaneous order in coupled systems, is of fundamental importance in both physical and biological systems. We demonstrate the synchronization of two dissimilar silicon nitride micromechanical oscillators, that are spaced apart by a few hundred nanometers and are coupled through an optical cavity radiation field. The tunability of the optical coupling between the oscillators enables one to externally control the dynamics and switch between coupled and individual oscillation states. These results pave a path toward reconfigurable synchronized oscillator networks.",
                "We simulated the behavior of suspended carbon nanotube resonators over a broad range of temperatures to explore the physics of semiflexible polymers in underdamped environments. We find that thermal fluctuations induce strong coupling between resonance modes. This effect leads to spectral fluctuations that readily account for the experimentally observed quality factors Q \u223c 100 at 300 K. Using a mean-field approach to describe fluctuations, we analytically calculate Q and frequency shifts in tensioned and buckled carbon nanotubes and find excellent agreement with simulations.",
                "This paper investigates the influence of magneto-centrifugally driven or simply magnetic winds of rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized T Tauri stars in causing the inward or outward migration of close-in giant planets. The azimuthal ram pressure of the magnetized wind acting on the planet tends to increase the planet's angular momentum and cause outward migration if the star's rotation period P* is less than the planet's orbital period Pp. In the opposite case, P* > Pp, the planet migrates inward. Thus, planets orbiting at distances larger (smaller) than 0.06 au (P*\/5 d)2\/3 tend to be pushed outward (inward), where P* is the rotation period of the star assumed to have the mass of the Sun. The magnetic winds are likely to occur in T Tauri stars where the thermal speed of the gas close to the star is small, where the star's magnetic field is strong, and where the star rotates rapidly. The time-scale for appreciable radial \u2026",
                "Ballistic electrons in solids can have mean free paths far larger than the smallest features patterned by lithography. This has allowed development and study of solid-state electron-optical devices such as beam splitters and quantum point contacts, which have informed our understanding of electron flow and interactions. Recently, high-mobility graphene has emerged as an ideal two-dimensional semimetal that hosts unique chiral electron-optical effects due to its honeycomb crystalline lattice. However, this chiral transport prevents the simple use of electrostatic gates to define electron-optical devices in graphene. Here we present a method of creating highly collimated electron beams in graphene based on collinear pairs of slits, with absorptive sidewalls between the slits. By this method, we achieve beams with angular width 18 or narrower, and transmission matching classical ballistic predictions.",
                "The field of miniature mechanical oscillators is rapidly evolving, with emerging applications including signal processing, biological detection 1 and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics 2. As the dimensions of a mechanical oscillator shrink to the molecular scale, such as in a carbon nanotube resonator 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, their vibrations become increasingly coupled and strongly interacting 8, 9 until even weak thermal fluctuations could make the oscillator nonlinear 10, 11, 12, 13. The mechanics at this scale possesses rich dynamics, unexplored because an efficient way of detecting the motion in real time is lacking. Here we directly measure the thermal vibrations of a carbon nanotube in real time using a high-finesse micrometre-scale silicon nitride optical cavity as a sensitive photonic microscope. With the high displacement sensitivity of 700 fm Hz\u2212 1\/2 and the fine time resolution of this technique, we were able to \u2026",
                "We combine suspended carbon nanotube transistors with optical trapping techniques and scanning photocurrent microscopy to investigate the motion of suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes in solution. We study the movement of nanotubes by monitoring their photocurrent images and measure their thermal fluctuations by imaging microbeads that are tightly attached to nanotubes by single-stranded DNA. By analyzing their thermal fluctuations, we are able to obtain the torsional and bending stiffness of nanotubes and then calculate their diameters. We can also measure, with subangstrom resolution, the effective attachment point of the microbead to the nanotube.",
                "We present a resist-free patterning technique to form electrically contacted graphene nanochannels via localized burning by a pulsed white light source. The technique uses end-point detection to stop the burning process at a fixed resistance to produce channels with resistances of 10\u2009k\u03a9 to 100\u2009k\u03a9. Folding of the graphene sheet takes place during patterning, which provides very straight edges as identified by AFM and SEM. Electrical transport measurements for the nanochannels show a non-linear behavior of the current vs source-drain voltage as the resistance goes above 20\u2009k\u03a9 indicating conduction tunneling effects. Electrochemical gating was performed to further electrically characterize the constrictions produced. The method described can be interesting not only for fundamental studies correlating edge folded structures with electrical transport but also as a promising path for fabricating graphene devices \u2026",
                "We couple magnetic tweezer techniques with standard lithography methods to make magnetically actuated single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) devices. Parallel arrays of 4\u201310 \u03bcm-long SWNT cantilevers are patterned with one end anchored to the substrate and the other end attached to a micron-scale iron magnetic tag that is free to move in solution. Thermal fluctuations of this tag provide a direct measurement of the spring constant of the SWNT cantilevers, yielding values of 10\u20137\u201310\u20138 N\/m. This tag is also a handle for applying forces and torques using externally applied magnetic field gradients. These techniques provide a platform on which interaction forces between SWNTs and other objects such as biomolecules and cells can be measured in situ."
