                "Background\/Aim: The efficacy of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in the treatment of liver cell injury has been demonstrated in several experimental models. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AdoMet treatment in human alcoholic liver cirrhosis.Methods: A randomized, double-blind trial was performed in 123 patients treated with AdoMet (1200 mg\/day, orally) or placebo for 2 years. All patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, and histologic confirmation of the diagnosis was available in 84% of the cases. Seventy-five patients were in Child class A, 40 in class B, and 8 in class C. Sixty-two patients received AdoMet and 61 received placebo.Results: At inclusion into the trial no significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to sex, age, previous episodes of major complications of cirrhosis, Child classification and liver function tests. The overall mortality\/liver transplantation at the end \u2026",
                "Data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration, Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than \u223c6 \u00d7 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than \u223c75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuz\u2019min effect). The angular scale of the correlation \u2026",
                "La enfermedad renal cr\u00f3nica (ERC) es un importante problema de salud p\u00fablica que puede afectar en sus diferentes estadios a cerca del 10% de la poblaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola y que supone una elevada morbimortalidad, as\u00ed como un importante consumo de recursos al Sistema Nacional de Salud. Diez sociedades cient\u00edficas involucradas en el manejo del paciente renal nos hemos puesto de acuerdo para hacer una puesta al d\u00eda del anterior documento de consenso sobre ERC de 2007. El presente es la edici\u00f3n abreviada del documento general extenso, que puede ser consultado en las p\u00e1ginas Web de cada una de las sociedades firmantes. Contiene los siguientes aspectos: definici\u00f3n, epidemiolog\u00eda y factores de riesgo de la ERC; criterios de diagn\u00f3stico, evaluaci\u00f3n y estadificaci\u00f3n de la ERC, albuminuria y estimaci\u00f3n del filtrado glomerular; concepto y factores de progresi\u00f3n; criterios de derivaci\u00f3n a nefrolog\u00eda \u2026",
                "The presence of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment and their potential effects on living organisms has become an issue of growing concern. Among emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals may enter the aquatic environment due to their high consumption and their incomplete removal in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).The main goal of this study was the assessment of the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals found in municipal wastewater of a coastal WWTP (Castell-Platja d\u2019Aro, Spain) using an integrated pilot scale membrane system (MBR\u2013RO).Twenty multiple-class pharmaceuticals (including psychiatric drugs, macrolide antibiotics, \u03b2-blockers, sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, histamine H2 receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatories, nitroimidazole, \u03b2-agonist and antiplatelet agent) were measured in real influent with the lowest average concentration \u2026"
