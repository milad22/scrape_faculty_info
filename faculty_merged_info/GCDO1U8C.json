                "Background\/Aim: The efficacy of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in the treatment of liver cell injury has been demonstrated in several experimental models. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AdoMet treatment in human alcoholic liver cirrhosis.Methods: A randomized, double-blind trial was performed in 123 patients treated with AdoMet (1200 mg\/day, orally) or placebo for 2 years. All patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, and histologic confirmation of the diagnosis was available in 84% of the cases. Seventy-five patients were in Child class A, 40 in class B, and 8 in class C. Sixty-two patients received AdoMet and 61 received placebo.Results: At inclusion into the trial no significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to sex, age, previous episodes of major complications of cirrhosis, Child classification and liver function tests. The overall mortality\/liver transplantation at the end \u2026",
                "Data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration, Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than \u223c6 \u00d7 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than \u223c75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuz\u2019min effect). The angular scale of the correlation \u2026",

                "The presence of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment and their potential effects on living organisms has become an issue of growing concern. Among emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals may enter the aquatic environment due to their high consumption and their incomplete removal in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).The main goal of this study was the assessment of the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals found in municipal wastewater of a coastal WWTP (Castell-Platja d\u2019Aro, Spain) using an integrated pilot scale membrane system (MBR\u2013RO).Twenty multiple-class pharmaceuticals (including psychiatric drugs, macrolide antibiotics, \u03b2-blockers, sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, histamine H2 receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatories, nitroimidazole, \u03b2-agonist and antiplatelet agent) were measured in real influent with the lowest average concentration \u2026"

                "Juana Moreno Associate Professor of Physics Ph.D., 1997 - Rutgers University 293 Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-7586-Office moreno@phys.lsu.edu In my research, I have focussed on the experimentally relevant transport and magnetic\n                  properties of correlated electron systems, including diluted magnetic semiconductors,\n                  heavy fermion compounds and low-dimensional systems. These materials share in common\n                  unexpected properties which can not been explained with conventional approaches. Computer simulations are an increasingly efficient means to study correlated systems.\n                  In my research I have used a variety of computational tools, such as the dynamical\n                  mean-field theory and the dynamical cluster approximation in the study of diluted\n                  magnetic semiconductors and the density matrix renormalization group method in the\n                  area of low-dimensional materials. In the near future, I plan to extend these investigations to nanoscale quantum dots\n                  and heterostructures of magnetic semiconductors, where the confined geometry plays\n                  a crucial role, to incorporate orbital degrees of freedom in the modeling of heavy-fermions\n                  and cuprates, to calculate transport properties in nano systems and to simulate complex\n                  materials quantitatively using parameters extracted from first principles calculations.
