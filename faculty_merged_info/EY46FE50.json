                "The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) is one of three focal plane instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. IRAC is a four\u2010channel camera that obtains simultaneous broadband images at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm. Two nearly adjacent   fields of view in the focal plane are viewed by the four channels in pairs (3.6 and 5.8 \u03bcm; 4.5 and 8 \u03bcm). All four detector arrays in the camera are   pixels in size, with the two shorter wavelength channels using InSb and the two longer wavelength channels using Si:As IBC detectors. IRAC is a powerful survey instrument because of its high sensitivity, large field of view, and four\u2010color imaging. This paper summarizes the in\u2010flight scientific, technical, and operational performance of IRAC."
