                "We report on four radio-detected cosmic-ray (CR) or CR-like events observed with the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), a NASA-sponsored long-duration balloon payload. Two of the four were previously identified as stratospheric CR air showers during the ANITA-I flight. A third stratospheric CR was detected during the ANITA-II flight. Here, we report on characteristics of these three unusual CR events, which develop nearly horizontally, 20\u201330 km above the surface of Earth. In addition, we report on a fourth steeply upward-pointing ANITA-I CR-like radio event which has characteristics consistent with a primary that emerged from the surface of the ice. This suggests a possible \u03c4-lepton decay as the origin of this event, but such an interpretation would require significant suppression of the standard model \u03c4-neutrino cross section.",
                "The Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC) is a low pressure (75 Torr CF 4) 10 liter detector capable of measuring the vector direction of nuclear recoils with the goal of directional dark matter detection. In this Letter we present the first dark matter limit from DMTPC from a surface run at MIT. In an analysis window of 80\u2013200 keV recoil energy, based on a 35.7 g-day exposure, we set a 90% CL upper limit on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross section of 2.0\u00d7 10\u2212 33 cm 2 for 115 GeV\/c 2 dark matter particle mass.",
                "We report on an upward traveling, radio-detected cosmic-ray-like impulsive event with characteristics closely matching an extensive air shower. This event, observed in the third flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), a NASA-sponsored long-duration balloon payload, is consistent with a similar event reported in a previous flight. These events could be produced by the atmospheric decay of an upward-propagating \u03c4 lepton produced by a \u03bd \u03c4 interaction, although their relatively steep arrival angles create tension with the standard model neutrino cross section. Each of the two events have a posteriori background estimates of\u2272 10\u2212 2 events. If these are generated by \u03c4-lepton decay, then either the charged-current \u03bd \u03c4 cross section is suppressed at EeV energies, or the events arise at moments when the peak flux of a transient neutrino source was much larger than the typical expected cosmogenic \u2026",
                "The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna, a NASA long-duration balloon payload, searches for radio emission from interactions of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos in polar ice. The third flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna was launched in December 2014 and completed a 22-day flight. We present the results of three analyses searching for Askaryan radio emission of neutrino origin. In the most sensitive of the analyses, we find one event in the signal region on an expected background of 0. 7\u2212 0.3+ 0.5. Though consistent with the background estimate, the event remains compatible with a neutrino hypothesis even after additional postunblinding scrutiny.",
                "High-energy cosmic neutrinos carry unique information about the most energetic non-thermal sources in the Universe. This white paper describes the outstanding astrophysics questions that neutrino astronomy can address in the coming decade. A companion white paper discusses how the observation of cosmic neutrinos can address open questions in fundamental physics. Detailed measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux, measurements of neutrinos from point sources, and multi-messenger observations with neutrinos will enable the discovery and characterization of the most energetic sources in the Universe.",
                "The measurement of the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils is a compelling but technologically challenging strategy to provide an unambiguous signature of the detection of Galactic dark matter. Most directional detectors aim to reconstruct the dark-matter-induced nuclear recoil tracks, either in gas or solid targets. The main challenge with directional detection is the need for high spatial resolution over large volumes, which puts strong requirements on the readout technologies. In this paper we review the various detector readout technologies used by directional detectors. In particular, we summarize the challenges, advantages and drawbacks of each approach, and discuss future prospects for these technologies.",
                "Recently, the ANITA collaboration reported on two upward-going extensive air shower events consistent with a primary particle that emerges from the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet. These events may be of \u03bd \u03c4 origin, in which the neutrino interacts within the Earth to produce a \u03c4 lepton that emerges from the Earth, decays in the atmosphere, and initiates an extensive air shower. In this paper we estimate an upper bound on the ANITA acceptance to a diffuse \u03bd \u03c4 flux detected via \u03c4-lepton-induced air showers within the bounds of standard model uncertainties. By comparing this estimate with the acceptance of Pierre Auger Observatory and IceCube and assuming standard model interactions, we conclude that a \u03bd \u03c4 origin of these events would imply a neutrino flux at least two orders of magnitude above current bounds.",
                "The ANtarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) NASA long-duration balloon payload completed its fourth flight in December 2016, after 28 days of flight time. ANITA is sensitive to impulsive broadband radio emission from interactions of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos in polar ice (Askaryan emission). We present the results of two separate blind analyses searching for signals from Askaryan emission in the data from the fourth flight of ANITA. The more sensitive analysis, with a better expected limit, has a background estimate of 0.64\u2212 0.45+ 0.69 and an analysis efficiency of 82\u00b12%. The second analysis has a background estimate of 0.34\u2212 0.16+ 0.66 and an analysis efficiency of 71\u00b16%. Each analysis found one event in the signal region, consistent with the background estimate for each analysis. The resulting limit further tightens the constraints on the diffuse flux of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos at energies above 1 0 19 \u2026",
                "The Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC) collaboration is developing a low pressure gas TPC for detecting Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)-nucleon interactions. Optical readout with CCD cameras allows for the detection of the daily modulation of the direction of the dark matter wind. In order to reach sensitivities required for WIMP detection, the detector needs to minimize backgrounds from electron recoils. This paper demonstrates that a simplified CCD analysis achieves 7.3\u00d7 10\u2212 5 rejection of electron recoils while a charge analysis yields an electron rejection factor of 3.3\u00d7 10\u2212 4 for events with 241 Am-equivalent ionization energy loss between 40 keV and 200 keV. A combined charge and CCD analysis yields a background-limited upper limit of 1.1\u00d7 10\u2212 5 (90% confidence level) for the rejection of \u03b3 and electron events. Backgrounds from alpha decays from the field cage are \u2026",
                "The ANITA experiment, which is designed to detect ultrahigh-energy neutrinos, has reported the observation of two anomalous events, directed at angles of 27 and 35 with respect to the horizontal. At these angles, the Earth is expected to efficiently absorb ultrahigh-energy neutrinos, making the origin of these events unclear and motivating explanations involving physics beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we consider the possibility that ANITA\u2019s anomalous events are the result of Askaryan emission produced by exotic weakly interacting particles scattering elastically with nuclei in the Antarctic ice sheet. Such particles could be produced by superheavy (approximately 10 10\u201310 13 GeV) dark matter particles decaying in the halo of the Milky Way. Such scenarios can be constrained by existing measurements of the high-latitude gamma-ray background and the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum, along with \u2026"
