                "The CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) is used to study photo-and electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions by providing efficient detection of neutral and charged particles over a good fraction of the full solid angle. A collaboration of about 30 institutions has designed, assembled, and commissioned CLAS in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The CLAS detector is based on a novel six-coil toroidal magnet which provides a largely azimuthal field distribution. Trajectory reconstruction using drift chambers results in a momentum resolution of 0.5% at forward angles. Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters provide good particle identification. Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of 10 34 nucleon cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. These capabilities are being used in a broad experimental program to study the \u2026",
                "In an exclusive measurement of the reaction \u03b3 d\u2192 K+ K\u2212 p n, a narrow peak that can be attributed to an exotic baryon with strangeness S=+ 1 is seen in the K+ n invariant mass spectrum. The peak is at 1.542\u00b10.005 G e V\/c 2 with a measured width of 0.021 G e V\/c 2 FWHM, which is largely determined by experimental mass resolution. The statistical significance of the peak is (5.2\u00b10.6) \u03c3. The mass and width of the observed peak are consistent with recent reports of a narrow S=+ 1 baryon by other experimental groups.",
                "The analysis and results are presented from the complete data set recorded at Palo Verde between September 1998 and July 2000. In the experiment, the \u03bd e interaction rate has been measured at a distance of 750 and 890 m from the reactors of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station for a total of 350 days, including 108 days with one of the three reactors off for refueling. Backgrounds were determined by (a) the swap technique based on the difference between signal and background under reversal of the positron and neutron parts of the correlated event, and (b) making use of the conventional reactor-on and reactor-off cycles. There is no evidence for neutrino oscillation and the mode \u03bd e\u2192 \u03bd x was excluded at 90% CL for \u0394 m 2> 1.1\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 at full mixing, and sin 2 2 \u03b8> 0.17 at large \u0394 m 2."
