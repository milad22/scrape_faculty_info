                "A Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, halophilic bacterial strain US6-1T, which degrades high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of two to five rings, was isolated from muddy sediment of Ulsan Bay, Republic of Korea. The 16S rRNA gene of the isolate showed high sequence similarity to Novosphingobium subarcticum (96\u00b723 %) and Sphingopyxis alaskensis (96\u00b718 %); however, the isolate formed a distinct phyletic line within the genus Novosphingobium. DNA\u2013DNA relatedness between US6-1T and the closest strain N. subarcticum revealed that strain US6-1T was independent from this species. Isolate US6-1T had ubiquinone 10 and a DNA G+C ratio of 61\u00b71 mol%. Major fatty acids were octadecanoic acid (18 : 1\u03c97), hexadecanoic acid (16 : 1\u03c97) and 2-hydroxy-myristic acid (14 : 0 2-OH). On the basis of polyphasic taxonomic evidence, strain US6-1T is proposed to represent a novel species in the \u2026",
                "The shift from terrestrial to aquatic life by whales was a substantial evolutionary event. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembly of the minke whale genome, as well as the whole-genome sequences of three minke whales, a fin whale, a bottlenose dolphin and a finless porpoise. Our comparative genomic analysis identified an expansion in the whale lineage of gene families associated with stress-responsive proteins and anaerobic metabolism, whereas gene families related to body hair and sensory receptors were contracted. Our analysis also identified whale-specific mutations in genes encoding antioxidants and enzymes controlling blood pressure and salt concentration. Overall the whale-genome sequences exhibited distinct features that are associated with the physiological and morphological changes needed for life in an aquatic environment, marked by resistance to \u2026",
                "Although a common reaction in anaerobic environments, the conversion of formate and water to bicarbonate and H 2 (with a change in Gibbs free energy of \u0394G=+ 1.3 kJ mol\u2212 1) has not been considered energetic enough to support growth of microorganisms. Recently, experimental evidence for growth on formate was reported for syntrophic communities of Moorella sp. strain AMP and a hydrogen-consuming Methanothermobacter species and of Desulfovibrio sp. strain G11 and Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus strain AZ 1. The basis of the sustainable growth of the formate-users is explained by H 2 consumption by the methanogens, which lowers the H 2 partial pressure, thus making the pathway exergonic 2. However, it has not been shown that a single strain can grow on formate by catalysing its conversion to bicarbonate and H 2. Here we report that several hyperthermophilic archaea belonging to the \u2026",
                "To search for new cold-active lipases, a metagenomic library was constructed using cold-sea sediment samples at Edison Seamount and was screened for lipolytic activities by plating on a tricaprylin medium. Subsequently, a fosmid clone was selected, and the whole sequence of 36 kb insert of the fosmid clone was determined by shotgun sequencing. The sequence analysis revealed the presence of 25 open reading frames (ORF), and ORF20 (EML1) showed similarities to lipases. Phylogenetic analysis of EML1 suggested that the protein belonged to a new family of esterase\/lipase together with LipG. The EML1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by metal-chelating chromatography. The optimum activity of the purified EML1 (rEML1) occurred at pH 8.0 and 25\u00b0C, respectively, and rEML1 displayed more than 50% activity at 5\u00b0C. The activation energy for the hydrolysis of olive oil was \u2026",
                "A treatability study was conducted using sea sand spiked with 3% or 6% (w\/w) of Arabian light crude oil to determine the most effective bioremediation strategies for different levels of contamination. The sea sand used in the study was composed of gravel (0.1%), sand (89.0%), and silt and clay (10.9%). The water content of the sea sand was adjusted to 12.6% (w\/w) for the study. Different combinations of the following treatments were applied to the sand in biometer flasks: the concentration of oil (3% or 6%), the concentration of a mixture of three oil-degrading microorganisms (Corynebacterium sp. IC-10, Sphingomonas sp. KH3-2 and Yarrowia sp. 180, 1 \u00d7 106 or 1 \u00d7 108 cells g\u22121 sand), the concentration of the surfactant Tween 80 (1 or 10 times the critical micelle concentration), and the addition of SRIF in a C:N:P ratio of 100:10:3. Three biometer flasks per combination of experimental conditions were incubated \u2026",
                "A moderately halophilic actinomycete, designated HA-9T, was isolated from a saltern in Kunsan, Republic of Korea, and was the subject of polyphasic identification. Analysis of 16S rDNA indicated that the isolate belonged to the genus Nocardiopsis, but differed genetically from other Nocardiopsis species. Strain HA-9T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, no diagnostic sugars, hexa- or octa-hydrogenated menaquinones with 10 isoprene units, straight-chain saturated or monounsaturated, iso-, anteiso-, 10-methyl branched fatty acids with 13-18 carbons and type III phospholipids. All of these characters consistently assign the isolate to the genus Nocardiopsis. All of the validly described Nocardiopsis species, including moderately halophilic Nocardiopsis halophila, can be differentiated from the saltern isolate using morphological and physiological traits. On the basis of polyphasic evidence, the name Nocardiopsis \u2026",
                "Members of the genus Thermococcus, sulfur-reducing hyperthermophilic archaea, are ubiquitously present in various deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems and are considered to play a significant role in the microbial consortia. We present the complete genome sequence and feature analysis of Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent area, which reveal clues to its physiology. Based on results of genomic analysis, T. onnurineus NA1 possesses the metabolic pathways for organotrophic growth on peptides, amino acids, or sugars. More interesting was the discovery that the genome encoded unique proteins that are involved in carboxydotrophy to generate energy by oxidation of CO to CO2, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for growth with CO as a substrate. This lithotrophic feature in combination with carbon fixation via RuBisCO (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase \u2026",
                "Renewable biomass sources are organic materials, in which solar energy is stored in bio-chemical bonds, and which commonly contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen constituents, along with traces of sulfur. Renewable biomass is now considered as a crucial energy resource, which is able to meet a range of energy requirements, including generating electricity and fueling vehicles. Among all the renewable energy sources, microalgal biomass is unique, since it profitably stores solar energy. It is one of the renewable sources of carbon that can be effectively converted into expedient solid, liquid, and gaseous biofuels through different conversion techniques. In this review, thermochemical conversion technologies involving microalgal biomass are highlighted, with emphasis on the background chemistry and chemical processes. Thermochemical conversion of microalgal biomass via pyrolysis, hydrothermal \u2026",
                " Highly oil-absorbent polyurethane foam (PUF) materials were obtained by polymerizing polyether polyol mixture and carbodiimide-modified d-methyl diisocyanate in a weight ratio of 10:2. The foam materials were prepared to contain inorganic nutrients (slow-release fertilizer; SRF) and oil-degrading yeast cells, Yarrowia lipolytica 180, to be applied for removal of oil films on surface waters through absorption and biodegradation after oil spills. PUFs absorbed 7\u20139\u2009times their own weight of Arabian light crude oil and the oil absorbency appeared to improve as the ratio of surface area to foam weight increased. PUFs showed excellent floatability which was maintained for more than 6 months in sea water, and less than 5% of the absorbed oil was released when the foams were left on water for more than 10 days. For immobilization of yeast cells into PUFs, various immobilization techniques were tested to \u2026",
                "Sixteen sediment samples collected from eight transects in a mangrove swamp of the Jiulong River Estuary, Fujian, China were investigated for their content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the biodegradation potential of the indigenous microorganisms. The bacterial community structures in the mangrove sediments and in enrichment cultures were also investigated. The results showed that the total PAHs concentration of mangrove sediments ranged from 280 to 1074 ng g\u22121 dry weight, that the PAHs composition pattern in the mangrove sediments was dominated by high molecular weight PAH components (4\u20136 rings), and that Benzo[ghi]perylene and Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene were the most dominant at different stations. Abundant PAH-degrading bacteria were found in all the stations, the values of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria ranged from 5.85 \u00d7 104 to 7.80 \u00d7 105 CFU g\u22121 dry weight \u2026"
