Dytman Professor Emeritus 416 Allen Hall (412) 624-9244 dytman@pitt.edu The study of the fundamental properties of neutrinos is one of the frontiers of high energy physics today. Since they are so elusive, experiments come very slowly. However, each one comes packed with information. My interest is in the next generation of high quality measurements which will done at Fermilab and in Japan. To measure neutrino mixing, a good measurement of the \u03bd energy is critical. With the coarse\u2013grained detectors in use today, simulation of detector response is key. I am involved with 2 efforts to improve this determination. The MINER\u03bdA experiment is under construction and started taking data in 2009. I am proud to have a leadership role in this experiment.\u00a0 It will measure basic hadron production cross sections with a fine\u2013grained detector and much better statistics than the past. I will then use these new data to greatly improve the Monte Carlo simulation packages. The second experiment will measure the third neutrino mixing angle \u039813 at the new JPARC accelerator in Japan with much improved accuracy. This experiment will both complete the first generation of experiments and introduce the second generation where CP violation properties will hopefully be measured.\u00a0 This experiment started taking data in 2009.
