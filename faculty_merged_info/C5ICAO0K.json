                "DNA is not just the stuff of our genetic code; it is also a means to design self-assembling materials. Grafting DNA onto nano-and microparticles can, in principle,\u2018program\u2019them with information that tells them exactly how to self-assemble. Although fully programmable assembly has not yet been realized, the groundwork has been laid: with an understanding of how specific interparticle attractions arise from DNA hybridization, we can now make systems that reliably assemble in and out of equilibrium. We discuss these advances, and the design rules that will allow us to control\u2014and ultimately program\u2014the assembly of new materials.",
                "DNA bridging can be used to induce specific attractions between small particles, providing a highly versatile approach to creating unique particle-based materials having a variety of periodic structures. Surprisingly, given the fact that the thermodynamics of DNA strands in solution are completely understood, existing models for DNA-induced particle interactions are typically in error by more than an order of magnitude in strength and a factor of two in their temperature dependence. This discrepancy has stymied efforts to design the complex temperature, sequence and time-dependent interactions needed for the most interesting applications, such as materials having highly complex or multicomponent microstructures or the ability to reconfigure or self-replicate. Here we report high-spatial resolution measurements of DNA-induced interactions between pairs of polystyrene microspheres at binding strengths \u2026",
                "DNA-grafted nanoparticles have been called \u201cprogrammable atom-equivalents\u201d: Like atoms, they form three-dimensional crystals, but unlike atoms, the particles themselves carry information (the sequences of the grafted strands) that can be used to \u201cprogram\u201d the equilibrium crystal structures. We show that the programmability of these colloids can be generalized to the full temperature-dependent phase diagram, not just the crystal structures themselves. We add information to the buffer in the form of soluble DNA strands designed to compete with the grafted strands through strand displacement. Using only two displacement reactions, we program phase behavior not found in atomic systems or other DNA-grafted colloids, including arbitrarily wide gas-solid coexistence, reentrant melting, and even reversible transitions between distinct crystal phases.",
                "Many crystals, such as those of metals, can transform from one symmetry into another having lower free energy via a diffusionless transformation. Here we create binary colloidal crystals consisting of polymer microspheres, pulled together by DNA bridges, that induce specific, reversible attractions between two species of microspheres. Depending on the relative strength of the different interactions, the suspensions spontaneously form either compositionally ordered crystals with CsCl and CuAu-I symmetries, or disordered, solid solution crystals when slowly cooled. Our observations indicate that the CuAu-I crystals form from CsCl parent crystals by a diffusionless transformation, analogous to the Martensitic transformation of iron. Detailed simulations confirm that CuAu-I is not kinetically accessible by direct nucleation from the fluid, but does have a lower free energy than CsCl. The ease with which such structural \u2026",
                "The addition of manganese, iron, and cobalt to NOx storage and reduction (NSR) catalysts containing 1% w\/w platinum and 15% w\/w barium (1Pt\/15Ba) on \u03b3-Al2O3 has been studied. Under fuel lean conditions, the addition of Mn or Fe slightly improved the NOx storage, while the addition of Co more than doubled the NOx storage. In addition, a noble metal free 5Co\/15Ba catalyst was found to store NOx as efficiently as a 1Pt\/15Ba NSR catalyst. This increase in efficiency is associated with the strong oxidizing effect of Co, providing nitric oxide oxidation sites and contact area for NO2 spillover to the Ba NOx storage sites. By utilizing Co as an oxidizing metal instead of Pt, the storage capacity of NSR catalysts can be improved without the need for an expensive noble metal oxidizing catalyst.",
                "The interaction between reaction conditions and catalyst compositions for NOx storage and reduction (NSR) catalysts has been explored using a combination of high-throughput experimentation and experimental design. This was accomplished by varying the concentration of NO and O2, the reducing agent concentration and identity, space velocity, and reactor temperature. All reaction conditions were varied simultaneously for a range of Pt, Ba, and Fe loadings on \u03b3-Al2O3. It was found that most of the reaction conditions investigated affected the saturation NOx storage, the production of nitrous oxide, and the steady state lean NOx reduction. An empirical model was developed using response surface methodology to predict the saturation NOx storage and nitrous oxide production as a function of Pt, Ba, and Fe weight loading. This model was used to optimize the catalytic composition and a comparison between the \u2026",
                "Transient bridges of DNA have been used to direct the self-assembly of colloidal particles into interesting soft materials, but the particle binding kinetics are often slow or anomalous. Using line optical tweezers, we quantify the dynamics of two DNA-coated microspheres as a function of DNA density and strength of the DNA-induced pair interaction potential. At high DNA density, the binding kinetics is limited by the rate of microsphere diffusion and displays the expected dependence on the interaction potential energy. At low DNA density, the particle binding kinetics is set by single molecular binding events and exhibits bound times having a non-exponential distribution, suggesting that individual DNA bridges may also have intrinsic non-exponential kinetics. A dynamic model that includes such dispersion in the lifetimes of molecular bridges reproduces our observations, while an alternative model based on \u2026",
                "We present a new type of hydrogel photonic crystal with a stop band that can be rapidly modulated across the entire visible spectrum. We make these materials by using a high-molecular-weight polymer to induce a depletion attraction between polystyrene-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-bisacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) core-shell particles. The resulting crystals display a stop band at visible wavelengths that can be tuned with temperature at a rate of 60 nm\/s, nearly three orders of magnitude faster than previous photonic-crystal hydrogels. Above a critical concentration of depleting agent, the crystals do not melt even at 40 degrees Celsius. As a result, the stop band can be modulated continuously from red (650 nm) to blue (450 nm), with nearly constant reflectivity throughout the visible spectrum. The unusual thermal stability is due to the polymer used as the depleting agent, which is too large to enter the hydrogel \u2026",
                "The effects of contact-line pinning are well known in macroscopic systems but are only just beginning to be explored at the microscale in colloidal suspensions. We use digital holography to capture the fast three-dimensional dynamics of micrometer-sized ellipsoids breaching an oil-water interface. We find that the particle angle varies approximately linearly with the height, in contrast to results from simulations based on the minimization of the interfacial energy. Using a simple model of the motion of the contact line, we show that the observed coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom is likely due to contact-line pinning. We conclude that the dynamics of colloidal particles adsorbing to a liquid interface are not determined by the minimization of interfacial energy and viscous dissipation alone; contact-line pinning dictates both the time scale and pathway to equilibrium.",
                "Cross-flow membrane emulsification (XME) is a method for producing highly uniform droplets by forcing a fluid through a small orifice into a transverse flow of a second, immiscible fluid. We investigate the feasibility of using XME to produce monodisperse solid microspheres made of a hydrolyzable polymer and a hydrophobic drug, a model system for depot drug delivery applications. This entails the emulsification of a drug and polymer-loaded volatile solvent into water followed by evaporation of the solvent. We use a unique side-view visualization technique to observe the details of emulsion droplet production, providing direct information regarding droplet size, dripping frequency, wetting of the membrane surface by the two phases, neck thinning during droplet break off, and droplet deformation before and after break off. To probe the effects that dissolved polymers, surfactants, and dynamic interfacial tension may \u2026"
