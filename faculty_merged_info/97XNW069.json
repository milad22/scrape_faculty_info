Her group uses ensembles of Nitrogen-vacancy quantum defects in diamond to image magnetic fields with high spatial resolution. We work both to develop state-of-the-art quantum instruments and to use them to study biomagnetism and magnetic properties of novel materials.  Before joining WPI, Raisa was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. She earned her Ph.D. in Optical Sciences from the University of Arizona supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship, and founded the University of Arizona Women in Physics Group. During her graduate studies, Raisa was also a visiting research fellow at the Vienna University of Technology. Raisa completed her BS in Optics and BA in Physics at the University of Rochester. She is a graduate of Mass Academy.

You are here Home Academics Departments & Programs Physics                          Physics                 Physics is the most fundamental of all sciences. At WPI, we encourage the curiosity physicists have about how the world works by giving them the resources and the tools to further the study of the nature and properties of matter and energy. Physicists are problem solvers.\u00a0They are always looking for new ways to approach questions and challenges and develop solutions based on our observations and experimentations.  We want students to follow their passions so a physics degree from WPI is apt to look different for each person. The program is structured so you can take the path that appeals to your natural curiosity. Through project work, students explore everything from developing more protective equipment for athletes to exploring nanoparticles. Students in our specialized master\u2019s in physics education program work in classrooms to improve physics education, teaching methods, and student learning.  WPI\u2019s world-renowned faculty members inspire both undergraduate and graduate students to become engaged in research projects\u2014which often leads to students making important contributions and writing articles for research journals before graduation. Our faculty works collaboratively with students across disciplines, making discoveries in nuclear science, photonics and optics, new materials, biophysics, statistical and solid state physics, spectroscopy, and electromagnetism.
