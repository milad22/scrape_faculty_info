My research involves the measurement of intermolecular forces, as well as the construction of mathematical models and macroscopic devices to mimic atomic-scale behavior. I also have a strong interest in teaching, undergraduate research and outreach. Most of my research has involved substantial undergraduate involvement, in the lab and during the publication process. (Undergraduate co-authors are indicated in bold in the publication list.)
