He collaborates on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which is used to study the highest-energy proton-proton collisions ever generated in a laboratory. These collisions have revealed the existence of the Higgs boson, and continue to be used to study the properties of this particle and to search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). As a faculty at the University of Alabama, besides performing searches for BSM physics, he worked as Deputy Project Manager and Project Manager (2014-2018) of the CMS hadron calorimeter (HCAL), overseeing the data taking and an extensive HCAL Phase-I upgrade program. Since 2018, he has been serving as CMS Deputy Upgrade Coordinator to prepare the entire experiment for a major Phase-II upgrade to meet the challenging data taking conditions of the High-Luminosity LHC, which is scheduled to start operations in 2027. Before joining UA, Dr. Rumerio participated in the commissioning and operations of the CMS electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and then coordinated the activities of the CMS Exotica Leptons+Jets analysis group, where a dozen searches for BSM physics phenomena were performed by many institutions. Before CMS, he collaborated on the experiment E835 at Fermilab National Laboratory, which studied the spectroscopy of charmonium, and the KOPIO experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which proposed to study rare symmetry violating processes in the kaon sector. Dr. Rumerio received his PhD from Northwestern University in 2003. He was a post-doctoral researcher with Northwestern (2003\/04), State University of New York at Stony Brook (2004\/05), a CERN Fellow (2005-2008) and a research associate with the University of Maryland (2008-2011). He joined the faculty of the University of Alabama in 2011."
