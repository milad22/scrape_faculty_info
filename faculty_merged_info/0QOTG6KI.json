I\n                  have studied\u00a0gravitational theories in higher dimensional space-times in an\u00a0effort\n                  to understand how one might combine gravity with particle physics. I have approached\n                  the\u00a0gravity particle physics boundary also via investigations the\u00a0quantum phenomenon\n                  whereby black holes radiate thermal radiation. Recently I have been\u00a0studying the quantum\n                  mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect, where particles\u00a0have their quantum phase modified\n                  even in the case when they experience no classical forces. 1.
