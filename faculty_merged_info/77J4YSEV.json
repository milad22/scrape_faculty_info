                "The direct observation of molecular dynamics initiated by x-rays has been hindered to date by the lack of bright femtosecond sources of short-wavelength light. We used soft x-ray beams generated by high-harmonic upconversion of a femtosecond laser to photoionize a nitrogen molecule, creating highly excited molecular cations. A strong infrared pulse was then used to probe the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics as the molecule exploded. We found that substantial fragmentation occurs through an electron-shakeup process, in which a second electron is simultaneously excited during the soft x-ray photoionization process. During fragmentation, the molecular potential seen by the electron changes rapidly from nearly spherically symmetric to a two-center molecular potential. Our approach can capture in real time and with angstrom resolution the influence of ionizing radiation on a range of molecular systems \u2026",
                "We report significant enhancements in light coupling to intense-laser-created solid plasmas via surface plasmon and \u201clightning rod\u201d effects. We demonstrate this in metal nanoparticle-coated solid targets irradiated with 100 fs, 806 nm laser pulses, focused to intensities\u223c 10 14\u201310 15 W c m\u2212 2. Our experiments show a 13-fold enhancement in hard x-ray yield (10\u2013200 keV) emitted by copper nanoparticle plasmas formed at the focal volume. A simple model explains the observed enhancement quantitatively and provides pointers to the design of structured surfaces for maximizing such emissions."

My research is geared towards the new applications of attosecond spectroscopy to address\u00a0questions in the areas of Atomic and Molecular Physics, Chemical Physics and Nanomaterials.\u00a0Research projects in my lab focus on the 1)\u00a0Generation and application of high-flux attosecond\u00a0x-ray\u00a0pulses, 2) Study of charge migration and coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in\u00a0molecules, 3) Electronic\u00a0wavepacket dynamics and decoherence, 4) Control of electronic\u00a0processes with\u00a0laser fields, 5) Exciton dynamics and electron correlations in\u00a0two-dimensional materials.\u00a0Recently, we demonstrated the use of extreme ultraviolet, attosecond light bursts to strobe the motion of an\u00a0electron in a polyatomic molecule and film its coherent evolution near a conical intersection. At this\u00a0intersection, the simple energy landscape picture breaks down and the electron is essentially at molecular\u00a0crossroads. Our results shed light on the question of how strongly electrons and nuclei influence each other\u00a0during charge transfer.
