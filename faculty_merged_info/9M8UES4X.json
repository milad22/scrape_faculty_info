                "We squeeze unconditionally the collective spin of a dilute ensemble of laser-cooled Rb 87 atoms using their interaction with a driven optical resonator. The shape and size of the resulting spin uncertainty region are well described by a simple analytical model [MH Schleier-Smith, ID Leroux, and V. Vuleti\u0107, arXiv: 0911.3936 [Phys. Rev. A (to be published)]] through 2 orders of magnitude in the effective interaction strength, without free parameters. We deterministically generate states with up to 5.6 (6) dB of metrologically relevant spin squeezing on the canonical Rb 87 hyperfine clock transition.",
                "We generate entangled states of an ensemble of 5\u00d7 10 4 Rb 87 atoms by optical quantum nondemolition measurement. The resonator-enhanced measurement leaves the atomic ensemble, prepared in a superposition of hyperfine clock levels, in a squeezed spin state. By comparing the resulting reduction of quantum projection noise [up to 8.8 (8) dB] with the concomitant reduction of coherence, we demonstrate a clock input state with spectroscopic sensitivity 3.0 (8) dB beyond the standard quantum limit.",
                "We provide a general protocol to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions. These correlation functions are of broad theoretical interest for diagnosing the scrambling of quantum information in interacting quantum systems and have recently received particular attention in the study of chaos and black holes within holographic duality. Measuring them requires an echo-type sequence in which the sign of a many-body Hamiltonian is reversed. We illustrate our protocol by detailing an implementation employing cold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics to probe spin models with nonlocal interactions. To verify the feasibility of the scheme with current technology, we analyze the effects of dissipation in a chaotic kicked-top model. Finally, we propose a number of other experimental platforms where similar out-of-time-order correlation functions can be measured.",
                "The geometric structure of a single-particle energy band in a solid is fundamental for a wide range of many-body phenomena and is uniquely characterized by the distribution of Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. We realize an atomic interferometer to measure Berry flux in momentum space, in analogy to an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer that measures magnetic flux in real space. We demonstrate the interferometer for a graphene-type hexagonal optical lattice loaded with bosonic atoms. By detecting the singular \u03c0 Berry flux localized at each Dirac point, we establish the high momentum resolution of this interferometric technique. Our work forms the basis for a general framework to fully characterize topological band structures.",
                "We study experimentally the application of a class of entangled states, squeezed spin states, to the improvement of atomic-clock precision. In the presence of anisotropic noise, the entanglement lifetime is strongly dependent on squeezing orientation. We measure the Allan deviation spectrum of a clock operated with a phase-squeezed input state. For averaging times up to 50 s the squeezed clock achieves a given precision 2.8 (3) times faster than a clock operating at the standard quantum limit.",
                "We propose and analyze a simple method to squeeze dynamically and unconditionally the collective spin of a dilute atomic ensemble by interaction with a driven mode of an optical resonator, as recently demonstrated [ID Leroux, MH Schleier-Smith, and V. Vuleti\u0107, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 073602 (2010)]. We show that substantial squeezing can be achieved in the regime of strong collective ensemble-resonator coupling. The squeezing is ultimately limited either by photon emission into free space or by the curvature of the Bloch sphere. We derive both limits and show where each prevails.",
                "Topology and geometry are essential to our understanding of modern physics, underlying many foundational concepts from high-energy theories, quantum information, and condensed-matter physics. In condensed-matter systems, a wide range of phenomena stem from the geometry of the band eigenstates, which is encoded in the matrix-valued Wilson line for general multiband systems. Using an ultracold gas of rubidium atoms loaded in a honeycomb optical lattice, we realize strong-force dynamics in Bloch bands that are described by Wilson lines and observe an evolution in the band populations that directly reveals the band geometry. Our technique enables a full determination of band eigenstates, Berry curvature, and topological invariants, including single- and multiband Chern and  numbers.",
                "Many effects in the interaction between atoms and a cavity that are usually described in quantum mechanical terms (cavity quantum electrodynamics, cavity QED) can be understood and quantitatively analyzed within a classical framework. We adopt such a classical picture of a radiating dipole oscillator to derive explicit expressions for the coupling of single atoms and atomic ensembles to Gaussian modes in free space and in an optical resonator. The cooperativity parameter of cavity QED is shown to play a central role and is given a geometrical interpretation. The classical analysis yields transparent, intuitive results that are useful for analyzing applications of cavity QED such as atom detection and counting, cavity cooling, cavity spin squeezing, cavity spin optomechanics, or phase transitions associated with the self-organization of the ensemble-light system.",
                "We demonstrate cavity sideband cooling of a single collective motional mode of an atomic ensemble down to a mean phonon occupation number\u27e8 n\u27e9 min\ufeff= 2.0\u2212 0.3+ 0.9. Both\u27e8 n\u27e9 min\ufeff and the observed cooling rate are in good agreement with an optomechanical model. The cooling rate constant is proportional to the total photon scattering rate by the ensemble, demonstrating the cooperative character of the light-emission-induced cooling process. We deduce fundamental limits to cavity cooling either the collective mode or, sympathetically, the single-atom degrees of freedom.",
                "We propose an approach to quantum phase estimation that can attain precision near the Heisenberg limit without requiring single-particle-resolved state detection. We show that the \u201cone-axis twisting\u201d interaction, well known for generating spin squeezing in atomic ensembles, can also amplify the output signal of an entanglement-enhanced interferometer to facilitate readout. Applying this interaction-based readout to oversqueezed, non-Gaussian states yields a Heisenberg scaling in phase sensitivity, which persists in the presence of detection noise as large as the quantum projection noise of an unentangled ensemble. Even in dissipative implementations\u2014eg, employing light-mediated interactions in an optical cavity or Rydberg dressing\u2014the method significantly relaxes the detection resolution required for spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit."

C., Schleier-Smith, M., Vishwanath, A., Yao, N. Y. 119 (12) : 123601 We propose and analyze two distinct routes toward realizing interacting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases via periodic driving. First, we demonstrate that a driven transverse-field Ising model can be used to engineer complex interactions which enable the emulation of an equilibrium SPT phase. This phase remains stable only within a parametric time scale controlled by the driving frequency, beyond which its topological features break down. To overcome this issue, we consider an alternate route based upon realizing an intrinsically Floquet SPT phase that does not have any equilibrium analog. In both cases, we show that disorder, leading to many-body localization, prevents runaway heating and enables the observation of coherent quantum dynamics at high energy densities. Furthermore, we clarify the distinction between the equilibrium and Floquet SPT phases by identifying a unique micromotion-based entanglement spectrum signature of the latter. Finally, we propose a unifying implementation in a one-dimensional chain of Rydberg-dressed atoms and show that protected edge modes are observable on realistic experimental time scales.

L., Kupper, J., Friedrich, B., Schleier-Smith, M., Haak, H., Meijer, G. 111 (31) : 7411-7419 A linear AC trap for polar molecules in high-field seeking states has been devised and implemented, and its characteristics have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The trap is loaded with slow 15ND3 molecules in their ground state (para-ammonia) from a Stark decelerator. The trap's geometry offers optimal access as well as improved loading. We present measurements of the dependence of the trap's performance on the switching frequency, which exhibit a characteristic structure due to nonlinear resonance effects. The molecules are found to oscillate in the trap under the influence of the trapping forces, which were analyzed using 3D numerical simulations. On the basis of expansion measurements, molecules with a velocity and a position spread of 2.1 m\/s and 0.4 mm, respectively, are still accepted by the trap. This corresponds to a temperature of 2.0 mK. From numerical simulations, we find the phase-space volume that can be confined by the trap (the acceptance) to be 50 mm3 (m\/s)3.

H., Schleier-Smith, M. H., Ellenbogen, J. C. 92 (8) We investigate the interaction of a carbon nanotube with a graphite substrate, using an interlayer potential that explicitly treats the registry dependence of the interaction. The carbon-carbon bond lengths in nanotubes differ slightly from those in flat graphite, so that the naively commensurate angular orientations for the tube with respect to the substrate lattice are destroyed. The interaction of a one-dimensional tube with a two-dimensional substrate then leads to an unusual registry phenomenon not visible in standard layer-on-layer growth: the system develops favorable orientations which clearly are incommensurate.

A ttosecond to femtosecond processes, quantum properties of atoms and photons, testing fundamental physics. Research in atomic, molecular, laser and X-ray physics at Stanford takes place in the Physics and Applied Physics Departments and in the Photon Science Department at National Accelerator Laboratory. A rich set of topics are explored in the Varian Physics Laboratory, the Ginzton Lab and through the PULSE Institute for Ultrafast Energy Science. SLAC houses both the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource and the Linac Coherent Light Source The structure and dynamics of matter at the atomic scale -- from Angstroms to nanometers in space and attoseconds to femtoseconds in time -- are studied using strong laser and x-ray fields to control and probe the quantum evolution of atoms and molecules. Basic questions in atomic physics are addressed through measurements of \"simple\" atoms, often laser-cooled and at the quantum-measurement level, leading to applications in real-world systems. Precision control of lasers and atoms are used for tests of space-time, advanced optical clocks, ultra-fast timing, atomic sensors, and ultra-sensitive detection of trace atoms.\u00a0 Quantum sensors of rotation and acceleration based on cold atoms (quantum metrology) are being developed for tests of general relativity, the investigation of many-body quantum effects in Bose-condensed vapors, and ultra-fast laser-induced phenomena. Other efforts aim to create and study novel quantum many-body systems, including quantum soft matter, using new techniques developed for creating and manipulating exotic dipolar ultracold atoms in optical lattices, near cryogenic surfaces, and inside multimode optical resonators.\u00a0 This research aims to elucidate the interplay between superfluidity, crystallinity, and magnetism to provide better intuition about the organizing principles of strongly interacting matter. Future efforts at Stanford will focus on the generation and detection of highly entangled many-body states of ultracold atoms, primarily using techniques of cavity QED, the exploration of quantum critical phenomena and routes to topological encoding of quantum information.
