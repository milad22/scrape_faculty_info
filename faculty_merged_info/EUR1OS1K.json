                "The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available 1. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor \u2026",
                "The RENO experiment has observed the disappearance of reactor electron antineutrinos, consistent with neutrino oscillations, with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations. Antineutrinos from six 2.8 GW th reactors at the Yonggwang Nuclear Power Plant in Korea, are detected by two identical detectors located at 294 and 1383 m, respectively, from the reactor array center. In the 229 d data-taking period between 11 August 2011 and 26 March 2012, the far (near) detector observed 17102 (154088) electron antineutrino candidate events with a background fraction of 5.5%(2.7%). The ratio of observed to expected numbers of antineutrinos in the far detector is 0.920\u00b10.009 (stat)\u00b10.014 (syst). From this deficit, we determine sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.113\u00b10.013 (stat)\u00b10.019 (syst) based on a rate-only analysis.",
                "Polymers that display a physicochemical response to stimuli are widely explored as potential drug-delivery systems 1, 2, 3, 4. Stimuli studied to date include chemical substances and changes in temperature, pH and electric field. Homopolymers or copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide 5, 6 and poly (ethylene oxide)\u2013poly (propylene oxide)\u2013poly (ethylene oxide)(known as poloxamers) 7 are typical examples of thermosensitive polymers, but their use in drug delivery is problematic because they are toxic and non-biodegradable. Biodegradable polymers used for drug delivery to date have mostly been in the form of injectable microspheres or implant systems, which require complicated fabrication processes using organic solvents 8. Such systems have the disadvantage that the use of organic solvents can cause denaturation when protein drugs are to be encapsulated. Furthermore, the solid form requires surgical \u2026",
                "S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitrogen monoxide group to the thiol side chain of cysteine, has emerged as an important mechanism for dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all main classes of protein. S-nitrosylation thereby conveys a large part of the ubiquitous influence of nitric oxide (NO) on cellular signal transduction, and provides a mechanism for redox-based physiological regulation.",
                "Aqueous polymer solutions that are transformed into gels by changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature and pH, thus resulting in in situ hydrogel formation, have recently attracted the attention of many investigators for scientific interest and for practical biomedical or pharmaceutical applications. When the hydrogel is formed under physiological conditions and maintains its integrity for a desired period of time, the process may provide various advantages over conventional hydrogels. Because of the simplicity of pharmaceutical formulation by solution mixing, biocompatibility with biological systems, and convenient administration, the pharmaceutical and biomedical uses of the water-based sol\u2013gel transition include solubilization of low-molecular-weight hydrophobic drugs, controlled release, labile biomacromolecule delivery, such as proteins and genes, cell immobilization, and tissue engineering \u2026",
                "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on aqueous solutions of polyCZV-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methacrylate-co-X), with X being hydrophilic, hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic comonomers, to elucidate the mechanism of temperature-induced phase separation and the effect of comonomer content, hydrophilicity, and charge on the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The endothermic heat of phase separation, which is related to the breaking of hydrogen bonds between water molecules surrounding hydrophobic moieties on the polymer, was a linear, decreasing function of the LCST. This suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between polymer side groups, which are the major driving force for phase separation, are enhanced at elevated temperatures due to a decrease in the structuring of water around hydrophobic side groups. It is concluded that the changes in LCST caused by the \u2026",
                "Gene therapy provides great opportunities for treating diseases from genetic disorders, infections and cancer. To achieve successful gene therapy, development of proper gene delivery systems could be one of the most important factors. Several non-viral gene transfer methods have been developed to overcome the safety problems of their viral counterpart. Polymer-based non-viral gene carriers have been used due to their merits in safety including the avoidance of potential immunogenecity and toxicity, the possibility of repeated administration, and the ease of the establishment of good manufacturing practice (GMP). A wide range of polymeric vectors have been utilized to deliver therapeutic genes in vivo. The modification of polymeric vectors has also shown successful improvements in achieving target-specific delivery and in promoting intracellular gene transfer efficiency. Various systemic and cellular barriers \u2026",
                "The widespread use of thermoelectric technology is constrained by a relatively low conversion efficiency of the bulk alloys, which is evaluated in terms of a dimensionless figure of merit (zT). The zT of bulk alloys can be improved by reducing lattice thermal conductivity through grain boundary and point-defect scattering, which target low- and high-frequency phonons. Dense dislocation arrays formed at low-energy grain boundaries by liquid-phase compaction in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (bismuth antimony telluride) effectively scatter midfrequency phonons, leading to a substantially lower lattice thermal conductivity. Full-spectrum phonon scattering with minimal charge-carrier scattering dramatically improved the zT to 1.86 \u00b1 0.15 at 320 kelvin (K). Further, a thermoelectric cooler confirmed the performance with a maximum temperature difference of 81 K, which is much higher than current commercial Peltier cooling devices.",
                "Enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient (S) without reducing the electrical conductivity (\u03c3) is essential to realize practical thermoelectric materials exhibiting a dimensionless figure of merit (Z T= S 2\u00b7 \u03c3\u00b7 T\u00b7 \u03ba\u2212 1) exceeding 2, where T is the absolute temperature and \u03ba is the thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that a high-density two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined within a unit cell layer thickness in SrTiO 3 yields unusually large| S|, approximately five times larger than that of SrTiO 3 bulks, while maintaining a high \u03c3 2DEG. In the best case, we observe| S|= 850 \u03bcV K\u2212 1 and \u03c3 2DEG= 1.4\u00d7 10 3 S cm\u2212 1. In addition, by using the \u03ba of bulk single-crystal SrTiO 3 at room temperature, we estimate ZT\u223c 2.4 for the 2DEG, corresponding to ZT\u223c 0.24 for a complete device having the 2DEG as the active region. The present approach using a 2DEG provides a new route to realize practical thermoelectric \u2026",
                "Purpose: Although microRNAs have recently been recognized as riboregulators of gene expression, little is known about microRNA expression profiles in serous ovarian carcinoma. We assessed the expression of microRNA and the association between microRNA expression and the prognosis of serous ovarian carcinoma.Experimental Design: Twenty patients diagnosed with serous ovarian carcinoma and eight patients treated for benign uterine disease between December 2000 and September 2003 were enrolled in this study. The microRNA expression profiles were examined using DNA microarray and Northern blot analyses.Results: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients.

                "Philip Kim Philip Kim Professor of Physics and of Applied Physics Philip Kim is an experimental condensed matter physicist. The focus of Kim group\u2019s research is the mesoscopic investigation of various physical phenomena in low dimensional and nanostructured materials. In a nanoscaled material, effectively reduced dimensionality of the electron system yields enhanced quantum effects and increased correlation effects due to the reduction of available phase space. The low dimensional materials the Kim group is working on include 2-dimensional mesoscopic crystals, 1-dimensional nanowires and nanotubes, and single organic and inorganic molecular crystals. The use of modern state-of-the-art device fabrication techniques and the development of novel material synthesis\/manipulation methods are essential parts of our research. The current research topics are: quantum transport in graphene and its heterostructures; developing heterostructured van der Waals material interfaces; mesoscale investigation physics of correlated materials; and quantum engineered thermoelectric\/ thermal transport. ____________________________________ kim_grp@fas.harvard.edu LISE 410 11 Oxford Street pkim@physics.harvard.edu p: (617) 496-0714"
