                "Jackson Pollock\u2019s paintings are currently valued up to US$75 M, triggering discussions that attributation procedures featuring subjective visual assessments should be complimented by quantitative scientific procedures. We present a fractal analysis of Pollock\u2019s patterns and discuss its potential for authenticity research.",
                "We use magnetoconductance fluctuation measurements of phase-coherent semiconductor billiards to quantify the contributions to the nonlinear electric conductance that are asymmetric under reversal of magnetic field. We find that the average asymmetric contribution is linear in magnetic field (for magnetic flux much larger than 1 flux quantum) and that its magnitude depends on billiard geometry. In addition, we find an unexpected asymmetry in the power spectrum of the magnetoconductance with respect to reversal of magnetic field and bias voltage.",
                "The well-established symmetry relations for linear transport phenomena cannot, in general, be applied in the nonlinear regime. Here we propose a set of symmetry relations with respect to bias voltage and magnetic field for the nonlinear conductance of two-terminal electric conductors. We experimentally confirm these relations using phase-coherent, semiconductor quantum dots.",
                "We present an experimental comparison of magnetoconductance fluctuations measured in the ballistic, quasiballistic, and diffusive scattering regimes of semiconductor devices. In contradiction to expectations, we show that the spectral content of the magnetoconductance fluctuations exhibits an identical fractal behavior for these scattering regimes and that this behavior is remarkably insensitive to device boundary properties. We propose a unified model of fractal conductance fluctuations in the ballistic, quasiballistic, and diffusive transport regimes, in which the generic fractal behavior is generated by a subtle interplay between boundary and material-induced chaotic scattering events.",
                "The strength of the Zeeman splitting induced by an applied magnetic field is an important factor for the realization of spin-resolved transport in mesoscopic devices. We measure the Zeeman splitting for a quantum point contact etched into a Ga0.25In0.75As quantum well, with the field oriented parallel to the transport direction. We observe an enhancement of the Land\u00e9 g-factor from |g\u2217|=3.8\u00b10.2 for the third subband to |g\u2217|=5.8\u00b10.6 for the first subband, six times larger than in GaAs. We report subband spacings in excess of 10 meV, which facilitates quantum transport at higher temperatures.",
                "We study the Zeeman spin splitting in a quantum point contact (QPC) etched into an InGaAs\/InP heterostructure for three orthogonal magnetic field orientations with respect to the QPC. For the two in-plane orientations we observe an isotropic Zeeman spin splitting, which becomes stronger as the system is made more one dimensional. The Lande g factor is enhanced by up to a factor of two compared to two-dimensional electron systems in InGaAs\/InP. A much larger Zeeman splitting is observed when the field is oriented perpendicular to the heterostructure, resulting in a g factor of 15.7 in the one-dimensional limit.",
                "We study the electrostatic confinement properties of a ballistic GaInAs nanostructure, a system with a high potential for quantum applications due to its small effective mass and persistence of quantum effects to higher temperatures. By measuring the magnetic depopulation of one-dimensional subbands in an etched quantum point contact, we demonstrate that the slope of the confinement at the Fermi level is an order of magnitude steeper than in surface-gated devices, indicating that this system is ideal for applications that are sensitive to the boundary geometry of devices. The subband spacing is found to range from 7 to 9.5 meV, which is significantly larger than previously reported for this material system.",
                "Semiconductor billiards are often considered as ideal systems for studying dynamical chaos in the quantum mechanical limit. In the traditional picture, once the electron's mean free path, as determined by the mobility, becomes larger than the device, disorder is negligible and electron trajectories are shaped by specular reflection from the billiard walls alone. Experimental insight into the electron dynamics is normally obtained by magnetoconductance measurements. A number of recent experimental studies have shown these measurements to be largely independent of the billiard's exact shape, and highly dependent on sample\u2010to\u2010sample variations in disorder. In this paper, we discuss these more recent findings within the full historical context of work on semiconductor billiards, and offer strong evidence that small\u2010angle scattering at the sub\u2010100 nm length\u2010scale dominates transport in these devices. This has \u2026",
                "We investigate the dynamic structure of human gaze and present an experimental study of the frequency components of the change in gaze position over time during free viewing of computer-generated fractal images. We show that changes in gaze position are scale-invariant in time with statistical properties that are characteristic of a random walk process. We quantify and track changes in the temporal structure using a well-defined scaling parameter called the Hurst exponent, H. We find H is robust regardless of the spatial complexity generated by the fractal images. In addition, we find the Hurst exponent is invariant across all participants, including those with distinct changes to higher order visual processes due to neural degeneration. The value we find for H of 0.57 shows that the gaze dynamics during free viewing of fractal images are consistent with a random walk process with persistent movements. Our research suggests the human visual system may have a common strategy that drives the dynamics of human gaze during exploration.",
                "The ability to scale device sizes to below a micro-meter has profound implications for electron conduction in semiconductor systems. For conventional circuits, the reduced component size offers the rewards of higher packing densities and faster operating speeds. However, in terms of the search for new classes of electronic devices, designed to replace the transistor as the basic component of electronic circuits, the prospect of current flow across sub-micron distances holds even greater potential. Traditional current flow concepts, in which electron propagation along the device\u2019s length is modeled as a classical diffusion process, can no longer be applied. Both the classical and quantum mechanical transmission characteristics may ultimately be harnessed to produce revolutionary modes of device functionality. Intimately coupled to these objectives of applied physics, sub-micron devices also provide a novel \u2026"
