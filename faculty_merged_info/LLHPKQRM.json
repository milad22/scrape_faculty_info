                "We explore the analytic structure of the gluon and quark propagators of Landau gauge QCD from numerical solutions of the coupled system of renormalized Dyson-Schwinger equations and from fits to lattice data. We find sizable negative norm contributions in the transverse gluon propagator indicating the absence of the transverse gluon from the physical spectrum. A simple analytic structure for the gluon propagator is proposed. For the quark propagator we find evidence for a masslike singularity on the real timelike momentum axis, with a mass of 350 to 500 MeV. Within the Green\u2019s function approach that is employed, we identify a crucial term in the quark-gluon vertex that leads to a positive definite Schwinger function for the quark propagator.",
                "We present evidence for the existence of a bound H dibaryon, an I= 0, J= 0, s=\u2212 2 state with valence quark structure u u d d s s, at a pion mass of m \u03c0\u223c 389 MeV. Using the results of lattice QCD calculations performed on four ensembles of anisotropic clover gauge-field configurations, with spatial extents of L\u223c 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.9 fm at a spatial lattice spacing of b s\u223c 0.123 fm, we find an H dibaryon bound by B\u221e H= 16.6\u00b12.1\u00b14.6 MeV at a pion mass of m \u03c0\u223c 389 MeV.",
                "The binding energies of a range of nuclei and hypernuclei with atomic number A\u2264 4 and strangeness| s|\u2264 2, including the deuteron, dineutron, H-dibaryon, He 3, He \u039b 3, He 4, He \u039b 4, and He \u039b \u039b 4, are calculated in the limit of flavor-SU (3) symmetry at the physical strange-quark mass with quantum chromodynamics (without electromagnetic interactions). The nuclear states are extracted from lattice QCD calculations performed with n f= 3 dynamical light quarks using an isotropic clover discretization of the quark action in three lattice volumes of spatial extent L\u223c 3.4 fm, 4.5 fm, and 6.7 fm, and with a single lattice spacing b\u223c 0.145 fm.",
                "We present the resolution of a long-standing discrepancy between the moments of parton distributions calculated from lattice QCD and their experimental values. We propose a simple extrapolation formula for the moments of the nonsinglet quark distribution u\u2212 d, as a function of quark mass, which embodies the general constraints imposed by the chiral symmetry of QCD. The inclusion of the leading nonanalytic behavior leads to an excellent description of both the lattice data and the experimental values of the moments."

Detmold uses analytic methods and supercomputers to solve the complex equations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that describe the strong interaction and seeks to understand the emergence of hadrons and nuclei from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics. He aims to determine the properties and interactions of these systems from first principles to confront experiment and to make predictions for regimes such as in the interior of neutron stars where experiments are not possible. Professor Detmold obtained his PhD from the University of Adelaide, Australia and joined the MIT physics faculty in 2012, moving from the College of William & Mary where he was an Assistant Professor. Prior to that position, he was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Washington. Professor Detmold is the recipient of a Department of Energy Outstanding Junior Investigator award.
