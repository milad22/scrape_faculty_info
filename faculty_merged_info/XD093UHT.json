                "Optical trapping of dielectric particles by a single-beam gradient force trap was demonstrated for the first reported time. This confirms the concept of negative light pressure due to the gradient force. Trapping was observed over the entire range of particle size from 10 \u03bcm to ~25 nm in water. Use of the new trap extends the size range of macroscopic particles accessible to optical trapping and manipulation well into the Rayleigh size regime. Application of this trapping principle to atom trapping is considered.",
                "Access to clean, affordable and reliable energy has been a cornerstone of the world's increasing prosperity and economic growth since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Our use of energy in the twenty\u2013first century must also be sustainable. Solar and water\u2013based energy generation, and engineering of microbes to produce biofuels are a few examples of the alternatives. This Perspective puts these opportunities into a larger context by relating them to a number of aspects in the transportation and electricity generation sectors. It also provides a snapshot of the current energy landscape and discusses several research and development opportunities and pathways that could lead to a prosperous, sustainable and secure energy future for the world.",
                "With about two-thirds of all used energy being lost as waste heat, there is a compelling need for high-performance thermoelectric materials that can directly and reversibly convert heat to electrical energy. However, the practical realization of thermoelectric materials is limited by their hitherto low figure of merit, ZT, which governs the Carnot efficiency according to the second law of thermodynamics. The recent successful strategy of nanostructuring to reduce thermal conductivity has achieved record-high ZT values in the range 1.5\u20131.8 at 750\u2013900 kelvin 1, 2, 3, but still falls short of the generally desired threshold value of 2. Nanostructures in bulk thermoelectrics allow effective phonon scattering of a significant portion of the phonon spectrum, but phonons with long mean free paths remain largely unaffected. Here we show that heat-carrying phonons with long mean free paths can be scattered by controlling and fine \u2026"

Nano letters Lee, H. R., Liao, L., Xiao, W., Vailionis, A., Ricco, A. J., White, R., Nishi, Y., Chiu, W., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 The global COVID-19 pandemic has changed many aspects of daily lives. Wearing personal protective equipment, especially respirators (face masks), has become common for both the public and medical professionals, proving to be effective in preventing spread of the virus. Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of respirator filtration-layer internal structures and their physical configurations is lacking. Here, we report three-dimensional (3D) internal analysis of N95 filtration layers via X-ray tomography. Using deep learning methods, we uncover how the distribution and diameters of fibers within these layers directly affect contaminant particle filtration. The average porosity of the filter layers is found to be 89.1%. Contaminants are more efficiently captured by denser fiber regions, with fibers <1.8 mum in diameter being particularly effective, presumably because of the stronger electric field gradient on smaller diameter fibers. This study provides critical information for further development of N95-type respirators that combine high efficiency with good breathability.

Nano letters Zhao, M., Liao, L., Xiao, W., Yu, X., Wang, H., Wang, Q., Lin, Y. L., Kilinc-Balci, F. S., Price, A., Chu, L., Chu, M. C., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic is currently causing a severe disruption and shortage in the global supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment (e.g., N95 respirators). The U.S. CDC has recommended use of household cloth by the general public to make cloth face coverings as a method of source control. We evaluated the filtration properties of natural and synthetic materials using a modified procedure for N95 respirator approval. Common fabrics of cotton, polyester, nylon, and silk had filtration efficiency of 5-25%, polypropylene spunbond had filtration efficiency 6-10%, and paper-based products had filtration efficiency of 10-20%. An advantage of polypropylene spunbond is that it can be simply triboelectrically charged to enhance the filtration efficiency (from 6 to >10%) without any increase in pressure (stable overnight and in humid environments). Using the filtration quality factor, fabric microstructure, and charging ability, we are able to provide an assessment of suggested fabric materials for homemade facial coverings. DOI 10.1021\/acs.nanolett.0c02211 PubMedID 32484683 Can N95 Respirators Be Reused after Disinfection? How Many Times? ACS nano Liao, L., Xiao, W., Zhao, M., Yu, X., Wang, H., Wang, Q., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential for protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus. Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protective equipment in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Heating was recently found to inactivate the virus in solution within 5 min at 70 \u00b0C and is among the most scalable, user-friendly methods for viral disinfection. We found that heat (\u226485 \u00b0C) under various humidities (\u2264100% relative humidity, RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. At 85 \u00b0C, 30% RH, we were able to perform 50 cycles of heat treatment without significant changes in the filtration efficiency. At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 \u00b0C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.

Here we demonstrate a difference-frequency ultrasound (dfUS) imaging method that is based on the interaction of two sound pulses that propagate non-collinearly and intersect in space and time. The dfUS signal arises primarily from the second-order non-linear coefficient, a contrast mechanism that differs from linear and harmonic US imaging. The distinct contrast mechanism allows dfUS to image anatomic features that are not identifiable in conventional US images of salmon and pig kidney tissue. Further, dfUS produces enhanced contrast of glioblastoma tumor implanted in the mouse brain, revealing its potential for improving medical diagnosis. Progress towards a real-time system is discussed.

I., Chu, S., Jin, D. 2020 579 (7797) : 41\u201350 Tremendous progress in nanotechnology has enabled advances in the use of luminescent nanomaterials in imaging, sensing and photonic devices. This translational process relies on controlling the photophysical properties of the building block, that is, single luminescent nanoparticles. In this Review, we highlight the importance of single-particle spectroscopy in revealing the diverse optical properties and functionalities of nanomaterials, and compare it with ensemble fluorescence spectroscopy. The information provided by this technique has guided materials science in tailoring the synthesis of nanomaterials to achieve optical uniformity and to develop novel applications. We discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise from pushing the resolution limit, integrating measurement and manipulation modalities, and establishing the relationship between the structure and functionality of single nanoparticles.

Nature nanotechnology Wang, H., Tzeng, Y., Ji, Y., Li, Y., Li, J., Zheng, X., Yang, A., Liu, Y., Gong, Y., Cai, L., Li, Y., Zhang, X., Chen, W., Liu, B., Lu, H., Melosh, N. A., Shen, Z., Chan, K., Tan, T., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 To date, effective control over the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multicarbon products (C\u22652) has been very challenging. Here, we report a design principle for the creation of a selective yet robust catalytic interface for heterogeneous electrocatalysts in the reduction of CO2 to C2 oxygenates, demonstrated by rational tuning of an assembly of nitrogen-doped nanodiamonds and copper nanoparticles. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of ~63% towards C2 oxygenates at applied potentials of only -0.5V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, this catalyst shows an unprecedented persistent catalytic performance up to 120h, with steady current and only 19% activity decay. Density functional theory calculations show that CO binding is strengthened at the copper\/nanodiamond interface, suppressing CO desorption and promoting C2 production by lowering the apparent barrier for CO dimerization. The inherent compositional and electronic tunability of the catalyst assembly offers an unrivalled degree of control over the catalytic interface, and thereby the reaction energetics and kinetics.

Nature nanotechnology Yang, A., Zhou, G., Kong, X., Vil\u00e1, R. A., Pei, A., Wu, Y., Yu, X., Zheng, X., Wu, C. L., Liu, B., Chen, H., Xu, Y., Chen, D., Li, Y., Fakra, S., Hwang, H. Y., Qin, J., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 It has recently been shown that sulfur, a solid material in its elementary form S8, can stay in a supercooled state as liquid sulfur in an electrochemical cell. We establish that this newly discovered state could have implications for lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, through in situ studies of electrochemical sulfur generation, we show that liquid (supercooled) and solid elementary sulfur possess very different areal capacities over the same charging period. To control the physical state of sulfur, we studied its growth on two-dimensional layered materials. We found that on the basal plane, only liquid sulfur accumulates; by contrast, at the edge sites, liquid sulfur accumulates if the thickness of the two-dimensional material is small, whereas solid sulfur nucleates if the thickness is large (tens of nanometres). Correlating the sulfur states with their respective areal capacities, as well as controlling the growth of sulfur on two-dimensional materials, could provide insights for the design of future lithium-sulfur batteries.

Structure (London, England : 1993) Park, S. R., Hauver, J., Zhang, Y., Revyakin, A., Coleman, R. A., Tjian, R., Chu, S., Pertsinidis, A. 2020 Single-molecule detection and manipulation is a powerful tool for unraveling dynamic biological processes. Unfortunately, success in such experiments is often challenged by tethering the biomolecule(s) of interest to a biocompatible surface. Here, we describe a robust surface passivation method by dense polymer brush grafting, based on optimized polyethylene glycol (PEG) deposition conditions, exactly at the lower critical point of an aqueous biphasic PEG-salt system. The increased biocompatibility achieved, compared with PEG deposition in sub-optimal conditions away from the critical point, allowed us to successfully detect the assembly and function of a large macromolecular machine, a fluorescent-labeled multi-subunit, human RNA Polymerase II Transcription Pre-Initiation Complex, on single, promoter-containing, surface-immobilized DNA molecules. This platform will enable probing the complex biochemistry and dynamics of large, multi-subunit macromolecular assemblies, such as during the initiation of human RNA Pol II transcription, at the single-molecule level.

PloS one Anderegg, L., Meisenhelder, C., Ngooi, C. O., Liao, L., Xiao, W., Chu, S., Cui, Y., Doyle, J. M. 2020 15 (7) : e0234851 A lack of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk. It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85\u00b0C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, all three respirators pass both quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.

ACS nano Campos, R. K., Jin, J., Rafael, G. H., Zhao, M., Liao, L., Simmons, G., Chu, S., Weaver, S. C., Chiu, W., Cui, Y. 2020 In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic led to a shortage of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), especially surgical-grade N95 FFRs for protection of healthcare professionals against airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95 \u00b0C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75 \u00b0C for 30 min or 85 \u00b0C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and another enveloped RNA virus, chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181\/25 (CHIKV-181\/25), without lowering the meltblown fabric's filtration efficiency.

L., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 11 (1) : 606 Manipulating liquids with tunable shape and optical functionalities in real time is important for electroactive flow devices and optoelectronic devices, but remains a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate electrotunable liquid sulfur\u00a0microdroplets in an electrochemical cell. We observe electrowetting and merging of sulfur\u00a0droplets under different potentiostatic conditions, and successfully control these processes via selective design of sulfiphilic\/sulfiphobic substrates. Moreover, we employ the electrowetting phenomena to create a microlens based on the liquid sulfur\u00a0microdroplets and tune its characteristics in real time through changing the shape of the liquid microdroplets in a fast, repeatable, and controlled manner. These studies demonstrate a powerful in situ optical battery platform for unraveling the complex reaction mechanism of sulfur\u00a0chemistries and for exploring the rich material properties of the liquid sulfur, which shed light on the applications of liquid sulfur\u00a0droplets in devices such as microlenses, and potentially other electrotunable and optoelectronic devices.

Journal of the American Chemical Society Siefe, C., Mehlenbacher, R. D., Peng, C. S., Zhang, Y., Fischer, S., Lay, A., McLellan, C. A., Alivisatos, A. P., Chu, S., Dionne, J. A. 2019 Upconverting nanoparticles provide valuable benefits as optical probes for bioimaging and Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, photostability, and biocompatibility; yet, making nanoparticles small yields a significant decay in brightness due to increased surface quenching. Approaches to improve the brightness of UCNPs exist but often require increased nanoparticle size. Here we present a unique core-shell-shell nanoparticle architecture for small (sub-20 nm), bright upconversion with several key features: (1) maximal sensitizer concentration in the core for high near-infrared absorption, (2) efficient energy transfer between core and interior shell for strong emission, and (3) emitter localization near the nanoparticle surface for efficient FRET. This architecture consists of beta-NaYbF4 (core) @NaY0.8-xErxGd0.2F4 (interior shell) @NaY0.8Gd0.2F4 (exterior shell), where sensitizer and emitter ions are partitioned into core and interior shell, respectively. Emitter concentration is varied (x = 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 80%) to investigate influence on single particle brightness, upconversion quantum yield, decay lifetimes, and FRET coupling. We compare these seven samples with the field-standard core-shell architecture of beta-NaY0.58Gd0.2Yb0.2Er0.02F4 (core) @NaY0.8Gd0.2F4 (shell), with sensitizer and emitter ions codoped in the core. At a single particle level, the core-shell-shell design was up to 2-fold brighter than the standard core-shell design. Further, by coupling a fluorescent dye to the surface of the two different architectures, we demonstrated up to 8-fold improved emission enhancement with the core-shell-shell compared to the core-shell design. We show how, given proper consideration for emitter concentration, we can design a unique nanoparticle architecture to yield comparable or improved brightness and FRET coupling within a small volume.

ACS nano Song, G., Zheng, X., Wang, Y., Xia, X., Chu, S., Rao, J. 2019 Multimodality imaging involves the use of more imaging modes to image the same living subjects and is now generally preferred in clinics for cancer imaging. Here we present multimodality-Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Photoacoustic, Fluorescent-nanoparticles (termed MMPF NPs) for imaging tumor xenografts in living mice. MMPF NPs provide long-term (more than 2 months), dynamic, and accurate quantification, in vivo, of NPs and in real time by MPI. Moreover, MMPF NPs offer ultrasensitive MPI imaging of tumors (the tumor ROI increased by 30.6 times over that of preinjection). Moreover, the nanoparticle possessed a long-term blood circulation time (half-life at 49 h) and high tumor uptake (18% ID\/g). MMPF NPs have been demonstrated for imaging breast and brain tumor xenografts in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models in mice via simultaneous MPI, MRI, fluorescence, and photoacoustic imaging with excellent tumor contrast to normal tissues.

S., Joubert, L., Rao, J., Alivisatos, A. P., Macfarlane, R. M., Cohen, B. E., Cui, Y., Dionne, J. A., Chu, S. 2019 Electron microscopy has been instrumental in our understanding of complex biological systems. Although electron microscopy reveals cellular morphology with nanoscale resolution, it does not provide information on the location of different types of proteins. An electron-microscopy-based bioimaging technology capable of localizing individual proteins and resolving protein-protein interactions with respect to cellular ultrastructure would provide important insights into the molecular biology of a cell. Here, we synthesize small lanthanide-doped nanoparticles and measure the absolute photon emission rate of individual nanoparticles resulting from a given electron excitation flux (cathodoluminescence). Our results suggest that the optimization of nanoparticle composition, synthesis protocols and electron imaging conditions can lead to sub-20-nm nanolabels that would enable high signal-to-noise localization of individual biomolecules within a cellular context. In ensemble measurements, these labels exhibit narrow spectra of nine distinct colours, so the imaging of biomolecules in a multicolour electron microscopy modality may be possible.

The sulfur droplets remain liquid at 155 \u00b0C below sulfur's melting point (T m = 115 \u00b0C), with fractional supercooling change (T m - T sc)\/T m larger than 0.40. In operando light microscopy captured the rapid merging and shape relaxation of sulfur droplets, indicating their liquid nature. Micropatterned electrode and electrochemical current allow precise control of the location and size of supercooled microdroplets, respectively. Using this platform, we initiated and observed the rapid solidification of supercooled sulfur microdroplets upon crystalline sulfur touching, which confirms supercooled sulfur's metastability at room temperature. In addition, the formation of liquid sulfur in electrochemical cell enriches lithium-sulfur-electrolyte phase diagram and potentially may create new opportunities for high-energy Li-S batteries.

The experimental results obtained from a tissue mimicking phantom agree quantitatively with numerical simulations of randomly distributed point scatterers. For a fixed axial resolution, the amount of speckle reduction is found to approach a maximum as the number of bands increases while the total spectral range that they cover is kept constant. An analytical solution of the maximal speckle reduction is derived and shows that the maximum improves approximately as the inverse square root of the Gaussian pulse bandwidth. Since the axial resolution is proportional to the inverse of the pulse bandwidth, an optimized trade-off between speckle reduction and axial resolution is obtained. Considerations for the applications of the optimized trade-off are discussed.

Our platform is a single silicon-vacancy center in diamond coupled with a monolithic diamond photonic crystal cavity. The cavity enables an unprecedented frequency tuning range of the Raman emission (100GHz) that significantly exceeds the spectral inhomogeneity of silicon-vacancy centers in diamond nanostructures. We also show that the cavity selectively suppresses the phonon-induced spontaneous emission that degrades the efficiency of Raman photon generation. Our results pave the way towards photon-mediated many-body interactions between solid-state quantum emitters in a nanophotonic platform.

Solid-state color centers are promising candidates for scalable quantum optics due to their long coherence time and small inhomogeneous broadening. However, once excited, color centers often decay through phonon-assisted processes, limiting the efficiency of single-photon generation and photon-mediated entanglement generation. Herein, we demonstrate strong enhancement of spontaneous emission rate of a single silicon-vacancy center in diamond embedded within a monolithic optical cavity, reaching a regime in which the excited-state lifetime is dominated by spontaneous emission into the cavity mode. We observe 10-fold lifetime reduction and 42-fold enhancement in emission intensity when the cavity is tuned into resonance with the optical transition of a single silicon-vacancy center, corresponding to 90% of the excited-state energy decay occurring through spontaneous emission into the cavity mode. We also demonstrate the largest coupling strength (g\/2\u03c0 = 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 GHz) and cooperativity (C = 1.4) to date for color-center-based cavity quantum electrodynamics systems, bringing the system closer to the strong coupling regime.

M., Chu, S. 12 (9) : 548\u201353 Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising single-molecule probes given their non-blinking, photobleach-resistant luminescence upon infrared excitation. However, the weak luminescence of sub-50 nm UCNPs limits their single-particle detection to above 10 kWcm-2 that is impractical for live cell imaging. Here, we systematically characterize single-particle luminescence for UCNPs with various formulations over a 106 variation in incident power, down to 8 Wcm-2. A core-shell-shell (CSS) structure (NaYF4@NaYb1-xF4:Erx@NaYF4) is shown to be significantly brighter than the commonly used NaY0.78F4:Yb0.2Er0.02. At 8 Wcm-2, the 8% Er3+ CSS particles exhibit a 150-fold enhancement given their high sensitizer Yb3+ content and the presence of an inert shell to prevent energy migration to defects. Moreover, we reveal power-dependent luminescence enhancement from the inert shell, which explains the discrepancy in enhancement factors reported by ensemble and previous single-particle measurements. These brighter probes open the possibility of cellular and single-molecule tracking at low irradiance.

Color center-containing nanodiamonds have many applications in quantum technologies and biology. Diamondoids, molecular-sized diamonds have been used as seeds in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth. However, optimizing growth conditions to produce high crystal quality nanodiamonds with color centers requires varying growth conditions that often leads to ad-hoc and time-consuming, one-at-a-time testing of reaction conditions. In order to rapidly explore parameter space, we developed a microwave plasma CVD technique using a vertical, rather than horizontally oriented stage-substrate geometry. With this configuration, temperature, plasma density, and atomic hydrogen density vary continuously along the vertical axis of the substrate. This variation allowed rapid identification of growth parameters that yield single crystal diamonds down to 10 nm in size and 75 nm diameter optically active center silicon-vacancy (Si-V) nanoparticles. Furthermore, this method may provide a means of incorporating a wide variety of dopants in nanodiamonds without ion irradiation damage.

Betavoltaic energy converters (i.e., \u03b2-batteries) are attractive power sources because of their potential for high energy densities (>200\u2009MWh\/kg) and long duration continuous discharge (>1 year). However, conversion efficiencies have been historically low (<3%). High efficiency devices can be achieved by matching \u03b2-radiation transport length scales with the device physics length scales. In this work, the efficiency of c-Si devices using high-energy (>1\u2009MeV) electrons emitted from (90)Sr as a power source is investigated. We propose a design for a >10% efficient betavoltaic device, which generates 1\u2009W of power. A Varian Clinac iX is used to simulate the high-energy electrons emitted from (90)Sr, and a high efficiency c-Si photovoltaic cell is used as the converter. The measured conversion efficiency is 16%. This relatively high value is attributed to proper length scale matching and the generation of secondary electrons in c-Si by the primary \u03b2-particles.

N., Qin, P., Berk, V., Chu, S., Yildiz, A. 164 (4) : 735-746 Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, are shielded against the DNA damage response (DDR) by the shelterin complex. To understand how shelterin protects telomere ends, we investigated the structural organization of telomeric chromatin in human cells using super-resolution microscopy. We found that telomeres form compact globular structures through a complex network of interactions between shelterin subunits and telomeric DNA, but not by DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, or histone trimethylation at telomeres and subtelomeric regions. Mutations that abrogate shelterin assembly or removal of individual subunits from telomeres cause up to a 10-fold increase in telomere volume. Decompacted telomeres accumulate DDR signals and become more accessible to telomere-associated proteins. Recompaction of telomeric chromatin using an orthogonal method displaces DDR signals from telomeres. These results reveal the chromatin remodeling activity of shelterin and demonstrate that shelterin-mediated compaction of telomeric chromatin provides robust protection of chromosome ends against the DDR machinery.

Although it is well established that Ras activity requires binding to both GTP and the membrane, details of how Ras operates on the cell membrane to activate its effectors remain elusive. Efforts to target mutant Ras in human cancers to therapeutic benefit have also been largely unsuccessful. Here we show that Ras-GTP forms dimers to activate MAPK. We used quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to analyze the nanoscale spatial organization of PAmCherry1-tagged KRas 4B (hereafter referred to KRas) on the cell membrane under various signaling conditions. We found that at endogenous expression levels KRas forms dimers, and KRas(G12D), a mutant that constitutively binds GTP, activates MAPK. Overexpression of KRas leads to formation of higher order Ras nanoclusters. Conversely, at lower expression levels, KRas(G12D) is monomeric and activates MAPK only when artificially dimerized. Moreover, dimerization and signaling of KRas are both dependent on an intact CAAX (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic; X, any amino acid) motif that is also known to mediate membrane localization. These results reveal a new, dimerization-dependent signaling mechanism of Ras, and suggest Ras dimers as a potential therapeutic target in mutant Ras-driven tumors.

The uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth that causes a poor cycling performance and serious safety hazards, however, presents a significant challenge for the realization of lithium metal-based batteries. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrode design by placing a three-dimensional (3D) oxidized polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network on top of the current collector. The polymer fiber with polar surface functional groups could guide the lithium ions to form uniform lithium metal deposits confined on the polymer fiber surface and in the 3D polymer layer. We showed stable cycling of lithium metal anode with an average Coulombic efficiency of 97.4% over 120 cycles in ether-based electrolyte at a current density of 3 mA\/cm(2) for a total of 1 mAh\/cm(2) of lithium.

W., Liang, Z., Lee, H., Yan, K., Yao, H., Wang, H., Li, W., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 9 (8) : 618-623 For future applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles and grid storage, batteries with higher energy storage density than existing lithium ion batteries need to be developed. Recent efforts in this direction have focused on high-capacity electrode materials such as lithium metal, silicon and tin as anodes, and sulphur and oxygen as cathodes. Lithium metal would be the optimal choice as an anode material, because it has the highest specific capacity (3,860\u2005mAh\u2005g(-1)) and the lowest anode potential of all. However, the lithium anode forms dendritic and mossy metal deposits, leading to serious safety concerns and low Coulombic efficiency during charge\/discharge cycles. Although advanced characterization techniques have helped shed light on the lithium growth process, effective strategies to improve lithium metal anode cycling remain elusive. Here, we show that coating the lithium metal anode with a monolayer of interconnected amorphous hollow carbon nanospheres helps isolate the lithium metal depositions and facilitates the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase. We show that lithium dendrites do not form up to a practical current density of 1\u2005mA\u2005cm(-2). The Coulombic efficiency improves to \u223c99% for more than 150 cycles. This is significantly better than the bare unmodified samples, which usually show rapid Coulombic efficiency decay in fewer than 100 cycles. Our results indicate that nanoscale interfacial engineering could be a promising strategy to tackle the intrinsic problems of lithium metal anodes.

In this study, we investigated the possible upregulated expression of SLC22A18-induced enhancement of radiosensitivity of human glioma U251 cells in order to provide evidence in support of further clinical investigations. Stably overexpressing SLC22A18 human glioma U251 cells were generated to investigate the effect of SLC22A18 on the sensitivity of cells to irradiation in vitro using clonogenic survival assay. The apoptosis of U251 cells was examined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. DNA damage and repair were measured using \u03b3H2AX foci. The effect of SLC22A18 on the in vivo tumor radiosensitivity was investigated in the orthotopic mice model. Upregulated expression of SLC22A18 enhanced the radiosensitivity of glioma U251 cells and also enhanced irradiation-induced apoptosis of U251 cells, but irradiation-induced apoptosis did not correlate with radiosensitizing effect of upregulated expression of SLC22A18. The repair of irradiation-induced double-strand-breaks was retarded in stably overexpressing SLC22A18 U251 cells. In the orthotopic mice model, the upregulated expression of SLC22A18 in U251 cells enhanced the effect of irradiation treatment and increased the survival time of mice. These results show that upregulated expression of SLC22A18 radiosensitizes human glioma U251 cells by suppressing DNA repair capacity.

A., Lewis, S., Huang, J., Tamgueney, T. M., Liphardt, J. T., McCormick, F., Gray, J. W., Chu, S. 110 (46) : 18519-18524 The RAF serine\/threonine kinases regulate cell growth through the MAPK pathway, and are targeted by small-molecule RAF inhibitors (RAFis) in human cancer. It is now apparent that protein multimers play an important role in RAF activation and tumor response to RAFis. However, the exact stoichiometry and cellular location of these multimers remain unclear because of the lack of technologies to visualize them. In the present work, we demonstrate that photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), in combination with quantitative spatial analysis, provides sufficient resolution to directly visualize protein multimers in cells. Quantitative PALM imaging showed that CRAF exists predominantly as cytoplasmic monomers under resting conditions but forms dimers as well as trimers and tetramers at the cell membrane in the presence of active RAS. In contrast, N-terminal truncated CRAF (CatC) lacking autoinhibitory domains forms constitutive dimers and occasional tetramers in the cytoplasm, whereas a CatC mutant with a disrupted CRAF-CRAF dimer interface does not. Finally, artificially forcing CRAF to the membrane by fusion to a RAS CAAX motif induces multimer formation but activates RAF\/MAPK only if the dimer interface is intact. Together, these quantitative results directly confirm the existence of RAF dimers and potentially higher-order multimers and their involvement in cell signaling, and showed that RAF multimer formation can result from multiple mechanisms and is a critical but not sufficient step for RAF activation.

Remarkably, all instances of Ca(2+)-triggered immediate fusion started from a membrane-membrane point-contact and proceeded to complete fusion without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, pathways that involved a stable hemifusion diaphragm only resulted in fusion after many seconds, if at all. When complexin was included, the Ca(2+)-triggered fusion network shifted towards the immediate pathway, effectively synchronizing fusion, especially at lower Ca(2+)-concentration.

However, a dynamic picture of Pol II transcription initiation and an understanding of the mechanisms of its regulation have remained elusive due in part to inherent limitations of conventional ensemble biochemistry. Here we have begun to dissect promoter-specific transcription initiation directed by a reconstituted human Pol II system at single-molecule resolution using fluorescence video-microscopy. We detected several stochastic rounds of human Pol II transcription from individual DNA templates, observed attenuation of transcription by promoter mutations, observed enhancement of transcription by activator Sp1, and correlated the transcription signals with real-time interactions of holo-TFIID molecules at individual DNA templates. This integrated single-molecule methodology should be applicable to studying other complex biological processes.

N., Hao, Z., Bechtel, H. A., Martin, M. C., Wu, C., Chu, S. 84 (9) : 4118-4125 Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that is essential for the regulation of many important cellular activities, including proliferation and differentiation. Current techniques for detecting protein phosphorylation in single cells often involve the use of fluorescence markers, such as antibodies or genetically expressed proteins. In contrast, infrared spectroscopy is a label-free and noninvasive analytical technique that can monitor the intrinsic vibrational signatures of chemical bonds. Here, we provide direct evidence that protein phosphorylation in individual living mammalian cells can be measured with synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform-infrared (SR-FT-IR) spectromicroscopy. We show that PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth factor (NGF) exhibit statistically significant temporal variations in specific spectral features, correlating with changes in protein phosphorylation levels and the subsequent development of neuron-like phenotypes in the cells. The spectral phosphorylation markers were confirmed by bimodal (FT-IR\/fluorescence) imaging of fluorescently marked PC12 cells with sustained protein phosphorylation activity. Our results open up new possibilities for the label-free real-time monitoring of protein phosphorylation inside cells. Furthermore, the multimolecule sensitivity of this technique will be useful for unraveling the associated molecular changes during cellular signaling and response processes.

C., Hansen, K. C., Chu, S., Brunger, A. T. 50 (46) : 9998-10012 Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is a Ca(2+) sensor for SNARE-mediated, Ca(2+)-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion in neurons. It is composed of luminal, transmembrane, linker, and two Ca(2+)-binding (C2) domains. Here we describe expression and purification of full-length mammalian Syt1 in insect cells along with an extensive biochemical characterization of the purified protein. The expressed and purified protein is properly folded and has increased \u03b1-helical content compared to the C2AB fragment alone. Post-translational modifications of Syt1 were analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing the same modifications of Syt1 that were previously described for Syt1 purified from brain extract or mammalian cell lines, along with a novel modification of Syt1, tyrosine nitration. A lipid binding screen with both full-length Syt1 and the C2AB fragments of Syt1 and Syt3 isoforms revealed new Syt1-lipid interactions. These results suggest a conserved lipid binding mechanism in which Ca(2+)-independent interactions are mediated via a lysine rich region of the C2B domain while Ca(2+)-dependent interactions are mediated via the Ca(2+)-binding loops.

T. 108 (29) : E304-E313 Understanding the molecular principles of synaptic vesicle fusion is a long-sought goal. It requires the development of a synthetic system that allows manipulations and observations not possible in vivo. Here, we report an in vitro system with reconstituted synaptic proteins that meets the long-sought goal to produce fast content release in the millisecond time regime upon Ca(2+) triggering. Our system simultaneously monitors both content and lipid exchange, and it starts from stable interacting pairs of donor and acceptor vesicles, mimicking the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles prior to an action potential. It differentiates between single-vesicle interaction, hemifusion, and complete fusion, the latter mimicking quantized neurotransmitter release upon exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Prior to Ca(2+) injection, the system is in a state in which spontaneous fusion events between donor and acceptor vesicles are rare. Upon Ca(2+) injection, a rapid burst of complete fusion events emerges, followed by a biphasic decay. The present study focuses on neuronal SNAREs, the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin 1, and the modulator complexin. However, other synaptic proteins could be added and their function examined. Ca(2+) triggering is cooperative, requiring the presence of synaptotagmin, whereas SNAREs alone do not produce a fast fusion burst. Manipulations of the system mimic effects observed in vivo. These results also show that neuronal SNAREs alone do not efficiently produce complete fusion, that the combination of SNAREs with synaptotagmin lowers the activation barriers to full fusion, and that complexin enhances this kinetic control.

Distances that are derived from such experiments can be used for determination of the fluorophore positions by triangulation. When combined with a known structure of the macromolecule(s) to which the fluorophores are attached, a three-dimensional model of the system can be determined. However, care has to be taken to properly derive distance from fluorescence energy transfer efficiency and to recognize the systematic or random errors for this relationship. Here we review the experimental and computational methods used for three-dimensional modeling based on single molecule fluorescence resonance transfer, and describe recent progress in pushing the limits of this approach to macromolecular complexes.

If diffraction blurs the image of a point object into an Airy disk with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) size of s = 0.44lambda\/2NA (approximately 90 nm for light with a wavelength of lambda = 600 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of NA = 1.49), limiting the resolution of the far-field microscope in use to d = 2.4s approximately = 200 nm, additional knowledge about the specimen can be used to great advantage. For example, if the source is known to be two spatially resolved fluorescent molecules, the distance between them is given by the separation of the centres of the two fluorescence images. In high-resolution microwave and optical spectroscopy, there are numerous examples where the line centre is determined with a precision of less than 10(-6) of the linewidth. In contrast, in biological applications the brightest single fluorescent emitters can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 100, limiting the centroid localization precision to s(loc) > or = 1% (> or = 1 nm) of the r.m.s. size, s, of the microscope point spread function (PSF). Moreover, the error in co-localizing two or more single emitters is notably worse, remaining greater than 5-10% (5-10 nm) of the PSF size. Here we report a distance resolution of s(reg) = 0.50 nm (1sigma) and an absolute accuracy of s(distance) = 0.77 nm (1sigma) in a measurement of the separation between differently coloured fluorescent molecules using conventional far-field fluorescence imaging in physiological buffer conditions. The statistical uncertainty in the mean for an ensemble of identical single-molecule samples is limited only by the total number of collected photons, to s(loc) approximately 0.3 nm, which is approximately 3 x 10(-3) times the size of the optical PSF. Our method may also be used to improve the resolution of many subwavelength, far-field imaging methods such as those based on co-localization of molecules that are stochastically switched on in space. The improved resolution will allow the structure of large, multisubunit biological complexes in biologically relevant environments to be deciphered at the single-molecule level.

A., Sutton, R. B., Chu, S., Brunger, A. T. 17 (3) : 325-U92 In neurons, SNAREs, synaptotagmin and other factors catalyze Ca(2+)-triggered fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanism of this process, especially the interaction between synaptotagmin and SNAREs, remains an enigma. Here we characterized this interaction by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and crystallography. The two rigid Ca(2+)-binding domains of synaptotagmin 3 (Syt3) undergo large relative motions in solution. Interaction with SNARE complex amplifies a particular state of the two domains that is further enhanced by Ca(2+). This state is represented by the first SNARE-induced Ca(2+)-bound crystal structure of a synaptotagmin fragment containing both domains. The arrangement of the Ca(2+)-binding loops of this structure of Syt3 matches that of SNARE-bound Syt1, suggesting a conserved feature of synaptotagmins. The loops resemble the membrane-interacting loops of certain viral fusion proteins in the postfusion state, suggesting unexpected similarities between both fusion systems.

R. 17 (3) : 318-U84 Synchronous neurotransmission is triggered when Ca(2+) binds to synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1), a synaptic-vesicle protein that interacts with SNAREs and membranes. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between synaptotagmin's two C2 domains to determine that their conformation consists of multiple states with occasional transitions, consistent with domains in random relative motion. SNARE binding results in narrower intrasynaptotagmin FRET distributions and less frequent transitions between states. We obtained an experimentally determined model of the elusive Syt1-SNARE complex using a multibody docking approach with 34 FRET-derived distances as restraints. The Ca(2+)-binding loops point away from the SNARE complex, so they may interact with the same membrane. The loop arrangement is similar to that of the crystal structure of SNARE-induced Ca(2+)-bound Syt3, suggesting a common mechanism by which the interaction between synaptotagmins and SNAREs aids in Ca(2+)-triggered fusion.

V., Greenfeld, M., Chu, S., Herschlag, D. 463 (7281) : 681-U117 According to the 'thermodynamic hypothesis', the sequence of a biological macromolecule defines its folded, active (or 'native') structure as a global energy minimum in the folding landscape. However, the enormous complexity of folding landscapes of large macromolecules raises the question of whether there is in fact a unique global minimum corresponding to a unique native conformation or whether there are deep local minima corresponding to alternative active conformations. The folding of many proteins is well described by two-state models, leading to highly simplified representations of protein folding landscapes with a single native conformation. Nevertheless, accumulating experimental evidence suggests a more complex topology of folding landscapes with multiple active conformations that can take seconds or longer to interconvert. Here we demonstrate, using single-molecule experiments, that an RNA enzyme folds into multiple distinct native states that interconvert on a timescale much longer than that of catalysis. These data demonstrate that severe ruggedness of RNA folding landscapes extends into conformational space occupied by native conformations.

J., Chu, S. 17 (8) : 1075-1081 Cadherins are Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell adhesion proteins with an extracellular region of five domains (EC1 to EC5). Adhesion is mediated by \"strand swapping\" of a conserved tryptophan residue in position 2 between EC1 domains of opposing cadherins, but the formation of this structure is not well understood. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and single-molecule force measurements with the atomic force microscope, we demonstrate that cadherins initially interact via EC1 domains without swapping tryptophan-2 to form a weak Ca(2+) dependent initial encounter complex that has 25% of the bond strength of a strand-swapped dimer. We suggest that cadherin dimerization proceeds via an induced fit mechanism where the monomers first form a tryptophan-2 independent initial encounter complex and then undergo subsequent conformational changes to form the final strand-swapped dimer.

This allows us to surpass the enclosed space-time area of previous interferometers with a splitting of 20variant Planck's over 2pik by a factor of 2500.

Simultaneous acceleration of both arms in the same internal states suppresses systematic effects, and simultaneously running a pair of interferometers suppresses the effect of vibrations. Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 interferometers using four such Bloch-Bragg-Bloch beam splitters exhibit 15% contrast at 24variant Planck's over 2pik splitting, the largest so far (variant Planck's over 2pik is the photon momentum); single beam splitters achieve 88variant Planck's over 2pik. The prospects for reaching 100 s of variant Planck's over 2pik and applications such as gravitational wave sensors are discussed.

J., Chu, S. 106 (1) : 109-114 The cadherin family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion proteins are critical for the morphogenesis and functional organization of tissues in multicellular organisms, but the molecular interactions between cadherins that are at the core of cell-cell adhesion are a matter of considerable debate. A widely-accepted model is that cadherins adhere in 3 stages. First, the functional unit of cadherin adhesion is a cis dimer formed by the binding of the extracellular regions of 2 cadherins on the same cell surface. Second, formation of low-affinity trans interactions between cadherin cis dimers on opposing cell surfaces initiates cell-cell adhesion. Third, lateral clustering of cadherins cooperatively strengthens intercellular adhesion. Evidence of these cadherin binding states during adhesion is, however, contradictory, and evidence for cooperativity is lacking. We used single-molecule structural (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) and functional (atomic force microscopy) assays to demonstrate directly that cadherin monomers interact via their N-terminal EC1 domain to form trans adhesive complexes. We could not detect the formation of cadherin cis dimers, but found that increasing the density of cadherin monomers cooperatively increased the probability of trans adhesive binding.

T., Weninger, K., Bowen, M., Chu, S. 78 : 903-928 SNAREs are essential components of the machinery for Ca(2+)-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, resulting in neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Although much is known about their biophysical and structural properties and their interactions with accessory proteins such as the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin, their precise role in membrane fusion remains an enigma. Ensemble studies of liposomes with reconstituted SNAREs have demonstrated that SNAREs and accessory proteins can trigger lipid mixing\/fusion, but the inability to study individual fusion events has precluded molecular insights into the fusion process. Thus, this field is ripe for studies with single-molecule methodology. In this review, we discuss applications of single-molecule approaches to observe reconstituted SNAREs, their complexes, associated proteins, and their effect on biological membranes. Some of the findings are provocative, such as the possibility of parallel and antiparallel SNARE complexes or of vesicle docking with only syntaxin and synaptobrevin, but have been confirmed by other experiments.

D., Zhao, W., Travers, K., Chut, S., Herschlag, D. 130 (19) : 6085-? All structured biological macromolecules must overcome the thermodynamic folding problem to populate a unique functional state among a vast ensemble of unfolded and alternate conformations. The exploration of cooperativity in protein folding has helped reveal and distinguish the underlying mechanistic solutions to this folding problem. Analogous dissections of RNA tertiary stability remain elusive, however, despite the central biological importance of folded RNA molecules and the potential to reveal fundamental properties of structured macromolecules via comparisons of protein and RNA folding. We report a direct quantitative measure of tertiary contact cooperativity in a folded RNA. We precisely measured the stability of an independently folding P4-P6 domain from the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron by single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Using wild-type and mutant RNAs, we found that cooperativity between the two tertiary contacts enhances P4-P6 stability by 3.2 +\/- 0.2 kcal\/mol.

Relative to the 2-photon processes used in the most sensitive present interferometers, these large momentum transfer beam splitters increase the phase shift 12-fold for Mach-Zehnder (MZ) and 144-fold for Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 (RB) geometries. We achieve a high visibility of the interference fringes (up to 52% for MZ or 36% for RB) and long pulse separation times that are possible only in atomic fountain setups. As the atom's internal state is not changed, important systematic effects can cancel.

E., Choi, U. B., Chu, S., Brunger, A. T. 16 (2) : 308-320 Syntaxin\/SNAP-25 interactions precede assembly of the ternary SNARE complex that is essential for neurotransmitter release. This binary complex has been difficult to characterize by bulk methods because of the prevalence of a 2:1 dead-end species. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence, we find the structure of the 1:1 syntaxin\/SNAP-25 binary complex is variable, with states changing on the second timescale. One state corresponds to a parallel three-helix bundle, whereas other states show one of the SNAP-25 SNARE domains dissociated. Adding synaptobrevin suppresses the dissociated helix states. Remarkably, upon addition of complexin, Munc13, Munc18, or synaptotagmin, a similar effect is observed. Thus, the 1:1 binary complex is a dynamic acceptor for synaptobrevin binding, and accessory proteins stabilize this acceptor. In the cellular environment the binary complex is actively maintained in a configuration where it can rapidly interact with synaptobrevin, so formation is not likely a limiting step for neurotransmitter release.

D. 13 (12) : 2091-2097 Ribosome-stimulated hydrolysis of guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) by guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) translation factors drives protein synthesis by the ribosome. Allosteric coupling of GTP hydrolysis by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) at the ribosomal GTPase center to messenger RNA (mRNA) codon:aminoacyl-transfer RNA (aa-tRNA) anticodon recognition at the ribosomal decoding site is essential for accurate and rapid aa-tRNA selection. Here we use single-molecule methods to investigate the mechanism of action of the antibiotic thiostrepton and show that the GTPase center of the ribosome has at least two discrete functions during aa-tRNA selection: binding of EF-Tu(GTP) and stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by the factor. We separate these two functions of the GTPase center and assign each to distinct, conserved structural regions of the ribosome. The data provide a specific model for the coupling between the decoding site and the GTPase center during aa-tRNA selection as well as a general mechanistic model for ribosome-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by GTPase translation factors.

This stabilization is based on the observation that the frequency or amplitude noise of the ECDL is lowest at the optimum laser diode temperature or injection current. Thus, keeping the diode current at the level where the noise is lowest ensures mode-hop-free operation within one of the stable regions of the mode chart, even if these should drift due to external influences. This method can be applied directly to existing laser systems without modifying the optical setup. We demonstrate the method in two ECDLs stabilized to vapor cells at 852 and 895 nm wavelengths. We achieve long-term mode-hop-free operation and low noise at low power consumption, even with an inexpensive non-antireflection-coated diode.

D., Chu, S. 93 (10) : 3575-3582 Adjacent transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in the A- and P-sites of the ribosome are in dynamic equilibrium between two different conformations called classical and hybrid states before translocation. Here, we have used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study the effect of Mg(2+) on tRNA dynamics with and without an acetyl group on the A-site tRNA. When the A-site tRNA is not acetylated, tRNA dynamics do not depend on [Mg(2+)], indicating that the relative positions of the substrates for peptide-bond formation are not affected by Mg(2+). In sharp contrast, when the A-site tRNA is acetylated, Mg(2+) lengthens the lifetime of the classical state but does not change the lifetime of the hybrid state. Based on these findings, the classical state resembles a state with direct stabilization of tertiary structure by Mg(2+) ions whereas the hybrid state resembles a state with little Mg(2+)-assisted stabilization. The antibiotic viomycin, a translocation inhibitor, suppresses tRNA dynamics, suggesting that the enhanced fluctuations of tRNAs after peptide-bond formation drive spontaneous attempts at translocation by the ribosome.

M., Valletta, J. S., Liu, J., Yang, Y., Chu, S., Mobley, W. C. 8 (11) : 1503-1520 Rap1 transduces nerve growth factor (NGF)\/tyrosine receptor kinase A (TrkA) signaling in early endosomes, leading to sustained activation of the p44\/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK1\/2). However, the mechanisms by which NGF, TrkA and Rap1 are trafficked to early endosomes are poorly defined. We investigated trafficking and signaling of NGF, TrkA and Rap1 in PC12 cells and in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Herein, we show a role for both microtubule- and dynein-based transport in NGF signaling through MAPK1\/2. NGF treatment resulted in trafficking of NGF, TrkA and Rap1 to early endosomes in the perinuclear region of PC12 cells where sustained activation of MAPK1\/2 was observed. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole in PC12 cells had no effect on the activation of TrkA and Ras. However, it disrupted intracellular trafficking of TrkA and Rap1. Moreover, NGF-induced activation of Rap1 and sustained activation of MAPK1\/2 were markedly suppressed. Inhibition of dynein activity through overexpression of dynamitin (p50) blocked trafficking of Rap1 and the sustained phase of MAPK1\/2 activation in PC12 cells. Remarkably, even in the continued presence of NGF, mature DRG neurons that overexpressed p50 became atrophic and most (>80%) developing DRG neurons died. Dynein- and microtubule-based transport is thus necessary for TrkA signaling to Rap1 and MAPK1\/2.

The nanoparticle mediated bonding has several advantages to currently used optical joining technologies. The bonding is a room-temperature process and does not require any clean room facilities. The bonded interface has a high mechanical strength and low scattering. The bonding is resistant to organic solvents on silylation with hydrophobic surface groups. This method achieves 100% successful bonding rates between soda-lime glass slides. The bond-setting time can be tailored to allow time for precision optical alignment.

L., Li, W., Mobley, W. C., Chu, S. 104 (34) : 13666-13671 Retrograde axonal transport of nerve growth factor (NGF) signals is critical for the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of peripheral sympathetic and sensory neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. However, the mechanisms by which the NGF signal is propagated from the axon terminal to the cell body are yet to be fully elucidated. To gain insight into the mechanisms, we used quantum dot-labeled NGF (QD-NGF) to track the movement of NGF in real time in compartmentalized culture of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Our studies showed that active transport of NGF within the axons was characterized by rapid, unidirectional movements interrupted by frequent pauses. Almost all movements were retrograde, but short-distance anterograde movements were occasionally observed. Surprisingly, quantitative analysis at the single molecule level demonstrated that the majority of NGF-containing endosomes contained only a single NGF dimer. Electron microscopic analysis of axonal vesicles carrying QD-NGF confirmed this finding. The majority of QD-NGF was found to localize in vesicles 50-150 nm in diameter with a single lumen and no visible intralumenal membranous components. Our findings point to the possibility that a single NGF dimer is sufficient to sustain signaling during retrograde axonal transport to the cell body.

C., Kim, H. D., Puglisi, J. D., Chu, S. 104 (34) : 13661-13665 The detailed mechanism of how the ribosome decodes protein sequence information with an abnormally high accuracy, after 40 years of study, remains elusive. A critical element in selecting correct transfer RNA (tRNA) transferring correct amino acid is \"induced fit\" between the ribosome and tRNA. By using single-molecule methods, the induced fit mechanism is shown to position favorably the correct tRNA after initial codon recognition. We provide evidence that this difference in positioning and thermal fluctuations constitutes the primary mechanism for the initial selection of tRNA. This work demonstrates thermal fluctuations playing a critical role in the substrate selection by an enzyme.

J., Herschlag, D., Chu, S. 92 (9) : 3275-3283 We describe a new, time-apertured photon correlation method for resolving the transition time between two states of RNA in folding--i.e., the time of the transition between states rather than the time spent in each state. Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are used to obtain these measurements. Individual RNA molecules are labeled with fluorophores such as Cy3 and Cy5. Those molecules are then immobilized on a surface and observed for many seconds during which time the molecules spontaneously switch between two conformational states with different levels of flourescence resonance energy transfer efficiency. Single photons are counted from each fluorophore and cross correlated in a small window around a transition. The average of over 1000 cross correlations can be fit to a polynomial, which can determine transition times as short as the average photon emission interval. We applied the method to the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I self-splicing intron to yield the folding transition time of 240 micros. The unfolding time is found to be too short to measure with this method.

D., Puglisi, J. D., Chu, S. 446 (7134) : 454-457 The ribosome is a molecular machine that translates the genetic code contained in the messenger RNA into an amino acid sequence through repetitive cycles of transfer RNA selection, peptide bond formation and translocation. Here we demonstrate an optical tweezer assay to measure the rupture force between a single ribosome complex and mRNA. The rupture force was compared between ribosome complexes assembled on an mRNA with and without a strong Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence-a sequence found just upstream of the coding region of bacterial mRNAs, involved in translation initiation. The removal of the SD sequence significantly reduced the rupture force in complexes carrying an aminoacyl tRNA, Phe-tRNA(Phe), in the A site, indicating that the SD interactions contribute significantly to the stability of the ribosomal complex on the mRNA before peptide bond formation. In contrast, the presence of a peptidyl tRNA analogue, N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA(Phe), in the A site, which mimicked the post-peptidyl transfer state, weakened the rupture force as compared to the complex with Phe-tRNA(Phe), and the resultant force was the same for both the SD-containing and SD-deficient mRNAs. These results suggest that formation of the first peptide bond destabilizes the SD interaction, resulting in the weakening of the force with which the ribosome grips an mRNA. This might be an important requirement to facilitate movement of the ribosome along mRNA during the first translocation step.

C., Yang, Y. 104 (7) : 2223-2228 Retrograde axonal transport plays an important role in the maintenance of neuronal functions, but the mechanism is poorly defined partly because the constituents of the retrograde transport system and their interactions have yet to be elucidated. Of special interest is how dynein\/dynactin motor proteins interact with membrane cargoes. Here, we report that an endosomal vesicle protein, termed retrolinkin, functions as a receptor tethering vesicles to dynein\/dynactin through BPAG1n4. Retrolinkin, a membrane protein highly enriched in neuronal endosomes, binds directly to BPAG1n4. Deletion of retrolinkin membrane-association domains disrupts retrograde vesicular transport, recapitulating the BPAG1 null phenotype. We propose that retrolinkin acts with BPAG1n4 to specifically regulate retrograde axonal transport. Our work lays the foundation for understanding fundamental issues of axonal transport and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying human neurodegenerative disorders.

M. 15 (9) : 1451-1463 Mutations in gigaxonin were identified in giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), an autosomal recessive disorder. To understand how disruption of gigaxonin's function leads to neurodegeneration, we ablated the gene expression in mice using traditional gene targeting approach. Progressive neurological phenotypes and pathological lesions that developed in the GAN null mice recapitulate characteristic human GAN features. The disruption of gigaxonin results in an impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system leading to a substantial accumulation of a novel microtubule-associated protein, MAP8, in the null mutants. Accumulated MAP8 alters the microtubule network, traps dynein motor protein in insoluble structures and leads to neuronal death in cultured wild-type neurons, which replicates the process occurring in GAN null mutants. Defective axonal transport is evidenced by the in vitro assays and is supported by vesicular accumulation in the GAN null neurons. We propose that the axonal transport impairment may be a deleterious consequence of accumulated, toxic MAP8 protein.

We give tight upper and lower bounds for Gamma when the polyion can be modeled by a cylinder of infinite length but of arbitrary charge density. This case can be used as a model for long strands of DNA or RNA in an aqueous solution containing univalent cations. The salt dependence of Gamma is predicted from low to intermediate and high salt concentrations. We also indicate how the bounds for the infinite polyion can be exploited to place bounds for polyions of length greater than a constant on the order of the inverse Debye screening length.

The effect is explained by narrowband parametric amplification of Bloch waves from noise, due to phase-matched scattering of atom pairs out of the condensate.

E., Weninger, K., Ernst, J., Chu, S., Brunger, A. T. 89 (1) : 690-702 The assembly of multiprotein complexes at the membrane interface governs many signaling processes in cells. However, very few methods exist for obtaining biophysical information about protein complex formation at the membrane. We used single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study complexin and synaptotagmin interactions with the SNARE complex in deposited lipid bilayers. Using total internal reflectance microscopy, individual binding events at the membrane could be resolved despite an excess of unbound protein in solution. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-efficiency derived distances for the complexin-SNARE interaction were consistent with the crystal structure of the complexin-SNARE complex. The unstructured N-terminal region of complexin showed broad distributions of FRET efficiencies to the SNARE complex, suggesting that information on conformational variability can be obtained from FRET efficiency distributions. The low-affinity interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNARE complex changed dramatically upon addition of Ca2+ with high FRET efficiency interactions appearing between the C2B domain and linker domains of synaptotagmin and the membrane proximal portion of the SNARE complex. These results demonstrate that single molecule FRET can be used as a \"spectroscopic ruler\" to simultaneously gain structural and kinetic information about transient multiprotein complexes at the membrane interface.

D. : 182-189 Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy can reveal mechanistic and kinetic details that may not be observed in static structural and bulk biochemical studies of protein synthesis. One approach requires site-specific and stable attachment of fluorophores to the components of translation machinery. Fluorescent tagging of the ribosome is a prerequisite for the observation of dynamic changes in ribosomal conformation during translation using fluorescence methods. Modifications of the ribosomal particle are difficult due to its complexity and high degree of sequence and structural conservation. We have developed a general method to label specifically the prokaryotic ribosome by hybridization of fluorescent oligonucleotides to mutated ribosomal RNA. Functional, modified ribosomes can be purified as a homogenous population, and fluorescence can be monitored from labeled ribosomal complexes immobilized on a derivatized quartz surface.

E., Weninger, K., Brunger, A. T., Chu, S. 87 (5) : 3569-3584 A single molecule fluorescence assay is presented for studying the mechanism of soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs)-mediated liposome fusion to supported lipid bilayers. The three neuronal SNAREs syntaxin-1A, synaptobrevin-II (VAMP), and SNAP-25A were expressed separately, and various dye-labeled combinations of the SNAREs were tested for their ability to dock liposomes and induce fusion. Syntaxin and synaptobrevin in opposing membranes were both necessary and sufficient to dock liposomes to supported bilayers and to induce thermally activated fusion. As little as one SNARE interaction was sufficient for liposome docking. Fusion of docked liposomes with the supported bilayer was monitored by the dequenching of soluble fluorophores entrapped within the liposomes. Fusion was stimulated by illumination with laser light, and the fusion probability was enhanced by raising the ambient temperature from 22 to 37 degrees C, suggesting a thermally activated process. Surprisingly, SNAP-25 had little effect on docking efficiency or the probability of thermally induced fusion. Interprotein fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments suggest the presence of other conformational states of the syntaxin*synaptobrevin interaction in addition to those observed in the crystal structure of the SNARE complex. Furthermore, although SNARE complexes involved in liposome docking preferentially assemble into a parallel configuration, both parallel and antiparallel configurations were observed.

C., Gonzalez, R. L., Kim, H. D., Chu, S., Puglisi, J. D. 11 (10) : 1008-1014 Using single-molecule methods we observed the stepwise movement of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) into the ribosome during selection and kinetic proofreading using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Intermediate states in the pathway of tRNA delivery were observed using antibiotics and nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs. We identified three unambiguous FRET states corresponding to initial codon recognition, GTPase-activated and fully accommodated states. The antibiotic tetracycline blocks progression of aa-tRNA from the initial codon recognition state, whereas cleavage of the sarcin-ricin loop impedes progression from the GTPase-activated state. Our data support a model in which ribosomal recognition of correct codon-anticodon pairs drives rotational movement of the incoming complex of EF-Tu-GTP-aa-tRNA toward peptidyl-tRNA during selection on the ribosome. We propose a mechanistic model of initial selection and proofreading. DOI 10.1038\/nsmb831 PubMedID 15448679 Precision Feshbach spectroscopy of ultracold Cs-2 Chin, C., Vuletic, V., Kerman, A.

D., Chu, S. 101 (35) : 12893-12898 Using single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved conformational changes between fluorescently labeled tRNA have been characterized within surface-immobilized ribosomes proceeding through a complete cycle of translation elongation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to observe aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) stably accommodating into the aminoacyl site (A site) of the ribosome via a multistep, elongation factor-Tu dependent process. Subsequently, tRNA molecules, bound at the peptidyl site and A site, fluctuate between two configurations assigned as classical and hybrid states. The lifetime of classical and hybrid states, measured for complexes carrying aa-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA at the A site, shows that peptide bond formation decreases the lifetime of the classical-state tRNA configuration by approximately 6-fold. These data suggest that the growing peptide chain plays a role in modulating fluctuations between hybrid and classical states. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer was also used to observe aa-tRNA accommodation coupled with elongation factor G-mediated translocation. Dynamic rearrangements in tRNA configuration are also observed subsequent to the translocation reaction. This work underscores the importance of dynamics in ribosome function and demonstrates single-particle enzymology in a system of more than two components.

Data were collected by using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Some factors related to low bone mass, including number of fractures since age 45 years and low dietary calcium intake, were associated with increased risks of fracture, and factors thought to protect against bone loss, such as menopausal hormone therapy and calcium carbonate tablet use, were associated with reduced risks. Fall-related risk factors included previous falls, diabetes mellitus, and difficulty walking in dim light. Possible fall-related risk factors suggested for the first time in this study were seizure medication use (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45, 5.42), depression (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.84), almost always using a hearing aid (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.31 vs. never prescribed), and left-handedness (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.51, 3.68 vs. right-handedness). Difficulty with activities of daily living and lack of physical activity tended to be associated with increased risk. Prevention of falls among frail, osteoporotic persons would likely reduce the frequency of proximal humerus fracture.

T. 100 (25) : 14800-14805 Vesicle fusion in eukaryotes is thought to involve the assembly of a highly conserved family of proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) into a highly stable parallel four-helix bundle. We have used intermolecular single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to characterize preassembled neuronal SNARE complexes consisting of syntaxin, synaptobrevin, and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa on deposited lipid bilayers. Surprisingly, we found a mixture of parallel as well as antiparallel configurations involving the SNARE motifs of syntaxin and synaptobrevin as well as those of syntaxin and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa. The subpopulation with the parallel four-helix bundle configuration could be greatly enriched by an additional purification step in the presence of denaturant, indicating that the parallel configuration is the energetically most favorable state. Interconversion between the configurations was not observed. From this observation, we infer the conversion rate to be <1.5 h-1. The existence of antiparallel configurations suggests a regulatory role of chaperones, such as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, or the membrane environment during SNARE complex assembly in vivo, and it could be a partial explanation for the relatively slow rates of vesicle fusion observed by reconstituted fusion experiments in vitro.

M., Ha, T., Chu, S., Boxer, S. G. 83 (6) : 3371-3379 We have developed a single vesicle assay to study the mechanisms of supported bilayer formation. Fluorescently labeled, unilamellar vesicles (30-100 nm diameter) were first adsorbed to a quartz surface at low enough surface concentrations to visualize single vesicles. Fusion and rupture events during the bilayer formation, induced by the subsequent addition of unlabeled vesicles, were detected by measuring two-color fluorescence signals simultaneously. Lipid-conjugated dyes monitored the membrane fusion while encapsulated dyes reported on the vesicle rupture. Four dominant pathways were observed, each exhibiting characteristic two-color fluorescence signatures: 1) primary fusion, in which an unlabeled vesicle fuses with a labeled vesicle on the surface, is signified by the dequenching of the lipid-conjugated dyes followed by rupture and final merging into the bilayer; 2) simultaneous fusion and rupture, in which a labeled vesicle on the surface ruptures simultaneously upon fusion with an unlabeled vesicle; 3) no dequenching, in which loss of fluorescence signal from both dyes occur simultaneously with the final merger into the bilayer; and 4) isolated rupture (pre-ruptured vesicles), in which a labeled vesicle on the surface spontaneously undergoes content loss, a process that occurs with high efficiency in the presence of a high concentration of Texas Red-labeled lipids. Vesicles that have undergone content loss appear to be more fusogenic than intact vesicles.

P., Chu, S. 66 (1) We examine the dynamics of DNA molecules in mixed flows where the ratio of vorticity to strain rate may be slightly above or below unity via Brownian dynamics simulation. We find that the chain dynamics in these flows are dramatically different than those found for simple shear flow. When the strain rate exceeds vorticity, the dynamics are found to be driven by the extra amount of straining. For vorticity-dominated flows, a periodicity in chain extension is observed with considerable chain deformation.

J., Babcock, H. P., Walter, N. G., Chu, S. 296 (5572) : 1473-1476 We have studied the correlation between structural dynamics and function of the hairpin ribozyme. The enzyme-substrate complex exists in either docked (active) or undocked (inactive) conformations. Using single-molecule fluorescence methods, we found complex structural dynamics with four docked states of distinct stabilities and a strong memory effect where each molecule rarely switches between different docked states. We also found substrate cleavage to be rate-limited by a combination of conformational transitions and reversible chemistry equilibrium. The complex structural dynamics quantitatively explain the heterogeneous cleavage kinetics common to many catalytic RNAs. The intimate coupling of structural dynamics and function is likely a general phenomenon for RNA.

D., Nienhaus, G. U., Ha, T., Orr, J. W., Williamson, J. R., Chu, S. 99 (7) : 4284-4289 Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) on immobilized individual fluorophores was used to study the Mg2+-facilitated conformational change of an RNA three-helix junction, a structural element that initiates the folding of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Transitions of the RNA junction between open and folded conformations resulted in fluctuations in fluorescence by FRET. Fluorescence fluctuations occurring between two FRET states on the millisecond time scale were found to be dependent on Mg2+ and Na+ concentrations. Correlation functions of the fluctuations were used to determine transition rates between the two conformations as a function of Mg2+ or Na+ concentration. Both the opening and folding rates were found to vary with changing salt conditions. Assuming specific binding of divalent ions to RNA, the Mg2+ dependence of the observed rates cannot be explained by conformational change induced by Mg2+ binding\/unbinding, but is consistent with a model in which the intrinsic conformational change of the RNA junction is altered by uptake of Mg2+ ion(s). This version of FCS\/FRET on immobilized single molecules is demonstrated to be a powerful technique in the study of conformational dynamics of biomolecules over time scales ranging from microseconds to seconds.

W., Babcock, H. P., Millett, I. S., Doniach, S., Chu, S., Herschlag, D. 99 (1) : 155-160 Structured RNAs achieve their active states by traversing complex, multidimensional energetic landscapes. Here we probe the folding landscape of the Tetrahymena ribozyme by using a powerful approach: the folding of single ribozyme molecules is followed beginning from distinct regions of the folding landscape. The experiments, combined with small-angle x-ray scattering results, show that the landscape contains discrete folding pathways. These pathways are separated by large free-energy barriers that prevent interconversion between them, indicating that the pathways lie in deep channels in the folding landscape. Chemical protection and mutagenesis experiments are then used to elucidate the structural features that determine which folding pathway is followed. Strikingly, a specific long-range tertiary contact can either help folding or hinder folding, depending on when it is formed during the process. Together these results provide an unprecedented view of the topology of an RNA folding landscape and the RNA structural features that underlie this multidimensional landscape.

W., Ha, T., Kim, H. D., Centner, T., Labeit, S., Chu, S. 97 (26) : 14241-14244 By using titin as a model system, we have demonstrated that fluorescence quenching can be used to study protein folding at the single molecule level. The unfolded titin molecules with multiple dye molecules attached are able to fold to the native state. In the native folded state, the fluorescence from dye molecules is quenched due to the close proximity between the dye molecules. Unfolding of the titin leads to a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity. Such a change makes the folded and unfolded states of a single titin molecule clearly distinguishable and allows us to measure the folding dynamics of individual titin molecules in real time. We have also shown that fluorescence quenching can signal folding and unfolding of a small protein with only one immunoglobulin domain.

J., Herschlag, D., Chu, S. 288 (5473) : 2048-? Using fluorescence microscopy, we studied the catalysis by and folding of individual Tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme molecules. The dye-labeled and surface-immobilized ribozymes used were shown to be functionally indistinguishable from the unmodified free ribozyme in solution. A reversible local folding step in which a duplex docks and undocks from the ribozyme core was observed directly in single-molecule time trajectories, allowing the determination of the rate constants and characterization of the transition state. A rarely populated docked state, not measurable by ensemble methods, was observed. In the overall folding process, intermediate folding states and multiple folding pathways were observed. In addition to observing previously established folding pathways, a pathway with an observed folding rate constant of 1 per second was discovered. These results establish single-molecule fluorescence as a powerful tool for examining RNA folding.

More than 25 resonances are observed for magnetic fields up to 230 G and their positions are measured with an accuracy down to 0.03 G. From these spectra several ground-state molecular interaction parameters can be extracted with sufficient accuracy to permit for the first time an unambiguous and accurate determination of cesium's ultracold collision properties [P.

The moving particle modifies the field inside a cavity with a time delay characteristic of the cavity linewidth, while the field acts on the particle via the light shift. The dissipative mechanism can be interpreted as Doppler cooling based on preferential scattering rather than preferential absorption. It depends on particle properties only through the coherent scattering rate, opening new possibilities for optically cooling molecules or interacting atoms.

The technique is based on 3D degenerate Raman sideband cooling in optical lattices and remains efficient even at densities where the mean lattice site occupation is close to unity.

D., Orr, J. W., Williamson, J. R., Chu, S. 96 (16) : 9077-9082 We present the first demonstration that fluorescence resonance energy transfer can be used to track the motion of a single molecule undergoing conformational changes. As a model system, the conformational changes of individual three-helix junction RNA molecules induced by the binding of ribosomal protein S15 or Mg(2+) ions were studied by changes in single-molecule fluorescence. The transition from an open to a folded configuration was monitored by the change of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two different dye molecules attached to the ends of two helices in the RNA junction. Averaged behavior of RNA molecules closely resembles that of unlabeled molecules in solution determined by other bulk assays, proving that this approach is viable and suggesting new opportunities for studying protein-nucleic acids interactions. Surprisingly, we observed an anomalously broad distribution of RNA conformations at intermediate ion concentrations that may be attributed to foldability differences among RNA molecules. In addition, an experimental scheme was developed where the real-time response of single molecules can be followed under changing environments. As a demonstration, we repeatedly changed Mg(2+) concentration in the buffer while monitoring single RNA molecules and showed that individual RNA molecules can measure the instantaneous Mg(2+) concentration with 20-ms time resolution, making it the world's smallest Mg(2+) meter.

The probability distribution for the molecular extension was determined as a function of shear rate, gamma;, for two different polymer relaxation times, tau. In contrast to the behavior in pure elongational flow, the average polymer extension in shear flow does not display a sharp coil-stretch transition. Large, aperiodic temporal fluctuations were observed, consistent with end-over-end tumbling of the molecule. The rate of these fluctuations (relative to the relaxation rate) increased as the Weissenberg number, gamma;tau, was increased.

E., Chu, S. 281 (5381) : 1335\u201340 Individual polymers at thermal equilibrium were exposed to an elongational flow producing a high strain rate, and their dynamics were recorded with video fluorescence microscopy. The flow was turned on suddenly so that the entire evolution of molecular conformation could be observed without initial perturbations. The rate of stretching of individual molecules is highly variable and depends on the molecular conformation that develops during stretching. This variability is due to a dependence of the dynamics on the initial, random equilibrium conformation of the polymer coil. The increasing appearance at high strain rates of slowly unraveling hairpin folds is an example of nonergodic dynamics, which can occur when a statistical mechanical system is subjected to nonadiabatic, or \"sudden,\" external forces. PubMedID 9721095 The dynamics of partially extended single molecules of DNA Quake, S. R., Babcock, H., Chu, S. 388 (6638) : 151-154 The behaviour of an isolated polymer floating in a solvent forms the basis of our understanding of polymer dynamics. Classical theories describe the motion of a polymer with linear equations of motion, which yield a set of 'normal modes', analogous to the fundamental frequency and the harmonics of a vibrating violin string. But hydrodynamic interactions make polymer dynamics inherently nonlinear, and the linearizing approximations required for the normal-mode picture have therefore been questioned. Here we test the normal-mode theory by measuring the fluctuations of single molecules of DNA held in a partially extended state with optical tweezers. We find that the motion of the DNA can be described by linearly independent normal modes, and we have experimentally determined the eigenstates of the system. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of relaxation times obeys a power law. Web of Science ID A1997XK10900043 PubMedID 9217154 Single polymer dynamics in an elongational flow Perkins, T. T., Smith, D. E., Chu, S. 276 (5321) : 2016-2021 The stretching of individual polymers in a spatially homogeneous velocity gradient was observed through use of fluorescently labeled DNA molecules. The probability distribution of molecular extension was determined as a function of time and strain rate. Although some molecules reached steady state, the average extension did not, even after a approximately 300-fold distortion of the underlying fluid element. At the highest strain rates, distinct conformational shapes with differing dynamics were observed. There was considerable variation in the onset of stretching, and chains with a dumbbell shape stretched more rapidly than folded ones. As the strain rate was increased, chains did not deform with the fluid element. The steady-state extension can be described by a model consisting of two beads connected by a spring representing the entropic elasticity of a worm-like chain, but the average dynamics cannot.

E. 119 (2) : 189-201 This is the first report of bioreactive self-assembled monolayers, covalently bound to atomically flat silicon surfaces and capable of binding biomolecules for investigation by scanning probe microscopy and other surface-related assays and sensing devices. These monolayers are stable under a wide range of conditions and allow tailor-made functionalization for many purposes. We describe the substrate preparation and present an STM and SFM characterization, partly performed with multiwalled carbon nanotubes as tapping-mode supertips. Furthermore, we present two strategies of introducing in situ reactive headgroup functionalities. One method entails a free radical chlorosulfonation process with subsequent sulfonamide formation. A second method employs singlet carbenemediated hydrogen-carbon insertion of a heterobifunctional, amino-reactive trifluoromethyl-diazirinyl crosslinker. We believe that this new substrate is advantageous to others, because it (i) is atomically flat over large areas and can be prepared in a few hours with standard equipment, (ii) is stable under most conditions, (iii) can be modified to adjust a certain degree of reactivity and hydrophobicity, which allows physical adsorption or covalent crosslinking of the biological specimen, (iv) builds the bridge between semiconductor microfabrication and organic\/biological molecular systems, and (v) is accessible to nanopatterning and applications requiring conductive substrates.

T., Chu, S., Spudich, J. A. 70 (4) : 1813-1822 We combined a single-beam gradient optical trap with a high-resolution photodiode position detector to show that an optical trap can be used to make quantitative measurements of nanometer displacements and piconewton forces with millisecond resolution. When an external force is applied to a micron-sized bead held by an optical trap, the bead is displaced from the center of the trap by an amount proportional to the applied force. When the applied force is changed rapidly, the rise time of the displacement is on the millisecond time scale, and thus a trapped bead can be used as a force transducer. The performance can be enhanced by a feedback circuit so that the position of the trap moves by means of acousto-optic modulators to exert a force equal and opposite to the external force applied to the bead. In this case the position of the trap can be used to measure the applied force. We consider parameters of the trapped bead such as stiffness and response time as a function of bead diameter and laser beam power and compare the results with recent ray-optic calculations.

Molecules ranging in length (L) from 22 to 84 micrometers were held stationary against the flow by the optical trapping of a latex microsphere attached to one end. The fractional extension x\/L is a universal function of eta vL 0.54 +\/- 0.05, where eta and v are the viscosity and velocity of the flow, respectively. This relation shows that the DNA is not \"free-draining\" (that is, hydrodynamic coupling within the chain is not negligible) even near full extension (approximately 80 percent). This function has the same form over a long range as the fractional extension versus force applied at the ends of a worm-like chain. For small deformations (< 30 percent of full extension), the extension increases with velocity as x approximately v0.70 +\/- 0.08. The relative size of fluctuations in extension decreases as sigma x\/x approximately equal to 0.42 exp (-4.9 x\/L). Video images of the fluctuating chain have a cone-like envelope and show a sharp increase in intensity at the free end.

Inverse Laplace transformations of the relaxation data yielded spectra of decaying exponentials with distinct peaks, and the longest time component (tau) increased with length (L) as tau approximately L 1.68 +\/- 0.10.

E., Chu, S. 264 (5160) : 819-822 Tube-like motion of a single, fluorescently labeled molecule of DNA in an entangled solution of unlabeled lambda-phage DNA molecules was observed by fluorescence microscopy. One end of a 16- to 100-micrometer-long DNA was attached to a 1-micrometer bead and moved with optical tweezers. The molecule was stretched into various conformations having bends, kinks, and loops. As the polymer relaxed, it closely followed a path defined by its initial contour. The relaxation time of the disturbance caused by the bead was roughly 1 second, whereas tube-like motion in small loops persisted for longer than 2 minutes. Tube deformation, constraint release, and excess chain segment diffusion were also observed. These observations provide direct evidence for several key assumptions in the reptation model developed by de Gennes, Edwards, and Doi.

A ttosecond to femtosecond processes, quantum properties of atoms and photons, testing fundamental physics. Research in atomic, molecular, laser and X-ray physics at Stanford takes place in the Physics and Applied Physics Departments and in the Photon Science Department at National Accelerator Laboratory. A rich set of topics are explored in the Varian Physics Laboratory, the Ginzton Lab and through the PULSE Institute for Ultrafast Energy Science. SLAC houses both the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource and the Linac Coherent Light Source The structure and dynamics of matter at the atomic scale -- from Angstroms to nanometers in space and attoseconds to femtoseconds in time -- are studied using strong laser and x-ray fields to control and probe the quantum evolution of atoms and molecules. Basic questions in atomic physics are addressed through measurements of \"simple\" atoms, often laser-cooled and at the quantum-measurement level, leading to applications in real-world systems. Precision control of lasers and atoms are used for tests of space-time, advanced optical clocks, ultra-fast timing, atomic sensors, and ultra-sensitive detection of trace atoms.\u00a0 Quantum sensors of rotation and acceleration based on cold atoms (quantum metrology) are being developed for tests of general relativity, the investigation of many-body quantum effects in Bose-condensed vapors, and ultra-fast laser-induced phenomena. Other efforts aim to create and study novel quantum many-body systems, including quantum soft matter, using new techniques developed for creating and manipulating exotic dipolar ultracold atoms in optical lattices, near cryogenic surfaces, and inside multimode optical resonators.\u00a0 This research aims to elucidate the interplay between superfluidity, crystallinity, and magnetism to provide better intuition about the organizing principles of strongly interacting matter. Future efforts at Stanford will focus on the generation and detection of highly entangled many-body states of ultracold atoms, primarily using techniques of cavity QED, the exploration of quantum critical phenomena and routes to topological encoding of quantum information.
