                "We demonstrate the controlled and reversible telescopic extension of multiwall carbon nanotubes, thus realizing ultralow-friction nanoscale linear bearings and constant-force nanosprings. Measurements performed in situ on individual custom-engineered nanotubes inside a high-resolution transmission electron microscope demonstrated the anticipated van der Waals energy\u2013based retraction force and enabled us to place quantitative limits on the static and dynamic interwall frictional forces between nested nanotubes. Repeated extension and retraction of telescoping nanotube segments revealed no wear or fatigue on the atomic scale. Hence, these nanotubes may constitute near perfect, wear-free surfaces.",
                "Nanostructures are of great interest not only for their basic scientific richness, but also because they have the potential to revolutionize critical technologies. The miniaturization of electronic devices over the past century has profoundly affected human communication, computation, manufacturing and transportation systems. True molecular-scale electronic devices are now emerging that set the stage for future integrated nanoelectronics 1. Recently, there have been dramatic parallel advances in the miniaturization of mechanical and electromechanical devices 2. Commercial microelectromechanical systems now reach the submillimetre to micrometre size scale, and there is intense interest in the creation of next-generation synthetic nanometre-scale electromechanical systems 3, 4. We report on the construction and successful operation of a fully synthetic nanoscale electromechanical actuator incorporating a \u2026",
                "We have conducted pulling and bending tests on individual carbon nanotubes in-situ in a transition electron microscope. Based on our observation of the force required to break the tube, a tensile strength of 0.15 TPa was computed. From corresponding bending studies on such nanotubes, the Young's modulus was estimated to be 0.9 TPa (0.8 TPa after \u2018sub continuum\u2019 corrections). These results suggest a strength that is a large fraction of the elastic modulus, although previous measurements of their elastic stiffness have yielded higher modulus values, by as much as a factor of 2. The result does indicate that individual nanotubes can fail as essentially defect-free materials. Furthermore, we observed no obvious reduction in cross-sectional area prior to the failure. In addition, the bending experiments revealed a remarkable flexibility in these tubes. These unique properties support the potential of nanotubes as \u2026",
                "Graphite, as the most common anode for commercial Li-ion batteries, has been reported to have a very low capacity when used as a Na-ion battery anode. It is well known that electrochemical insertion of Na+ into graphite is significantly hindered by the insufficient interlayer spacing. Here we report expanded graphite as a Na-ion battery anode. Prepared through a process of oxidation and partial reduction on graphite, expanded graphite has an enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 4.3 \u00c5 yet retains an analogous long-range-ordered layered structure to graphite. In situ transmission electron microscopy has demonstrated that the Na-ion can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from expanded graphite. Galvanostatic studies show that expanded graphite can deliver a high reversible capacity of 284 mAh g\u2212 1 at a current density of 20 mA g\u2212 1, maintain a capacity of 184 mAh g\u2212 1 at 100 mA g\u2212 1, and retain 73.92 \u2026",
                "We report direct observation of an unexpected anisotropic swelling of Si nanowires during lithiation against either a solid electrolyte with a lithium counter-electrode or a liquid electrolyte with a LiCoO2 counter-electrode. Such anisotropic expansion is attributed to the interfacial processes of accommodating large volumetric strains at the lithiation reaction front that depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation. This anisotropic swelling results in lithiated Si nanowires with a remarkable dumbbell-shaped cross section, which develops due to plastic flow and an ensuing necking instability that is induced by the tensile hoop stress buildup in the lithiated shell. The plasticity-driven morphological instabilities often lead to fracture in lithiated nanowires, now captured in video. These results provide important insight into the battery degradation mechanisms.",
                "We have created insulated C60 nanowire by packing C60 molecules into the interior of insulating boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs).For small-diameter BNNTs, the wire consists of a linear chain of C60 molecules.With increasing BNNT inner diameter, unusual C60 stacking configurations are obtained (including helical, hollow core, and incommensurate) that are unknown for bulk or thin-film forms of C60.C60 in BNNTs thus presents a model system for studying the properties of dimensionally constrained \u201csilo\u201d crystal structures. For the linear-chain case, we have fused the C60 molecules to form a single-walled carbon nanotube inside the insulating BNNT.",
                "Renewable and clean \u201cgreen\u201d electronics based on paper substrates is an emerging field with intensifying research and commercial interests, as the technology combines the unique properties of flexibility, cost efficiency, recyclability, and renewability with the lightweight nature of paper. Because of its excellent optical transmittance and low surface roughness, nanopaper can host many types of electronics that are not possible on regular paper. However, there can be tremendous challenges with integrating devices on nanopaper due to its shape stability during processing. Here we demonstrate for the first time that flexible organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with high transparency can be fabricated on tailored nanopapers. Useful electrical characteristics and an excellent mechanical flexibility were observed. It is believed that the large binding energy between polymer dielectric and cellulose nanopaper, and the \u2026",
                "Various techniques including plasma-arc, laser ablation, and chemical vapor-phase synthesis have been employed to produce bulk amounts of non-carbon (such as boron nitride, BN) nanotubes with some success, but in general the yields are low. We describe a new high-yield plasma-arc method that easily and reliably produces macroscopic amounts of pure BN nanotubes. Interestingly, the method produces almost exclusively double-walled nanotubes; these in turn self-assemble into BN nanotube bundles or ropes. Our synthesis method also produces BN-coated crystalline nanoparticles, whose cores can be preferentially etched leaving behind hollow BN `nanococoons'.",
                "Recently, significant interest has emerged in fabricated systems that mimic the behavior of geometrically frustrated materials. We present the full realization of such an artificial spin ice system on a two-dimensional kagome lattice and we demonstrate rigid adherence to the local ice rule by directly counting individual pseudospins. The resulting spin configurations show not only local ice rules and long-range disorder, but also correlations consistent with spin ice Monte Carlo calculations. Our results suggest that dipolar corrections are significant in this system, as in pyrochlore spin ice, and that they open a door to further studies of frustration in general.",
                "A simplified arc-method is presented which allows for the continuous synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. In its basic form, the method requires only a dc power supply, a graphite electrode, and a container of liquid nitrogen with no need for pumps, seals, water-cooled vacuum chambers, or purge-gas handling systems. High-quality nanotubes are produced in high yield. The system is easily adaptable to produce large quantities of nanotubes continuously without interruptions for electrode replacement, chamber cleaning, or gas purging."
