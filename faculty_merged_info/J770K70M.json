                "Spiritual care has taken an important role in the aftermath of 9\/11. The shattering of numerous basic assumptions by this attack has created many spiritual and existential questions. In this article, we explore different aspects of spiritual care after major disasters and the different roles that clergy can fulfill. As the field of spiritual trauma care is in a rudimentary stage, best practices for spiritual care need to be developed. In the second part of the article, different elements of the training for spiritual caregivers are described. In order to assure appropriate caregiving, guidelines for training of clergy need to be developed."
