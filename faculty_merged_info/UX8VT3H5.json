                "Michel Foucault has become famous for a series of books that have permanently altered our understanding of many institutions of Western society. He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable Madness and Civilization; hospitals in The Birth of the Clinic; prisons in Discipline and Punish; and schools and families in The History of Sexuality. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them. Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent--and terrifying--portrait of society that he was patiently compiling. For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power\" reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives\" Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time--and, as this book proves \u2026",

                "We undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful AD GWAS to date. In stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (most significant SNP, rs2075650, P= 1.8\u00d7 10\u2212 157) and observed genome-wide significant association with SNPs at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the CLU (also known as APOJ) gene (rs11136000, P= 1.4\u00d7 10\u2212 9) and 5\u2032 to the PICALM gene (rs3851179, P= 1.9\u00d7 10\u2212 8). These associations were replicated in stage 2 (2,023 cases and 2,340 controls), producing compelling evidence for association with Alzheimer's disease in the combined dataset (rs11136000, P= 8.5\u00d7 10\u2212 10, odds ratio= 0.86; rs3851179, P= 1.3\u00d7 10\u2212 9, odds ratio= 0.86).",

                "The earlier studies aimed at investigating the response of tissue fatty acyl composition to variation in dietary fat were predominantly concerned with the state of essential fatty acid deficiency [91-95] and its correction. In dietary studies a fat-free diet or a diet containing only saturated fatty acids is often still used as one extreme point of reference. Later, interest developed in the effect of feeding levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids much in excess of the minimum dietary requirement for health, partly due to suggestions that this could have a beneficial prophylactic effect against heart disease [98]. More recently a growing interest in n-3 fatty acids [99], again partly prompted by suggestions that these could be beneficial in protecting against heart disease [100,101], has led to investigations of the response of tissues to the long chain n-3 fatty acids found most plentifully in marine animals.

We tested these variants for association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage 3).

                "A model is proposed for integrating the neural and cognitive aspects of the positive symptoms of acute schizophrenia, using evidence from postmortem neuropathology and neurochemistry, clinical and preclinical studies of dopaminergic neurotransmission, anatomical connections between the limbic system and basal ganglia, attentional and other cognitive abnormalities underlying the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, specific animal models of some of these abnormalities, and previous attempts to model the cognitive functions of the septohippocampal system and the motor functions of the basal ganglia. Anatomically, the model emphasises the projections from the septohippocampal system, via the subiculum, and the amygdala to nucleus accumbens, and their interaction with the ascending dopaminergic projection to the accumbens. Psychologically, the model emphasises a failure in acute schizophrenia to integrate stored memories of past regularities of perceptual input with ongoing motor programs in the control of current perception. A number of recent experiments that offer support for the model are briefly described, including anatomical studies of limbic-striatal connections, studies in the rat of the effects of damage to these connections, and of the effects of amphetamine and neuroleptics, on the partial reinforcement extinction effect, latent inhibition and the Kamin blocking effect; and studies of the latter two phenomena in acute and chronic schizophrenics.",
                " Background: Measurement of plasma total homocysteine has become common as new methods have been introduced. A wide range of disorders are associated with increased concentrations of total homocysteine. The purpose of this review is to provide an international expert opinion on the practical aspects of total homocysteine determinations in clinical practice and in the research setting and on the relevance of total homocysteine measurements as diagnostic or screening tests in several target populations. Methods: Published data available on Medline were used as the basis for the recommendations. Drafts of the recommendations were critically discussed at meetings over a period of 3 years. Outcome: This review is divided into two sections: (a) determination of homocysteine (methods and their performance, sample collection and handling, biological determinants, reference \u2026",
                "The study of synaptic connections in the electron microscope has established an \u2018elementary\u2019 circuit for the neostriatum which consists of a pathway from cortical areas (neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala) to medium spiny neurones of the striatum that also receive converging synaptic input from midbrain dopamine neurones. The striatal medium spiny neurones are projection neurones and they form synaptic contacts with output neurones in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticulata. In this way, dopaminergic afferents can directly modulate the flow of information from cortical areas through the striatum to the \u2018premotor\u2019 areas of the brainstem and to the thalamus. It is proposed that certain parts of the striatum can themselves control the activity of midbrain dopamine neurones and so one part of the striatum can \u2018gate\u2019 the flow of information through another part."
