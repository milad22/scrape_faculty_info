                " Wind\u2010borne pesticides have long been suggested as a cause of amphibian declines in areas without obvious habitat destruction. In California, the transport and deposition of pesticides from the agriculturally intensive Central Valley to the adjacent Sierra Nevada is well documented, and pesticides have been found in the bodies of Sierra frogs. Pesticides are therefore a plausible cause of declines, but to date no direct links have been found between pesticides and actual amphibian population declines. Using a geographic information system, we constructed maps of the spatial pattern of declines for eight declining California amphibian taxa, and compared the observed patterns of decline to those predicted by hypotheses of wind\u2010borne pesticides, habitat destruction, ultraviolet radiation, and climate change. In four species, we found a strong positive association between declines and the amount of upwind \u2026",
                "Declines in amphibian populations are rarely reported on the community or ecosystem level. We combined broad\u2010scale field sampling with historical analyses of museum records to quantify amphibian declines in California\u2019s Great Central Valley. Overall, amphibians showed an unambiguous pattern of decline, although the intensity of decline varied both geographically and taxonomically. The greatest geographical decline was detected in the counties of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. Two species, Rana aurora and Bufo boreas were identified as the most affected by decline, whereas Pseudacris regilla was the least affected. The Coast Range counties had little or no detectable decline. We provide new evidence implicating introduced predators as a primary threat. Introduced predators occur at lower elevations than native species, and our data indicate that for some native species there has been \u2026",
                "We present phylogenetic analyses of both molecular and morphological data for the 23 major lineages of living turtles and seven key fossil taxa. Nearly 1 kilobase of cytochrome b sequence, 325 base pairs of 12S ribosomal DNA, and 115 morphological characters contained similar phylogenetic information, although each provided unique information on different nodes of chelonian history. A character-based combinability test (implemented in PAUP*) and a nonparametric test of taxonomic congruence indicated no strong evidence for heterogeneity among data sets, and we used a combined approach to estimate a final phylogeny of the major lineages of living turtles. This approach resulted in a very well-resolved tree, with only a few of the deep branches within the Cryptodira left as an unresolved polytomy. The addition of six relatively complete fossils chosen to help resolve this basal polytomy provided little \u2026",
                "Efforts to document the decline of extant populations require a historical record of previous occurrences. Natural history museums contain such information for most regions of the world, at least at a coarse spatial scale. Museum collections have been successfully used to analyse declines in a wide range of plants and animals, at spatial scales ranging from single localities to large biotic and political regions. Natural history museum collections, when properly analysed, can be an invaluable tool in documenting changes in biodiversity during the past century.",
                "The human genome project has been recently complemented by whole-genome assessment sequence of 32 mammals and 24 nonmammalian vertebrate species suitable for comparative genomic analyses. Here we anticipate a precipitous drop in costs and increase in sequencing efficiency, with concomitant development of improved annotation technology and, therefore, propose to create a collection of tissue and DNA specimens for 10\u2009000 vertebrate species specifically designated for whole-genome sequencing in the very near future. For this purpose, we, the Genome 10K Community of Scientists (G10KCOS), will assemble and allocate a biospecimen collection of some 16\u2009203 representative vertebrate species spanning evolutionary diversity across living mammals, birds, nonavian reptiles, amphibians, and fishes (ca. 60\u2009000 living species).

                "The federally threatened California red\u2010legged frog (Rana aurora draytonii) has disappeared from much of its range for unknown reasons. We mapped 237 historic locations for the species and determined their current population status. Using a geographic information system (GIS), we determined latitude, elevation, and land use attributes for all sites and analyzed the spatial pattern of declines. We then compared the observed patterns of decline to those predicted by the climate change, UV\u2010B radiation, pesticides, and habitat alteration hypotheses for amphibian decline. Declines were not consistent with the climate change hypothesis but showed a strong positive association with elevation, percentage upwind agricultural land use, and local urbanization. These results apply to patterns of decline across the entire range of R. a. draytonii in California, as well as within geographic subregions. The elevational gradient \u2026",
                "The number, size, and scope of phylogenetic analyses using molecular data has increased steadily in recent years. This has simultaneously led to a dramatic improvement in our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and a better appreciation for an array of methodological problems that continue to hinder progress in phylogenetic studies of certain data sets and\/or particular parts of the tree of life. This review focuses on several persistent problems, including rooting, conflict among data sets, weak support in trees, strong but evidently incorrect support, and the computational issues arising when methods are applied to the large data sets that are becoming increasingly commonplace. We frame each of these issues as a specific problem to be overcome, review the relevant theoretical and empirical literature, and suggest solutions, or at least strategies, for further investigation of the issues involved.",
                "We describe the genome of the western painted turtle, Chrysemys picta bellii, one of the most widespread, abundant, and well-studied turtles. We place the genome into a comparative evolutionary context, and focus on genomic features associated with tooth loss, immune function, longevity, sex differentiation and determination, and the species' physiological capacities to withstand extreme anoxia and tissue freezing. Our phylogenetic analyses confirm that turtles are the sister group to living archosaurs, and demonstrate an extraordinarily slow rate of sequence evolution in the painted turtle. The ability of the painted turtle to withstand complete anoxia and partial freezing appears to be associated with common vertebrate gene networks, and we identify candidate genes for future functional analyses. Tooth loss shares a common pattern of pseudogenization and degradation of tooth-specific genes with birds, although the rate of accumulation of mutations is much slower in the painted turtle. Genes associated with sex differentiation generally reflect phylogeny rather than convergence in sex determination functionality. Among gene families that demonstrate exceptional expansions or show signatures of strong natural selection, immune function and musculoskeletal patterning genes are consistently over-represented. Our comparative genomic analyses indicate that common vertebrate regulatory networks, some of which have analogs in human diseases, are often involved in the western painted turtle's extraordinary physiological capacities. As these regulatory pathways are analyzed at the functional level, the painted turtle may offer important \u2026",
                "The turtle family Geoemydidae represents the largest, most diverse, and most poorly understood family of turtles. Little is known about this group, including intrafamilial systematics. The only complete phylogenetic hypothesis for this family positions geoemydids as paraphyletic with respect to tortoises, but this arrangement has not been accepted by many workers. We compiled a 79-taxon mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data set to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships for 65 species and subspecies representing all 23 genera of the Geoemydidae. Maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses and Bayesian analysis produced similar, well-resolved trees. Our analyses identified three main clades comprising the tortoises (Testudinidae), the old-world Geoemydidae, and the South American geoemydid genus Rhinoclemmys. Within Geoemydidae, many nodes were strongly supported, particularly \u2026",
                "Although still controversial, estimation of divergence times using molecular data has emerged as a powerful tool to examine the tempo and mode of evolutionary change. Two primary obstacles in improving the accuracy of molecular dating are heterogeneity in DNA substitution rates and accuracy of the fossil record as calibration points. Recent methodological advances have provided powerful methods that estimate relative divergence times in the face of heterogeneity of nucleotide substitution rates among lineages. However, relatively little attention has focused on the accuracy of fossil calibration points that allow one to translate relative divergence times into absolute time. We present a new cross\u2010validation method that identifies inconsistent fossils when multiple fossil calibrations are available for a clade and apply our method to a molecular phylogeny of living turtles with fossil calibration times for 17 of the 22 \u2026"

Astronomy and Astrophysics A primary thrust of research is to use photometry of exploding objects to get results\n                  of interest for cosmology: For supernovae, as part of the Supernova Cosmology Project, a Hubble Diagram\n                  was created with high accuracy out to a red shift of ~1.0. This demonstrated that the Cosmological Constant is non-zero and causes\n                  our Universe's expansion to accelerate. This is the discovery of what is now called\n                  'Dark Energy'. For this work, I was awarded a share of the $500,000 Gruber Prize for\n                  Cosmology in 2007, and awarded a share of the $3,000,000 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental\n                  Physics in 2015. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutter for\n                  his original work, inspiration, and leadership for the Supernova Cosmology Project. We have work that has been getting answers to the notorious and highly-important\n                  Type Ia supernova progenitor problem. For example, in a recent Nature paper with graduate\n                  student Ashley Pagnotta, the lack of any possible ex-companion star in the center\n                  of SNR 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud proves that this Type Ia supernova\n                  must have come from a double-degenerate progenitor. \u00a0For this one 400\u00b150 year old\n                  Type Ia explosion, it is very confident that all published single-degenerate models\n                  are greatly rejected, because any remaining ex-companion star must be less luminous\n                  than M V =+8.4.\u00a0 With graduate students Zachary Edwards and Ashley Pagnotta, less-strong limits\n                  have been applied to three other supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\u00a0\n                  In a further innovative study, with graduate student Zachary Edwards, we have measured\n                  the 'vertical' distribution of Type Ia and Core Collapse supernovae as viewed in exactly\n                  edge-on spiral galaxies. The Core Collapse supernovae are all closely concentrated\n                  to the galactic plane (although avoiding the exact plane due to the usual dust lanes),\n                  proving that their progenitors are a very young population. The Type Ia supernovae\n                  have a very large scale height, proving that their progenitors are a very old population,\n                  mostly older than ~2 billion years.\u00a0 This simple observation can be compared to the\n                  predictions for single-degenerate models giving an age distribution younger than a\n                  fraction of a billion years, and the predictions for a double-degenerate population\n                  giving an age distribution older than a billion years, with the strong conclusion\n                  that most Type Ia supernovae in spirals are from double-degenerate progenitors.\u00a0 With\n                  these two lines of evidence, we make a strong case that Type Ia supernovae are effectively\n                  all from double-degenerate progenitors (i.e., from the in-spiral of a close-in white-dwarf-plus-white-dwarf\n                  binary). For Recurrent Novae, the question is whether they are the progenitors\n                  of Type Ia supernovae, as the knowledge of the progenitor type is required for any\n                  evolution calculation such as is needed for the future precision cosmology with supernovae.\n                  To answer the progenitor question, extensive work is being pursued to get Recurrent\n                  Novae orbital periods, accretion rates, outburst dates, eruption light curves, and\n                  the average magnitudes between outbursts. A centerpiece of this work is the timing\n                  of eclipses from four systems (U Sco, T Pyx, T CrB, and CI Aql) since 1855 to measure\n                  the orbital period changes across the latest eruptions (in 2010, 2011, 1946, and 2000\n                  respectively) so as to get the first measures of the ejected mass, with the result\n                  in all four cases that the white dwarfs are ejecting much more mass than they had\n                  accreted in the previous cycle, so the white dwarfs are losing mass and recurrent\n                  novae are not supernova progenitors. The eruption of U Sco was predicted and occurred\n                  in 2010, with a large international collaboration (collecting data from 8 satellites\n                  and 30 telescopes) making this eruption the all-time best observed nova event. In\n                  2011, the eruption of T Pyx was observed with ~100,000 magnitudes in the light curve.\n                  \u00a0Further killer arguments against recurrent novae as supernova progenitors include\n                  the fact that most of the nova eruptions are very neon rich, and that the many close\n                  searches by many other researchers have always severely excluded the possibility of\n                  any red giant or sub-giant companion star.\u00a0 From these three convincing paths, we\n                  can be sure that recurrent novae (i.e., the most popular single-degenerate path to\n                  Type Ia supernova) certainly can contribute less than ~1% of all observed events.\u00a0\n                  That is, recurrent novae are not progenitors. For Gamma-Ray Bursts, the big advance has been the realization that the\n                  bursts are standard candles (like Type Ia Supernovae and Cepheids). With this, GRBs\n                  become tools for cosmology that can be seen out to red shifts from ~0.2 to around >8. This allows GRBs\n                  to be used to create a Hubble Diagram from 0.2<z<7, and this can independently prove\n                  that \u03a9 M =0.39 (+0.12, -0.08) from the GRBs alone.\u00a0 Well, by the time I could make this independent\n                  derivation, the Supernova Cosmology Project, the cosmic microwave background work,\n                  and the galaxy's baryonic acoustic oscillations work had already demonstrated the\n                  existence of something like what we call the Cosmological Constant, so this GRB result\n                  serves merely as independent confirmation. \u00a0\u00a0But GRBs go out to greatly higher redshifts\n                  than do supernovae, so GRBs uniquely have the ability to record the changing equation\n                  of state of the Universe.\u00a0 As an example of this, my GRB Hubble Diagram conclusively\n                  rules out the models for 'Weyl gravity' and for a 'Chaplygin gas' equation of state.\u00a0\n                  What I am finding is that the GRB Hubble Diagram is consistent with the concordance\n                  model and also with an unchanging Cosmological Constant. History of Astronomy For my work in the history of astronomy, I have often served as a technical calculator\n                  of celestial visibility and its myriad applications to old history: One set of analyses relates to the visibility of the stars\/planets\/Moon\n                  low in the sky, often during evening twilight or the dawn sky.\u00a0 This is actually a\n                  complex problem needing fundamental physics input for the scattering and refraction\n                  of light in the atmosphere and the probability of detection by human eyes for a source\n                  viewed against a smooth background.\u00a0 In all cases, my style is always to collect large\n                  amounts of ground-truth data and compare it against my new best theory.\u00a0 The simplest\n                  case is just for knowing the altitude above the horizon (called the extinction angle)\n                  at which a rising star first becomes visible.\u00a0 With the results from this study, I\n                  could easily refute an influential set of claims for archaeoastronomical alignments\n                  (the megalithic lunar observatory claims by Thom) and refute several claims for how\n                  the Great Pyramid was aligned.\u00a0 The next harder case is that of 'heliacal rising',\n                  which is a star's first visibility on one day as it comes out from behind the Sun.\u00a0\n                  Many ancient calendars are based on the heliacal rising of stars. My observations\n                  reported in the paper are the first observations published since c. 300 BC, and my\n                  theory is the first advance since 150 AD.\u00a0 My great leaps forward are simply because\n                  I am the first astrophysicist who has addressed these antique questions with the full\n                  tools of modern science.\u00a0 Applications of my heliacal rise model include for the Star\n                  of Bethlehem, the Egyptian Sothic cycle, and the peak magnitudes of ancient supernovae.\u00a0\n                  The next step up is to determine the visibility of the thin crescent Moon, low in\n                  the western sky soon after sunset.\u00a0 This visibility defines the first day of the lunar\n                  month in most lunar and luni-solar calendars, and this is applicable to most cultures\n                  worldwide.\u00a0 I have spent about one man-year on this problem.\u00a0 Part of this is collecting\n                  large numbers of positive and negative sightings of the young crescent Moon.\u00a0 From\n                  this effort, I have a complex algorithm that predicts the date of first visibility\n                  for each lunar month for any site in the world for any year from 600 BC to far into\n                  the future.\u00a0 This explicitly accounts for the variations over time of the haziness\n                  of the atmosphere (the extinction coefficient).\u00a0 A comparison of my model versus the\n                  full data collection shows that my model is 3X better than any prior model or criterion.\u00a0\n                  Again, this is not surprising, simply because I am the first astrophysicist to treat\n                  the entire problem as a physics and astronomy task with modern methods.\u00a0 My modern\n                  visibility algorithm has a strong application in dating the Crucifixion. A frequently-used tool is 'precessional dating', where ancient reports\n                  on the positions of stars can be translated into both a year and a latitude for whoever\n                  made those observations.\u00a0 What is going on is that precession very slowly moves the\n                  stars around the sky (relative to the equinoxes), so that the stars form something\n                  like a giant clock, where each star operates as an hour-hand extending from the north\n                  pole reading out the time.\u00a0 The ancient observers are merely telling us the position\n                  of the stars, so we can work out the reported time.\u00a0 With the many sizeable data sets,\n                  the year can be determined to within a long-lifetime and the latitude can be determined\n                  to within ~50 miles.\u00a0 Here are my results: \u00a0(1) The origin of the Chinese lunar lodge\n                  system (the hsiu) was in the year 3200\u00b1500 BC.\u00a0 (2) The origin of the Indian lunar\n                  lodge system (the nakshatra) was in the year 1700\u00b1500 BC. \u00a0(3) The origin of the Arabic\n                  lunar lodge system (the manazil) was in 200\u00b1400 BC. \u00a0(4) The origin of the 'Imperial'\n                  Chinese constellations, those described in the 'anciently' list of the Kai Yuan Zhan\n                  Jing, is 300\u00b1200 BC. \u00a0(5) The star lore in the much-copied Babylonian tablet series\n                  called MUL.APIN dates back to 1370\u00b1100 BC with a latitude of 35.1\u00b0\u00b11.2\u00b0, which is\n                  to say that the Mesopotamian constellation lore goes back to the time and place of\n                  the Assyrian cultural flowering, just when the archaeologists are returning the first\n                  evidence of their constellations.\u00a0 (6) The southern Greek constellations were invented\n                  in the year 690\u00b1360 BC from a latitude of 33\u00b0\u00b12\u00b0, which is to say that they originally\n                  came from Mesopotamia.\u00a0 (7) The astronomical observations reported in Eudoxus' best-selling\n                  book The Phaenomena date back to 1130\u00b180 BC, with a latitude of 36.0\u00b0\u00b10.9\u00b0, which\n                  is to say that Eudoxus was merely repeating work passed down to him over 800 years\n                  from some observer in Mesopotamia. (8) Hipparchus' only surviving book is a lesser\n                  work called The Commentary, which describes many star positions, presumably from his\n                  famous star catalog.\u00a0 From detailed analysis of all his reported constraints, I derive\n                  an epoch of 136\u00b18 BC, a latitude of 36.31\u00b0\u00b10.23\u00b0, an adopted obliquity of 23.8\u00b0\u00b10.2\u00b0,\n                  and a total 1-sigma error bar of 1\/3\u00b0 for individual reported star positions.\u00a0 (9)\n                  The marble statue called the \"Farnese Atlas\" in Naples depicts the full set of Greek\n                  constellations, with the positions for the stars in 125\u00b155 BC, with the only realistic\n                  candidate for the source of the positions is the great astronomer Hipparchus, who\n                  famously has a star catalog from that time.\u00a0 (10) In Ptolemy's Almagest, the southern\n                  stars inside the first three quadrants date to an epoch of 500\u00b1200 AD and a latitude\n                  of 32.0\u00b0\u00b10.8\u00b0, and were certainly from Ptolemy (c. 150 BC) himself in Alexandria (31.2\u00b0\n                  north).\u00a0 The southern stars inside the fourth quadrant have an epoch of 600\u00b1500 BC\n                  and a latitude of 35.7\u00b0\u00b11.1\u00b0 and apparently were selected and positioned by Hipparchus\n                  (c. 130 BC) in Rhodes (36.4\u00b0 north). I have a wide variety of overview articles on many topics (not related\n                  to celestial visibility).\u00a0 I am most proud of a long series of 19 feature articles\n                  in the magazine Sky & Telescope with the common theme of showing how astronomical\n                  events in the sky relate to real people on the ground, both famous figures and common\n                  folk.\u00a0 For the big international quadrennial Oxford Conference series (Oxford VII)\n                  in June 2004, I presented the Keynote address titled \"Case Studies of Three of the\n                  Most Famous Claimed Asrchaeoastronomical Alignments in North America\", where I was\n                  chastising many in the archaeoastronomy community for poor methodology, and emphasizing\n                  the need to present evidence that proves the intention by the original builders of\n                  any claimed alignment. I have a distinctive style of combining history and astrophysics, where\n                  I use old or very-old data to critically answer modern front-line science questions.\u00a0\n                  For example, I have used Tycho Brahe's original astrometric measures of the position\n                  of the 1572 supernova to solve the long-running big-time controversy as to whether\n                  the so-called 'Star G' is the ex-companion star of the exploding system, with my answer\n                  being 'no', thus breaking one of the few good arguments for the single-degenerate\n                  progenitor model.\u00a0 I have used detailed and exhaustive textual analysis of the ancient\n                  Chinese records of a transient event from 186 AD to prove that this was not a supernova,\n                  but rather was the known appearance of a periodic comet.\u00a0 I have used the photometric\n                  reports plus the heliacal rise\/set dates (with my modern algorithm) to derive the\n                  peak magnitudes of the Type Ia supernovae of the years 1006, 1572, and 1604 to get\n                  peak magnitudes and then a value for the Hubble Constant.\u00a0 In an now-nearly-unique\n                  methodology, I have recovered vast amounts of data from dusty archives to collect\n                  light curves of recurrent novae, going far back in time.\u00a0 The most extreme example,\n                  is for the canonical recurrent nova T CrB, I have recovered >100,000 magnitudes from\n                  1829 to present in both B and V colors, measuring the unique and weird pre-eruptions\n                  and post-eruption events that are identical across the 1866 and 1946 eruptions.\u00a0 Part\n                  of this means that I am predicting a third eruption in the year 2022.\u00a0 Most critically,\n                  I have measured the orbital period change across the eruption, with this requiring\n                  a tremendous amount of mass ejection, such that T CrB cannot become a Type Ia supernova.\u00a0\n                  A frequently-used data source is the Harvard collection of archival sky photographs\n                  going back to 1889, where for many stars I can recover 1000-3000 magnitudes spread\n                  over 1889-1953 plus 1969-1989, so as to provide a near-unique record of the star's\n                  history.\u00a0 For a recent example, I have looked at the very-mysterious star KIC 8462852\n                  (also called Boyajian's star after the LSU professor Tabetha Boyajian) to find that\n                  it is fading by ~19% from the early 1890s to the late 1980s.\u00a0 This provides a proof\n                  that the weird behavior of the star is not due to comet swarms, alien-mega-structures,\n                  or any of various other proposed ideas.
