The length of those\u00a0nanostructures\n                  extends to centimeter range and diameter around lower tens of nanometer.\u00a0Characterization\n                  of their various properties makes those nanomaterials promising\u00a0applications in versatile\n                  sensing and solar energy systems. I am also interested in\u00a0studying electronic structure,\n                  magnetic and optical properties of solid bulk, thin film, and\u00a0low dimensional nanomaterials\n                  by using a standard software package (wien2k). It is\u00a0based on a standard computational\n                  technique of density functional theory. In addition, I\u00a0am interested in educational\n                  and pedagogical research in STEM disciplines. Old-fashioned teacher-center activities\n                  in classroom are gradually out-of-date. Recently I am\u00a0working on intro-level course\n                  redesign to switch classroom activities from traditional\u00a0lecturing to instructor active\n                  teaching and student active learning manner. The goals of\u00a0such changes are to improve\n                  student learning and success, and retention in STEM\u00a0disciplines. 1. \"Electronic and optical properties of mixed Be-chalcogenides,\" I.
