(K.T. Bainbridge)Award 1988 Keasbey Foundation Fellowship, 1986-87 My work focuses on the lightest known matter particles, the neutrino. Their number far exceeds the atoms in the universe. Yet we know surprisingly little about these particles. It is only recently, for example, that we came to realize these particles have mass, albeit very tiny. This became clear when neutrinos were shown to live a double life, transforming from one type into another through the quantum mechanical effect of neutrino oscillations. This effect requires neutrino mass. Neutrino mass is the first \"chink\" in the surprisingly resilient theory of particle physics called The Standard Model. The purpose of my research is to exploit this opportunity through further study of neutrinos. Now that we know that neutrinos have surprising new properties, I am involved in tests to see if they have more unexpected \"features\". My studies using neutrinos as probes for new physics involve the BooNE experiments. The first generation of these experiments was the MiniBooNE experiment , which searched for a new neutrino beyond the three types known in the Standard Model. This was motivated by an oscillation result from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) experiment at Los Alamos, which indicated an oscillation wavelength inconsistent with other experiments, perhaps pointing to the existence of a new neutrino species, called the sterile neutrino. MiniBooNE detected an excess of events above the Standard Model expectation. However, crucial differences between this result and the sterile neutrino prediction based on LSND, has led us to build an even more sensitive detector, MicroBooNE, which is a state-of-the-art liquid Argon time projection chamber. The MicroBooNE detector, and its partner experiment, SBND, will have bubble-chamber-like resolution of particle tracks that now runs at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory . At the same time, I am also involved in exploring the questions raised by LSND and MiniBooNE on the IceCube Experiment . This experiment, located at the South Pole, deep in the Antarctic ice, detects astrophysical neutrinos. It was originally constructed as a neutrino telescope. However, at this point, it is also a beautiful detector for particle physics. We are deeply involved in a sterile neutrino search using the IceCube data in the 700 GeV to 20 TeV range as well as other Beyond Standard Model searches.\u00a0 Soon the IceCube detector will be upgraded with additional detectors in the central region. We are actively participating in this upgrade, which will open more opportunities to search for new physics. In the farther future, neutrino physics will need better neutrino sources in order to pursue precision studies of neutrino properties. To this end, my group also works on developing high power cyclotrons to drive decay-at-rest neutrino sources. Our projects in this area are called IsoDAR and DAE\u03b4ALUS .
