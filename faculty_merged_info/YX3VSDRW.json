This radiation is a relic remnant from the big bang. Detailed characterization of the properties of the CMB can give tremendous amount of information about the evolution of the universe. By 'evolution of the universe' we mean: from immediately after the bang until galaxies and clusters of galaxies formed. Already our research has claimed national recognition: Science Magazine has labeled results that we published in 2000 as \"one of the 10 most important breakthroughs in science for the year 2000\". The instruments we build are launched on balloon borne platforms to altitudes above 100,000 ft. They use the highest sensitivity detectors in the world, as well as many other innovations that you won't find in Home Depot, Menards or Ax-Man. The balloon flight usually lasts between a few hours to few weeks. Some members of our group specialize in the analysis and interpretation of data and its implication for cosmology. Those members use the facilities of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Visit the Hanany Group Supercomputing Institute website to learn more.
