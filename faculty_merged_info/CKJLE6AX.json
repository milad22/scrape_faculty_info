For 2905 field galaxies, complete to   at  , with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to  , we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 \u03bcm photometry, optical\u2010NIR   measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct \u201cmain sequence\u201d (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given   and z (  dex), and   approximately proportional to  . The range of   remains constant to  , while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend \u223c67%(95%) of their lifetime since   within a factor of \u22722(4) of their average SFR at a given   and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of \u2026"
