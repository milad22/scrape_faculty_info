                "The term collaboration is widely used but not clearly understood or operationalized. However, collaboration is playing an increasingly important role between and across public, nonprofit, and for-profit sectors. Collaboration has become a hallmark in both intragovernmental and intergovernmental relationships. As collaboration scholarship rapidly emerges, it diverges into several directions, resulting in confusion about what collaboration is and what it can be used to accomplish. This book provides much needed insight into existing ideas and theories of collaboration, advancing a revised theoretical model and accompanying typologies that further our understanding of collaborative processes within the public sector. Organized into three parts, each chapter presents a different theoretical approach to public problems, valuing the collective insights that result from honoring many individual perspectives. Case studies in collaboration, split across three levels of government, offer additional perspectives on unanswered questions in the literature. Contributions are made by authors from a variety of backgrounds, including an attorney, a career educator, a federal executive, a human resource administrator, a police officer, a self-employed entrepreneur, as well as scholars of public administration and public policy. Drawing upon the individual experiences offered by these perspectives, the book emphasizes the commonalities of collaboration. It is from this common ground, the shared experiences forged among seemingly disparate interactions that advances in collaboration theory arise. Advancing Collaboration Theory offers a unique compilation of \u2026",
                "Much attention has recently been paid to comparative work in the public and private sectors looking at work values, motivations, and the impact of government reform movements in organizations. Several studies have compared the public and private sectors in the dimension of values; but none have questioned the popular assumption that nonprofit and public managers share the same or a similar set of values or the value expectations they have for each other. This paper reports on the results of an empirical survey of public and nonprofit managers that compares their individual democratic, ethical, and professional values. In brief, the results lend strong support to the assumption that nonprofit employees share the same value set as their public sector counterparts; but their value sets do have statistically significant differences in the perceived level of importance of altruism, generosity, and individualism.",
                "As the world has become increasingly connected over the last few decades, government and public managers have had to adapt from traditional unitary, hierarchical organizations to networked, collaborative, multiorganizational arrangements (O\u2019Leary & Vij, 2012). This changing environment and the continued growth of third-party governance have led to an abundance of collaborative public management scholarship (O\u2019Leary & Vij, 2012; Thomson, Perry, & Miller, 2009). Much of this literature is by its nature multidisciplinary, vast, and highly fragmented. While the varying conceptualizations add perspective and depth to the field, this richness also makes it difficult to compare results and communicate across disciplines (Thomson et al., 2009).What this variation produces is not a simple agreed upon definition of the study of collaboration, but an array of wide-ranging theoretical perspectives, definitions, and understandings of collaborative public management (Thomson et al., 2009). Disagreements abound, from process and structure, to distinctions of organizational relationships, all of which have only served to add to the confusion and ambiguity shrouding the field (Morse & Stephens, 2012). To move forward and to build a common language across the multidisciplinary field of study, it is imperative that we heed the advice of prior work in an effort to identify and discuss the core values comprising interorganizational collaboration. This will allow us not only to better understand collaborative elements and processes, but also to gain additional insight into the critical components that help collaboratives to successfully achieve their program goals.",
                "As the paradigm shift from command-and-control statutes to collaborative partnerships increases, public administrators, policy makers, and watershed stakeholders will become more dependent on collaborative partnerships to solve complex environmental problems. This article explores watershed management partnerships and suggests a new typology of collaboration built on the variable of governance. The typology categorizes three types of watershed partnerships as interagency governance, cross-sector governance, and grassroots governance. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of watershed partnerships through the lens of governance structure will enhance public administrator and policy makers\u2019 abilities to provide the best approach for addressing a particular watershed goal.",
                "The advocacy coalition framework (ACF) provides a means to explore complex policy issues and the dynamics of belief systems shared by multiple actors in the policy\u2010making process. Using a single case study, this article expands the application of the ACF to the complex policy subsystem of the U.S. automobile industry during the 2009 auto bailout and subsequent bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler. We examine the development and actions of policy coalitions and further expand the ACF by exploring the role of policy brokers during the automobile crisis. We also examine whether policy brokers are politically neutral actors as previous research debates and what actions they take if compromise cannot be reached between competing coalitions.

                "Many MPA programs are struggling to identify ways to evaluate their outcomes. This paper describes the development and implementation of a method for assessing student learning outcomes in the MPA program at the University of Colorado Denver. The multi-method approach makes use of rubrics to examine whether students demonstrate the desired knowledge and skill, and student surveys to describe students\u2019 perceptions of their abilities in the same areas. Means for gaining faculty commitment to the process and making use of the information for program improvement are discussed.",
                "Building on previous models of collaboration processes, this article expands and revises the antecedent-process-outcome framework used to explain collaboration. The article discusses why this framework needs to be expanded to include the element of institutional structure. We propose a modified framework to explain collaboration that includes a typology of citizen-based, agency-based, and mixed partnerships. Furthermore, the article draws from the expansive body of literature on watershed collaboration to propose additional antecedents that influence institutional structures and, in turn, alter the process patterns in the collaboration \u201cblack box.\u201d",
                "This study considers key value differences between leaders of two types of social ventures: for-profit social benefit corporations and nonprofit organizations. The research question asks to what degree the value sets of leaders of benefit corporations are congruent with those of similarly situated individuals in nonprofit organizations. The results show the values of leaders working in benefit corporations and nonprofit organizations are in many ways aligned, but there are notable statistical differences. A sectoral association of values is also present with employees in both types of organization, especially when the previous work experience of employees is considered.",
                "This study examines partnerships between the military and local communities by exploring communication channels of the U.S. military and civilian agencies that provide services to transitioning military members. This article reports on a study conducted in 2013 in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area, designed to determine the degree to which the military enters into partnerships with civilian service providers. We find that navy agencies in Hampton Roads do work with community partners, but the military is more directive than one might imagine in a true partnership, leading to \u201cuneasy\u201d partnerships. Additionally, there are important structural and organizational barriers that prevent true partnerships from developing between navy agencies and the community providers.",
                "This exploratory study examines examines the utility of using public service motivation to explain individual motivations to participate on nonprofit boards of directors. High-ranking members of nonprofit organizations and boards of directors were convened in a roundtable discussion to explore the motives of their board members. Using the rational, normative, and affective bases of motivation, it was reported that affective motives appear to be an important driver for individuals joining nonprofit boards, while both rational and affective motives are important in the decision to continue to serve. It was also suggested that a service ethos early in life is an important antecedent in both the attraction and retention of most board members. The findings will help nonprofit administrators and boards better understand the underlying motivational constructs of board members, thus resulting in improved board governance practices \u2026"
