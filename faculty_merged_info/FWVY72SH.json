                "The spectrum of known black-hole solutions to the stationary Einstein equations has been steadily increasing, sometimes in unexpected ways. In particular, it has turned out that not all black-hole-equilibrium configurations are characterized by their mass, angular momentum and global charges. Moreover, the high degree of symmetry displayed by vacuum and electro-vacuum black-hole spacetimes ceases to exist in self-gravitating non-linear field theories. This text aims to review some developments in the subject and to discuss them in light of the uniqueness theorem for the Einstein-Maxwell system.",

When the \u201cboundary at infinity\" has spherical topology one single invariant is obtained, called the mass; we show positivity thereof. We apply the definition to conformally compactifiable manifolds, and show that the mass is completion-independent. We also prove the result, closely related to the problem at hand, that conformal completions of conformally compactifiable manifolds are unique.",

                "Generalizing an analysis of Corvino and Schoen, we study surjectivity properties of the constraint map in general relativity in a large class of weighted function spaces. As a corollary we prove several perturbation, gluing, and extension results: we show existence of non-trivial, singularity-free, vacuum space-times which are stationary in a neighborhood of i0; for small perturbations of parity-covariant initial data sufficiently close to those for Minkowski space-time this leads to space-times with a smooth global I; we prove existence of initial data for many black holes which are exactly Kerr\u2014or exactly Schwarzschild\u2014both near infinity and near each of the connected components of the apparent horizon; under appropriate conditions we obtain existence of vacuum extensions of vacuum initial data across compact boundaries; we show that for generic metrics the deformations in the Isenberg-Mazzeo-Pollack gluings can be localized, so that the initial data on the connected sum manifold coincide with the original ones except for a small neighborhood of the gluing region; we prove existence of asymptotically flat solutions which are static or stationary up to r\u2212 m terms, for any fixed m, and with multipole moments freely prescribable within certain ranges. c M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France 94, SMF 2003",

We show that generic \u201chyperboloidal initial data\u201d display asymptotic behaviour which is not compatible with Penrose\u2019s hypothesis of smoothness of J (. We also show that a large class of \u201cnon\u2013generic\u201d initial data satisfying Penrose smoothness conditions exists.

Existence and properties of solutions of the constraint equations are analyzed. Some \u201ccanonical\u201d forms of the metric are derived.

                "The strong cosmic censorship conjecture says that'most'spacetimes developed as solutions of Einstein's equations from prescribed initial data cannot be extended outside of their domains of dependence. Here, the authors discuss results which show that if they restrict attention to the polarised Gowdy spacetimes, strong cosmic censorship holds. More specifically, these results show that in the space of Cauchy data for polarised Gowdy spacetimes, there is an open dense subset for which the maximal globally hyperbolic development is inextendible. Among the Gowdy spacetimes which can be extended, the authors find a set of them which admit a countable infinity of inequivalent classes of extensions. They also find that a polarised Gowdy spacetime (T 3 or S 2* S 1) may be extended as a solution of Einstein's equations (with the Gowdy isometries) across a compact Cauchy horizon only if it is analytic."
