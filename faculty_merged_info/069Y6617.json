                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "Flowering time is a complex trait that controls adaptation of plants to their local environment in the outcrossing species Zea mays (maize). We dissected variation for flowering time with a set of 5000 recombinant inbred lines (maize Nested Association Mapping population, NAM). Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis.",
                "We studied the evolution of 150 pregnancies corresponding to 114 women (16-39 years old) with primary hypothyroidism. Fifty-one pregnancies (34%) were conceived under hypothyroidism: 16 overt (X \u00b1          standard deviation [SD], thyroxine [T4]: 2.44 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg\/dL; thyrotropin [TSH]: 33.4 \u00b1 8.82 mIU\/L), and 35 subclinical hypothyroidism (T4: 6.93 \u00b1 1.88          \u03bcg\/dL; TSH: 12.87 \u00b1 8.43 mIU\/L); 99 pregnancies were conceived under euthyroidism while undergoing thyroid therapy. When treatment with levothyroxine was inadequate, the outcome of pregnancy          was abortion in 60% of overtly hypothyroid patients and in 71.4% of subclinically hypothyroid patients, premature delivery in 20% and 7.2% respectively, and term delivery in 20% and 21.4%, respectively.

                "Activation of calcium-ion (Ca 2+) channels on the plasma membrane and on intracellular Ca 2+ stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, generates local transient increases in the cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration that induce Ca 2+ uptake by neighbouring mitochondria. Here, by using mitochondrially targeted aequorin proteins with different Ca 2+ affinities, we show that half of the chromaffin-cell mitochondria exhibit surprisingly rapid millimolar Ca 2+ transients upon stimulation of cells with acetylcholine, caffeine or high concentrations of potassium ions. Our results show a tight functional coupling of voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels on the plasma membrane, ryanodine receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. Cell stimulation generates localized Ca 2+ transients, with Ca 2+ concentrations above 20\u201340 \u00b5M, at these functional units. Protonophores abolish mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake and \u2026",
                "This volume focuses on the topics in data collection, analysis, and use that were raised in its \ncompanion book, Project Monitoring and Evaluation in Agriculture. It summarizes these topics \nin the context set by the companion volume, which documented the importance of monitoring \nand recommended that ambitious evaluations be done only selectively. The book further explains \nthe data collection and analysis techniques referred to in the companion volume. It is \nselective; it does not provide comprehensive coverage of all methods. Furthermore, for those \nmethods it does cover, the book advocates simplicity and economy. It emphasizes qualitative \ninterviewing methods because most monitoring and evaluation efforts will need to use them for \nlimited, non-random coverage of respondents. Examples of sample theory and sample \nselection, conversely, are mainly in terms of rates of adoption and similar indicators. In a \u2026 ",
                "Within the present contribution we highlight the feasibility of standard refinery units for the production of biofuels from different biomass-derived feedstock. The energy densification of biomass, as well as it\u2019s logistics and incorporation within the refinery supply chain is thoroughly discussed. Likewise, special attention is focused on the catalytic cracking and hydrotreating of triglyceride-rich biomass feedstock, which is probably the most suitable one for co-processing in conventional refinery conversion units. However, the opportunities of other highly oxygenated feedstocks such as pyrolysis oils and sugars are also discussed. Conversion of different feedstocks into conventional liquid fuels by coupling of aqueous phase reforming (APR) with catalytic systems typical of standard petroleum refineries is also evaluated. Thus, here we review the chemistry, catalysis and challenges involved in the production of biofuels from \u2026",
                "With 27 million cases worldwide documented in 2006, Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes an overwhelming health, social, economic, and political problem to nations. Unless a new medicine capable to delay disease progression is found, the number of cases will reach 107 million in 2050. So far, the therapeutic paradigm one\u2010compound\u2010one\u2010target has failed. This could be due to the multiple pathogenic mechanisms involved in AD including amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation to form plaques, \u03c4 hyperphosphorylation to disrupt microtubule to form neurofibrillary tangles, calcium imbalance, enhanced oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial function, apoptotic neuronal death, and deterioration of synaptic transmission, particularly at cholinergic neurons. Approximately 100 compounds are presently been investigated directed to single targets, namely inhibitors of \u03b2 and \u03b3 secretase, vaccines or antibodies that clear A\u03b2, metal \u2026",
                "At a given cytosolic domain of a chromaffin cell, the rate and amplitude of the Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) depends on at least four efficient regulatory systems: 1) plasmalemmal calcium channels, 2) endoplasmic reticulum, 3) mitochondria, and 4) chromaffin vesicles. Different mammalian species express different levels of the L, N, P\/Q, and R subtypes of high-voltage-activated calcium channels; in bovine and humans, P\/Q channels predominate, whereas in felines and murine species, L-type channels predominate. The calcium channels in chromaffin cells are regulated by G proteins coupled to purinergic and opiate receptors, as well as by voltage and the local changes of [Ca2+]c. Chromaffin cells have been particularly useful in studying calcium channel current autoregulation by materials coreleased with catecholamines, such as ATP and opiates. Depending on the preparation (cultured cells, adrenal slices \u2026",

                "Douglas and Rubin 1 suggested that \u201cthe role of acetylcholine as a transmitter at the adrenal medulla is to cause some brief change in medullary cells which allows Ca ions to penetrate them and trigger the catecholamine ejection process\u201d. The Ca 2+-channel blocking agents, verapamil, nifedipine and nitrendipine, have been used widely to investigate the properties of slow Ca 2+ channels in a variety of tissues 2, including the adrenomedullary chromaffin cell 3, 4. Recently, small modifications to the nifedipine molecule produced a derivative, BAY-K-8644 (methyl-l, 4-dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-pyridine-5-carboxylate), that in contrast to the Ca 2+-channel blocking agents, stimulated cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contractility 5. We have tested whether this compound behaves as a Ca 2+-channel activator at the chromaffin cell membrane as shown by Schramm et al. 5 in smooth \u2026"
