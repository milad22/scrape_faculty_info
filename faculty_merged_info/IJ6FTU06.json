                "Large\u2010area MoS 2 atomic layers are synthesized on SiO 2 substrates by chemical vapor deposition using MoO 3 and S powders as the reactants. Optical, microscopic and electrical measurements suggest that the synthetic process leads to the growth of MoS 2 monolayer. The TEM images verify that the synthesized MoS 2 sheets are highly crystalline.",
                "Many customer satisfaction studies have concluded that there is a significant relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty, but this finding has been questioned in that most of the studies focus on measuring the cognitive component of customer satisfaction. This study includes the cognitive component, but focuses on the affective component. It explores the role of emotions in satisfaction, and then compares the predictive ability of the cognitive and affective elements. Key findings are that both positive and negative emotions, and the cognitive component of satisfaction correlate with loyalty. Regression analysis indicates that the affective component serves as a better predictor of customer loyalty than the cognitive component. Further, the best predictor of both overall loyalty and the most reliable dimension of loyalty, positive word of mouth, is positive emotions. Thhe theoretical and practical implications of \u2026",
                "We established a collection of 7,000 transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of GAL4 in each line is controlled by a different, defined fragment of genomic DNA that serves as a transcriptional enhancer. We used confocal microscopy of dissected nervous systems to determine the expression patterns driven by each fragment in the adult brain and ventral nerve cord. We present image data on 6,650 lines. Using both manual and machine-assisted annotation, we describe the expression patterns in the most useful lines. We illustrate the utility of these data for identifying novel neuronal cell types, revealing brain asymmetry, and describing the nature and extent of neuronal shape stereotypy. The GAL4 lines allow expression of exogenous genes in distinct, small subsets of the adult nervous system. The set of DNA fragments, each driving a documented expression pattern, will facilitate the generation of \u2026",
                "We identified the neurons comprising the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), an associative center in invertebrate brains, and provide a comprehensive map describing their potential connections. Each of the 21 MB output neuron (MBON) types elaborates segregated dendritic arbors along the parallel axons of \u223c2000 Kenyon cells, forming 15 compartments that collectively tile the MB lobes. MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB and three MBON types form a feedforward network in the lobes. Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one, or at most two, of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell\u2013MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations. The elucidation of the complement of neurons of the MB provides a comprehensive anatomical substrate from which one can infer a functional logic of associative olfactory learning and memory.DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.04577.001",
                "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding the 3\u2032 untranslated regions of target mRNAs. We examined the subcellular distribution of three miRNAs in exponentially growing HeLa cells and found that the vast majority are associated with mRNAs in polysomes. Several lines of evidence indicate that most of these mRNAs, including a known miRNA-regulated target (KRAS mRNA), are actively being translated.",
                "The purpose of this study is to develop and refine the theoretical framework underpinning consumer satisfaction emotions and re\u2010examine the emotions\/behavioral intentions link.A quantitative research design was adopted for this study. An extensive and critical review of literature related to consumer satisfaction emotions and consumer behavioral intentions led to the identification of two research questions. A self\u2010completion questionnaire was developed and administered to hospitality management graduates in Switzerland.The PCA suggested that satisfaction emotions were best conceptualized as a three\u2010dimensional construct that included positive, negative and what the present authors have labeled \u201cbi\u2010directional\u201d emotions. Moreover, a positive statistically significant relationship between \u201cbi\u2010directional\u201d emotions and consumer complaining behavior \u2026",
                "Background\u2014Considerable controversy exists regarding impairment of cardiac function in diabetes mellitus (DM). We investigated the serial changes in left ventricular (LV) histopathology and LV filling dynamics in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, which have been established as an animal model of type II DM.Methods and Results\u2014In 54 OLETF and 54 non-DM rats, body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and transmitral pulsed Doppler examinations were performed from 5 to 47 weeks of age. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed at 10, 20, and 30 weeks of age. The hearts were excised for histopathology, including immunohistochemistry and histomorphometry of collagen, and measurement of hydroxyproline at baseline and each stage of developing DM. In the prediabetic stage (15 weeks of age), in which fast blood glucose remained normal, OLETF rats manifested mild obesity \u2026"
