He subsequently became an early and continuing contributor to the new optics spawned by this development and is currently working to understand and create materials for nonlinear optical devices. At USC, Hellwarth developed a new, and now widely employed, method for reversing the lightwave pattern of an optical image, a process called \"optical beam phase conjugation,\u201d which has found application in such areas as optical tracking and pointing, spatial and temporal image processing, optical filtering and optical computing. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and holds faculty appointments in the College's physics department and the School of Engineering.
