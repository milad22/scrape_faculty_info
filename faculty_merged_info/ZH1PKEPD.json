                "PURPOSE: Unlike nodal follicular lymphoma (NFL), Primary cutaneous follicular lymphomas (PCFLs) rarely express Bcl-2 protein or t(14;18)(q32;q21) (Bcl-2\/IgH). The aim of this study was to further characterize PCFL in a large series from North America.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data and archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were obtained from 32 patients. PCFL was defined as follicular lymphoma limited to the skin at the time of diagnosis and within the first 6 months after diagnosis. Specimens were analyzed for the expression of CD3, CD10, CD20, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6 proteins by immunohistochemistry as well as for the presence of t(14;18)(q32;q21) by polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1, with a median age of 60 years. Twenty-four patients had lesions on the head and neck, five had lesions on the trunk, and three had lesions on both head and \u2026",
                "Malignant transformation of eccrine spiradenoma is extremely rare. We describe the case of a 70-year-old man with malignant eccrine spiradenoma of the forearm and metastases to the axillary lymph nodes. Surgical excision with adequate margins and lymph node dissection was performed. Tamoxifen therapy was instituted after obtaining positive immunostaining results for estrogen receptor. After 41 months of follow-up, there has been no recurrence or distant metastases. Wide local excision and close follow-up are crucial in the management of malignant eccrine spiradenoma. The role of other therapeutic modalities, including hormonal therapy, remains to be determined.",
                "This study compared the activity of ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam and ceftazidime\u2013avibactam against 120 bacterial strains, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.In vitro susceptibility was tested using the Etest strip minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and PCR was used to characterize the carbapenemase enzymes produced by CRE strains.All 29 ESBL isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime\u2013avibactam (MIC50 0.125 \u03bcg\/ml), whereas all but one were susceptible to ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam (MIC50 0.38 \u03bcg\/ml). Twenty-seven (45%) CRE isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime\u2013avibactam (MIC50 \u2265256 \u03bcg\/ml), whereas only six (10%) isolates were susceptible to ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam \u2026",
                "Transformation of polycythemia vera to chronic myelogenous leukemia is a rare event. We report 2 women with long-standing polycythemia vera who developed chronic myelogenous leukemia. Both patients had no BCR\/ABL1 fusion at the time of polycythemia vera diagnosis but were positive for the fusion at chronic myelogenous leukemia onset. Most patients with polycythemia vera have JAK2V617F mutation. Analysis of an archival bone marrow aspirate sample from 1 patient showed a heterozygous mutation status. The blood and bone marrow samples from the other patient showed the presence of homozygous JAK2V617F mutation and BCR\/ABL1 fusion. The possible pathogenesis of such an event is discussed in the light of current literature.",
                "Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus septicemia was fatal in a previously healthy 47-year-old woman. The patient died suddenly in less than 12 hours after presentation, in spite of supportive measures, including ventilation, antibiotic coverage, pressor therapy, and multiple transfusions of blood products. The diagnosis of infection due to an unusual organism was suspected earlier in the course of management after review of the peripheral blood smear. The importance of the findings in the blood smear and their correlation with infection due to this organism are discussed.",
                " Context.\u2014The World Health Organization classification recommends categorizing grade 3 follicular lymphomas based on the presence of centrocytes (grade 3A) or of sheets of centroblasts (grade 3B). The clinical significance of this practice is not known. Objective.\u2014To determine whether grade 3 follicular lymphoma subtype is associated with prognosis. Design.\u2014Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Main Outcome Measure.\u2014Overall survival. Results.\u2014Forty-five cases of grade 3 follicular lymphoma without diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were studied (35 cases of grade 3A, 10 cases of grade 3B) from 21 men and 24 women (median age, 67 years; mean age, 63.8 years; range, 26\u201386 years). Follow-up information from the time of diagnosis was available in all patients, with a median follow-up time of 24 months (mean, 34 months; range, 2\u2013 115 months \u2026",
                "We describe a patient who developed multi-organ failure with reactive hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to disseminated histoplasmosis 8 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. The patient responded fully to a prolonged course of therapy with amphotericin B and remains free of recurrence. Disseminated histoplasmosis and reactive hemophagocytic syndrome have rarely been described in the setting of cardiac transplantation and never before in combination.",
                "There is limited epidemiologic data on patients with acute myelogenous (myeloid) leukemia (AML) requiring life-sustaining therapies in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our objectives were to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in critically ill AML patients. This was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AML admitted to ICU at the University of Alberta Hospital between January 1st 2002 and June 30th 2008. Each case was matched by age, sex, and illness severity (ICU only) to two control groups: hospitalized AML controls, and non-AML ICU controls. Data were extracted on demographics, course of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes. In total, 45 AML patients with available data were admitted to ICU. Mean (SD) age was 54.8 (13.1) years and 28.9% were female. Primary diagnoses were sepsis (32.6%) and respiratory failure (37.3%). Mean (SD) APACHE II score was 30.3 (10.3), SOFA score 12.6 (4.0) with 62.2% receiving mechanical ventilation, 55.6% vasoactive therapy, and 26.7% renal replacement therapy. Crude in-hospital, 90-day and 1-year mortality was 44.4%, 51.1% and 71.1%, respectively. AML cases had significantly higher adjusted-hazards of death (HR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.38-3.60, p = 0.001) compared to both non-AML ICU controls (HR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.11-2.58, p = 0.02) and hospitalized AML controls (OR 1.0, reference variable). Factors associated with ICU mortality by univariate analysis included older age, AML subtype, higher baseline SOFA score, no change or an increase in early SOFA score, shock, vasoactive therapy and mechanical ventilation.

                "The correlation of JAK2V617F with a proportion of chronic myeloproliferative disorders has generated numerous studies focused on the development of molecular-based assays for JAK2V617F detection. The current parallel study comparatively evaluated 3 JAK2V617F molecular detection methods. Genomic DNA from blood or bone marrow was assayed by 3 laboratories using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) or kit-based restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, which used polyacrylamide gel or capillary electrophoresis analysis. In addition, samples were sequenced in 2 of the laboratories. Results found 100% concordance among the 3 methods, with analytic sensitivities of 5% for both kit methods and 0.01% for AS-PCR. The kit-based assays detect JAK2V617F with equal sensitivity regardless of analysis method, and, despite greater sensitivity of AS-PCR, all 3 methods yielded \u2026",
                "In this case, we report an elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays who had recurrent Candida auris (C. auris) in blood despite antifungal therapy. C. auris was misidentified using conventional automated identification system as Candida haemulonii resulting in delayed diagnosis. The isolate showed increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to different antifungal drugs and persisted in the patient\u2019s blood before the patient deceased. This is the first case of C. auris reported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE); laboratories should be aware of this Candida species and should confirm suspected cases since it is an emerging multi-drug resistant and health-care associated Candida."
