Neilsen received a doctoral degree in physics from the University of Texas at Austin and completed a postdoctoral appointment at Applied Research Laboratories, University of Texas at Austin, where her research focused on optimization methods for source localization and environmental characterization from multi-source sound fields in the ocean.\u00a0 Her experience includes management and analysis of large acoustical data sets, numerical modeling of acoustic propagation, and development and employment of multi-dimensional inversion techniques. After a decade studying military aircraft noise, she is returning to underwater acoustics.\u00a0 Her main projects are the application of machine learning to detecting sounds sources in a variable ocean environment and underwater acoustical measurements."
