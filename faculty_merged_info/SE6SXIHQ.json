                "Carefully tailored Fe\/Cr epitaxial superlattices with extremely thin Fe layers have been grown on MgO(100) by molecular beam epitaxy. The low\u2010angle x\u2010ray spectra reveal the presence of sharp interfaces down to an Fe layer thickness of a few monolayers. An [Fe(4.5 \u00c5)\/Cr(12 \u00c5)]50 superlattice shows a 220% magnetoresistance at 1.5 K, and a saturation field of 110 kOe. A further decrease of the Fe layer thickness produces a drastic decrease in the magnetoresistance."
