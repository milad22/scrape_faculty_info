                "The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity\u2014which cannot be explained by weak electron\u2013phonon interactions\u2014in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1\u2014the first \u2018magic\u2019angle\u2014the electronic band structure of this \u2018twisted bilayer graphene\u2019exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these \u2026",
                "Since the discovery of graphene 1, the family of two-dimensional materials has grown, displaying a broad range of electronic properties. Recent additions include semiconductors with spin\u2013valley coupling 2, Ising superconductors 3, 4, 5 that can be tuned into a quantum metal 6, possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves 7, and topological semimetals with edge transport 8, 9. However, no two-dimensional crystal with intrinsic magnetism has yet been discovered 10, 11, 12, 13, 14; such a crystal would be useful in many technologies from sensing to data storage 15. Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the two-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin\u2013Wagner theorem 16. Magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction, however, and enables, for instance, the occurrence of two-dimensional Ising ferromagnetism. Here we use magneto-optical Kerr effect \u2026",
                "A van der Waals heterostructure is a type of metamaterial that consists of vertically stacked two-dimensional building blocks held together by the van der Waals forces between the layers. This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials 1. One such property is the \u2018twist\u2019angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moir\u00e9 pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order. So far, studies of the effects of the twist angle in van der Waals heterostructures have \u2026",
                "Graphene\u2014a recently discovered form of graphite only one atomic layer thick 1\u2014constitutes a new model system in condensed matter physics, because it is the first material in which charge carriers behave as massless chiral relativistic particles. The anomalous quantization of the Hall conductance 2, 3, which is now understood theoretically 4, 5, is one of the experimental signatures of the peculiar transport properties of relativistic electrons in graphene. Other unusual phenomena, like the finite conductivity of order 4e 2\/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck\u2019s constant) at the charge neutrality (or Dirac) point 2, have come as a surprise and remain to be explained 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we experimentally study the Josephson effect 14 in mesoscopic junctions consisting of a graphene layer contacted by two closely spaced superconducting electrodes 15.

Pablo Jarillo-Herrero is currently Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at MIT. He received his \"Licenciatura\" in physics from the University of Valencia, Spain, in 1999. Then he spent two years at the University of California in San Diego, where he received a M.Sc. degree before going to the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, where he earned his Ph.D. in 2005. After a one-year postdoc in Delft, he moved to Columbia University, where he worked as a NanoResearch Initiative Fellow. He joined MIT as an assistant professor of physics in January 2008 and received tenure in 2015. He was promoted to Full Professor of Physics in 2018. His awards include the Spanish Royal Society Young Investigator Award (2006), an NSF Career Award (2008), an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship (2009), a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship (2009), the IUPAP Young Scientist Prize in Semiconductor Physics (2010), a DOE Early Career Award (2011), a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE, 2012), an ONR Young Investigator Award (2013), and a Moore Foundation Experimental Physics in Quantum Systems Investigator Award (2014). Prof. Jarillo-Herrero has been selected as a Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate Analytics-Web of Science (2017-2019), and was elected APS Fellow (2018), Fellow of the Quantum Materials Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR, 2019), and Member at Large of the APS Division of Condensed Matter Physics (2019).
