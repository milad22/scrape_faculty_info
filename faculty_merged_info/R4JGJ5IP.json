This value is smaller than the prediction of the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule by two standard deviations, and is consistent with previous measurements.

A next-to-leading order QCD analysis is used to evolve the measured g 1 p (x, Q 2) to a fixed Q 0 2.

In the Adler-Bardeen factorization scheme, \u0394 g\u2243 2 is required to bring \u0394\u03a3 in agreement with the quark-parton model.

                "Quasi-permanent magnets made of melt-textured YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 (MT-YBCO) superconductor can now trap multi-tesla fields, Bt. The interaction of the trapped field and the critical current causes an outward pressure, proportional to Bt2, which can crack the magnet. We have done an experiment to observe such cracking in a mini-magnet fabricated from four MT-YBCO discs activated at 49 K using an applied of 14 T. We have compared the results to existing theories which describe magnetic pressure in a trapped-field magnet (TFM) previously activated. We find that a modification is needed to describe magnetic pressure during the process of activation. We present the experimental results and the expanded theory, based on the simple Bean model. Theory and experiment show good agreement. We find that cracking is more likely during activation, and conclude that 10 T is achievable in TFM's composed of present \u2026",

                "We measured the spin asymmetry in the scattering of 100 GeV longitudinally-polarized muons on transversely polarized protons. The asymmetry was found to be compatible with zero in the kinematic range 0.006 < x < 0.6, 1 < Q2 < 30GeV2. From this result we derive the upper limits for the virtual photon-proton asymmetry A2, and for the spin structure function g2. For x < 0.15, A2 is significantly smaller than its positivity limit \u221aR.",
                "We present a new measurement of the spin-dependent structure function g1d of the deuteron from deep inelastic scattering of 190 GeV polarized muons on polarized deuterons. The results are combined with our previous measurements of g1d. A perturbative QCD evolution in next-to-leading order is used to compute g1d(x) at a constant Q2. At Q2 = 10 GeV2, we obtain a first moment \u03931d=\u222b1dg1ddx=0.041\u00b10.008, a flavour-singlet axial charge of the nucleon a0 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.08, and an axial charge of the strange quark as = \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.03.

                "We present a measurement of semi-inclusive spin asymmetries for positively and negatively charged hadrons from deep inelastic scattering of polarised muons on polarised protons and deuterons in the range 0.003< x< 0.7. From these asymmetries and the previously published inclusive spin asymmetries we determine, for the first time, the x-dependent spin distributions for up and down valence quarks and for non-strange sea quarks. We find that the first moments of the valence quark spin distributions are \u0394u v= 1.01\u00b10.19\u00b10.14 and \u0394d v=\u2212 0.57\u00b10.22\u00b10.11. The spin distribution function of non-strange sea quarks is consistent with zero over the measured range of x and the first moment is \u0394 u= \u0394 d=\u2212 0.02\u00b10.09\u00b10.03.",
                "Photoproduction cross sections for neutral \u03c0, \u03b7, \u03c1, and \u03c6 mesons have been measured at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center for photon energies between 5 and 17.8 GeV, and t (four-momentum transfer squared) between-0.12 and-1.4 (G e V\/c) 2, using a missing-mass technique. The pion production at lower energies is characterized by a fast falloff with increasing| t| at small| t| values, with a dip at t=\u2212 0.5 (G e V\/c) 2 followed by a secondary maximum around t=\u2212 0.9 (G e V\/c) 2 and a smooth falloff at larger| t| values. As the incident photon energy increases, the dip becomes less pronounced, in contradiction to the expectations of simple Regge theories based only on the exchange of the \u03c9 and B trajectories. \u03b7 photo-production was measured around 6 GeV and at 9 GeV. The cross section decreases smoothly with t and shows no dip at t=\u2212 0.5 (G e V\/c) 2, in disagreement with predictions based on Reggeized \u03c1 \u2026"
