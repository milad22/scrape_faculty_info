Sloan Research Fellowship Ed Bertschinger is a Professor of Physics at MIT with an affiliation in the MIT Program in Women\u2019s and Gender Studies. He is a scholar-activist-administrator for diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education. Ed served as MIT\u2019s inaugural Community and Equity Officer from 2013\u20132018 and has served on numerous national committees and task forces on equity in physics and astronomy. During 2007\u20132013 he was Physics Department Head at MIT. He is a theoretical astrophysicist whose research lies in cosmology, gravitation, and numerical methods, and whose passion lies in shifting the culture of STEM fields to be inclusive and equitable for everyone. He is a Fellow of both the APS and the AAAS and has won the MIT MLK Leadership Award, the Outstanding Freshman Advisor Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and many other awards. E.
