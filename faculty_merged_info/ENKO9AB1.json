                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "This paper describes the conclusions that can be drawn from the data taken thus far with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. In the most central Au+ Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing Au+ Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of participants at higher p T (\u223c 4 GeV\/c) is very similar to that at low transverse \u2026",
                "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (1027 cm\u22122 s\u22121). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4\u03c0 solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|\u03b7| \u2264 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.",
                "Identified charged-particle spectra of \u03c0\u00b1, K\u00b1, p, and p at midrapidity (| y|< 0. 1) measured by the dE\/dx method in the STAR (solenoidal tracker at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) time projection chamber are reported for pp and d+ Au collisions at s NN= 200 GeV and for Au+ Au collisions at 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV. Average transverse momenta, total particle production, particle yield ratios, strangeness, and baryon production rates are investigated as a function of the collision system and centrality. The transverse momentum spectra are found to be flatter for heavy particles than for light particles in all collision systems; the effect is more prominent for more central collisions. The extracted average transverse momentum of each particle species follows a trend determined by the total charged-particle multiplicity density. The Bjorken energy density estimate is at least several GeV\/fm 3 for a formation time less than \u2026",
                "Parity-odd domains, corresponding to nontrivial topological solutions of the QCD vacuum, might be created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These domains are predicted to lead to charge separation of quarks along the system\u2019s orbital momentum axis. We investigate a three-particle azimuthal correlator which is a P even observable, but directly sensitive to the charge separation effect. We report measurements of charged hadrons near center-of-mass rapidity with this observable in Au+ Au and Cu+ Cu collisions at s N N= 200 GeV using the STAR detector. A signal consistent with several expectations from the theory is detected. We discuss possible contributions from other effects that are not related to parity violation.",
                "The STAR collaboration at the BNL Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) reports measurements of the inclusive yield of nonphotonic electrons, which arise dominantly from semileptonic decays of heavy flavor mesons, over a broad range of transverse momenta (1.2< p T< 10 GeV\/c) in p+ p, d+ Au, and Au+ Au collisions at s NN= 200 GeV. The nonphotonic electron yield exhibits an unexpectedly large suppression in central Au+ Au collisions at high p T, suggesting substantial heavy-quark energy loss at RHIC. The centrality and p T dependences of the suppression provide constraints on theoretical models of suppression.",
                "Flow coefficients v n for n= 2, 3, 4, characterizing the anisotropic collective flow in Au+ Au collisions at s N N= 200 GeV, are measured relative to event planes \u03a8 n, determined at large rapidity. We report v n as a function of transverse momentum and collision centrality, and study the correlations among the event planes of different order n. The v n are well described by hydrodynamic models which employ a Glauber Monte Carlo initial state geometry with fluctuations, providing additional constraining power on the interplay between initial conditions and the effects of viscosity as the system evolves. This new constraint can serve to improve the precision of the extracted shear viscosity to entropy density ratio \u03b7\/s.",
                "We present measurements of the pseudorapidity distribution of primary charged particles produced in A u+ A u collisions at three energies, s N N= 19.6, 130, and 200 GeV, for a range of collision centralities. The distribution narrows for more central collisions and excess particles are produced at high pseudorapidity in peripheral collisions. For a given centrality, however, the distributions are found to scale with energy according to the \u201climiting fragmentation\u201d hypothesis. The universal fragmentation region described by this scaling grows in pseudorapidity with increasing collision energy, extending well away from the beam rapidity and covering more than half of the pseudorapidity range over which particles are produced. This approach to a universal limiting curve appears to be a dominant feature of the pseudorapidity distribution and therefore of the total particle production in these collisions.",
                "We present STAR results on the elliptic flow v 2 of charged hadrons, strange and multistrange particles from s NN= 200 GeV Au+ Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The detailed study of the centrality dependence of v 2 over a broad transverse momentum range is presented. Comparisons of different analysis methods are made in order to estimate systematic uncertainties. To discuss the nonflow effect, we have performed the first analysis of v 2 with the Lee-Yang zero method for K S 0 and \u039b. In the relatively low p T region, p T\u2a7d 2 GeV\/c, a scaling with m T\u2212 m is observed for identified hadrons in each centrality bin studied. However, we do not observe v 2 (p T) scaled by the participant eccentricity to be independent of centrality. At higher p T, 2\u2a7d p T\u2a7d 6 GeV\/c, v 2 scales with quark number for all hadrons studied. For the multistrange hadron \u03a9, which does not suffer appreciable hadronic \u2026",
                "The STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider presents a systematic study of high-transverse-momentum charged-di-hadron correlations at small azimuthal pair separation \u0394 \u03d5 in d+ Au and central Au+ Au collisions at s NN= 200 GeV. Significant correlated yield for pairs with large longitudinal separation \u0394 \u03b7 is observed in central Au+ Au collisions, in contrast to d+ Au collisions. The associated yield distribution in \u0394 \u03b7\u00d7 \u0394 \u03d5 can be decomposed into a narrow jet-like peak at small angular separation which has a similar shape to that found in d+ Au collisions, and a component that is narrow in \u0394 \u03d5 and depends only weakly on \u0394 \u03b7, the \u201cridge.\u201d Using two systematically independent determinations of the background normalization and shape, finite ridge yield is found to persist for trigger p t> 6 GeV\/c, indicating that it is correlated with jet production.
