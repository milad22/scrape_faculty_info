Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Tennessee, Knoxville We are exploring novel physical phenomena \n\t\t\tby studying electronic, magnetic, and superconducting behaviors in (topological) quantum materials as well as potential quantum device applications in quantum computing and spintronics! Experimental schemes of molecular beam epitaxy ; \n\t\t\tstructural, electronical, and magnetic characterizations ; \n\t\t\tfabrication of mesoscopic and nanoscale devices ; \n\t\t\telectrical transport using cryostats are used for our research. Selected Research Topics are listed below. Details can be found in the \"RESEARCH\" page. Epitaxy of Quantum Materials Quantum Transport Topological Quantum Computing [Openings] We are currently recruiting graduate and undergraduate students.\n\t  If you are interested in quantum materials, nano-scale devices, and quantum transport as well as applications of quantum materials,\n\t      contact us!
