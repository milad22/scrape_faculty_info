Herman 105 SW 26th St. Corvallis, OR 97331 greg.herman@oregonstate.edu Office Phone: 541-737-2496 Chemical, Biological & Environmental Engineering Professor and Head James and Shirley Kuse Chair in Chemical Engineering Expertise and Interests: Gregory Herman\u2019s research expertise covers the detailed characterization of materials using surface science techniques. We perform ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ambient-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy to obtain a fundamental mechanistic understanding of reactions at surfaces. Applications include: the design of new catalysts to better control reaction selectivities and activities; characterizing radiation induced mechanisms for advanced semiconductor manufacturing; and design of novel sensors and understanding their surface chemistries.
