                "In this paper, we review recent theoretical progress and the latest experimental results in jet substructure from the Tevatron and the LHC. We review the status of and outlook for calculation and simulation tools for studying jet substructure. Following up on the report of the Boost 2010 workshop, we present a new set of benchmark comparisons of substructure techniques, focusing on the set of variables and grooming methods that are collectively known as' top taggers'. To facilitate further exploration, we have attempted to collect, harmonize and publish software implementations of these techniques.",
                "Dark matter direct detection searches for signals coming from dark matter scattering against nuclei at a very low recoil energy scale~ 10 keV. In this paper, a simple non-relativistic effective theory is constructed to describe interactions between dark matter and nuclei without referring to any underlying high energy models. It contains the minimal set of operators that will be tested by direct detection. The effective theory approach highlights the set of distinguishable recoil spectra that could arise from different theoretical models. If dark matter is discovered in the near future in direct detection experiments, a measurement of the shape of the recoil spectrum will provide valuable information on the underlying dynamics. We bound the coefficients of the operators in our non-relativistic effective theory by the null results of current dark matter direct detection experiments. We also discuss the mapping between the non \u2026",
                "We present a broad class of supersymmetric models that preserve R-parity but lack missing energy signatures. These models are significantly less constrained than traditional supersymmetry by emerging LHC limits that rely on missing energy signatures, and therefore require less tuning to accommodate experimental results. They have new light particles with weak-scale supersymmetric masses that feel SUSY breaking only through couplings to the MSSM. This small SUSY breaking leads to nearly degenerate fermion\/boson pairs with small mass splittings, and hence small phase space for decays carrying away invisible energy. The simplest scenario has low-scale SUSY breaking, with missing energy only from soft gravitinos. This scenario is natural, lacks artificial tunings to produce a squeezed spectrum, and is consistent with gauge coupling unification. The resulting collider signals will be jet-rich events \u2026"

She works on particle theories, in particular, beyond Standard Model theories such as Higgs phenomenology, supersymmetry, dark matter models and signatures. Her research is at the interface between elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. It combines both theoretical model building and numerical data analyses. Fan received her Ph. D degree in theoretical particle physics from Yale University in 2009. Then she worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University for three years and at Harvard University for one year. She moved to Brown University in 2015 as as assistant professor after spending two years as an assistant professor at Syracuse University.
