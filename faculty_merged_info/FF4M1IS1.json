                "Two dimensional nanoarchitectures are of great interest in lithium storage for energy\u2010storage devices, in particular lithium\u2010ion batteries, due to its shortened paths for fast lithium ion diffusion and large exposed surface offering more lithium\u2010insertion channels. Their competitive lithium\u2010storage features provide huge potentials to develop next\u2010generation high\u2010performance lithium\u2010ion batteries. This review is devoted to the recent progress in the fabrication of innovative 2D structures with various synthetic strategies and their applications for lithium storage in lithium\u2010ion batteries. These 2D architectures are categorized into six styles, i.e., nanoporous nanosheets, ultrathin nanosheets, flower\u2010like structures assembled by nanosheets, sandwich\u2010like nanosheets, corrugated nanosheets, and nanosheets with specific facets. Based on the lithium\u2010storage manner, we further summerized their electrochemical performance \u2026",
                "A thiol group introduced on the \u03b3-carbon of lysine mediates robust native chemical ligation at both the \u03b1- and \u03b5-amines in two consecutive steps. Desulfurization then affords the final product, in which the lysine residue at the ligation site has an isopeptide bond on its side chain. The method is useful for the synthesis of proteins containing special post-translational modifications on lysine.",

                "A clean reaction strategy based on thermally eliminating lactam bridges from a soluble acene precursor through a retro\u2010Diels\u2013Alder reaction, led to the synthesis and characterization of a novel, stable, green crystalline 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 21\u2010hexaphenyl\u20101.22, 4.5, 11.12, 15.16\u2010tetrabenzononatwistacene. An analysis of the single crystal structure of the nonatwistacene indicates that this molecule is twisted at an angle of 25.44.",

                "Chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans are sulfated polysaccharides involved in cell division, neuronal development, and spinal cord injury. Here, we report the synthesis and identification of a chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharide that stimulates the growth and differentiation of neurons. These studies represent the first, direct investigations into the structure\u2212activity relationships of chondroitin sulfate using homogeneous synthetic molecules and define a tetrasaccharide as a minimal motif required for activity.

                "Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) serves as an efficient electron\u2010transport channel between dye molecules and the electrode in a dye\u2010sensitized solar cell due to the formation of an rGO\u2013TiO 2 Schottky barrier junction, which can improve the interface contact between dye and TiO 2 effectively and therefore enhance the photogenerated\u2010electron transport\/injection efficiency in the photoanode (see figure).",

                "Highly active Pt-decorated Au nanoparticles on carbon support with Pt:Au mole ratio ranging from 1:10 to 1:2 was successfully synthesized based on successive reduction strategy. The successful formation of this structure was suggested by transmission electron microscopy, UV\u2013vis and voltammetry analyses. The electrocatalytic activity of this decorated structure toward formic acid oxidation surprisingly increases despite the low amount of Pt being used. At 0.1 V, the specific activity of PtAu\/C with Pt\/Au mole ratio 1:8 was more than one order of magnitude higher than the conventional Pt\/C. The enhancement was attributed to the less Pt ensemble sites that the decorated structure possesses (ensemble effect) and the increase in the Pt atom reactivity on Au nanocrystal. The formic acid oxidation mechanism on this decorated structure was also elucidated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. It is \u2026"
