In recent years my research has focused on the connection between physics and information. One goal has been to develop a general framework of entropic inference that allows one to tackle the central issues in a unified manner. The framework allows one to address questions that concern the nature of information and how it is to be processed: What is information? Or, from a Bayesian perspective, how is information related to the beliefs of rational agents? How does one update from prior probabilities to posterior probabilities when new information becomes available? Are Bayesian and maximum entropy methods compatible with each other? The other goal has been to explore the extent to which the laws of physics might reflect the rules for processing information about nature. More specifically the objective is to derive statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity as applications of entropic inference. For statistical mechanics this goal was largely achieved in the work of E.T. Jaynes. My recent work has focused on the application to quantum theory. So far progress along this line of research has been reassuringly successful. My papers on entropic inference and on its applications to the foundations of statistical mechanics and of quantum mechanics can be found here and my lecture notes are here . Selected Recent Publications on Entropic Inference: The general framework of entropic and Bayesian inference and its application to statistical and quantum mechanics is the general subject of the course APhy-640 Information Physics. This material is collected into the following (evolving) set of lectures, \u201c Entropic Inference and the Foundations of Physics \u201d invited monograph published by the Brazilian Chapter of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis\u2014ISBrA (Sao Paulo, Brazil 2012).
