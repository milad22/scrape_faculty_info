Kramer Director of STEM Transformation Institute; Professor STEM Transformation Institute; Physics VH 140C, CP 211 305-348-6073 kramerl@fiu.edu Physics Education Research Laird Kramer's work focuses on facilitating institutional change through implementation of, and research on, evidence-based educational practices. He led transformation of the undergraduate physics experience at FIU, creating more well-prepared majors through the implementation modeling instruction-based studio physics courses, establishment of student-centric methodologies, and establishment of a high school\/university research and learning community. Kramer has fostered a community that enables future teachers to implement their instructional craft, built by operating more than a decade of intensive, summer professional development in Modeling Instruction for high school teachers."
