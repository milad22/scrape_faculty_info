                "Competition between magnetism and the kinetic energy of mobile carriers (typically holes) in doped antiferromagnets may lead to \u2018stripe\u2019phases 1, 2, 3, 4, which are charged rivers separating regions of oppositely phased antiferromagnetism. In copper oxides the main experimental evidence for such coexisting static spin and charge order comes from neutron scattering in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 (LNSCO; ref. 5) and La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 (LBCO; ref. 6). However, as a neutron is neutral, it does not detect charge but rather its associated lattice distortion 7, so it is not known whether the stripes involve ordering of the doped holes. Here we present a study of the charge order in LBCO with resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS). We observe giant resonances near the Fermi level as well as near the correlated gap 8, 9, demonstrating significant modulation in both the doped-hole density and the \u2018Mottness\u2019, or the \u2026",
                "Determining the nature of the electronic phases that compete with superconductivity in high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors is one of the deepest problems in condensed matter physics. One candidate is the \u2018stripe\u2019phase 1, 2, 3, in which the charge carriers (holes) condense into rivers of charge that separate regions of antiferromagnetism. A related but lesser known system is the \u2018spin ladder\u2019, which consists of two coupled chains of magnetic ions forming an array of rungs. A doped ladder can be thought of as a high-T c material with lower dimensionality, and has been predicted to exhibit both superconductivity 4, 5, 6 and an insulating \u2018hole crystal\u20194, 7, 8 phase in which the carriers are localized through many-body interactions. The competition between the two resembles that believed to operate between stripes and superconductivity in high-T c materials 9. Here we report the existence of a hole \u2026",
                "Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum\u2010resolved electron energy\u2010loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T\u2010TiSe2. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in \u2026"

He then went to the University of Groningen in The Netherlands on an IRFAP fellowship from the National Science Foundation. In 2001, he returned to the U.S. as a postdoc in biophysics at Cornell University, where he studied photosynthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides , and joined the scientific staff at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2003. He was recruited to the Department of Physics in August of 2005. Professor Abbamonte is one of the originators of the technique of resonant soft x-ray scattering, which he has used, among other things, to discover a Wigner crystal in doped spin ladders, and to show that stripes in copper-oxide superconductors are charged.  This technique is now in use at every major synchrotron facility in the world.  He is also known for his solution to the phase problem for inelastic x-ray scattering, permitting real-time imaging of electron motion in condensed matter with attosecond time resolution.  He has recently used this approach, for example, to image the formation of excitons in insulators, and to measure the effective fine structure constant of graphene. Abbamonte is the founder of Inprentus, a premium optics manufacturer based at the University of Illinois Research Park. Research Interests electron self-organization in condensed matter, stripe phases, topological order; edge and interface effects in oxide devices; quantum phase transitions; collective excitations in interacting electron systems.

Science 297 , 581-584 (2002) Full publication list New Energy Frontiers Research Center, led by Abbamonte, awarded $12.6M by DOE A team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\u2019s Grainger College of Engineering was awarded an Energy Frontier Research Center by the Department of Energy (EFRC). Illinois Physics Professor Peter Abbamonte is the primary investigator. Research Funding Abbamonte and Madhavan named EPiQS investigators The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , through its Emergent Phenomena in Quantum Systems Initiative (EPiQS), has awarded substantial research funding to two experimental condensed matter physicists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Physics Professors Peter Abbamonte and Vidya Madhavan will receive EPiQS Experimental Investigator awards of $1.6 million each over the next five years. EPiQS prioritizes high-risk, high-reward fundamental research programs in quantum materials, to foster scientific breakthroughs. EPiQS experimental investigators have the freedom to pursue challenging and novel research directions of the scientists\u2019 own choosing. Strange metal charge is localized in both space and time The Abbamonte lab has discovered that, unlike normal metals where charge flows like waves, charge in so-called \u201cstrange metals\u201d cannot freely propagate and is instead highly localized in space and time. These findings were published in a paper titled, \u201cCrossover of Charge Fluctuations across the Strange Metal Phase Diagram,\u201d published December 2019 in Physical Review X . Condensed Matter Experiment Condensed Matter Theory Unraveling the stripe order mystery One of the greatest mysteries in condensed matter physics is the exact relationship between charge order and superconductivity in cuprate superconductors. In superconductors, electrons move freely through the material\u2014there is zero resistance when it\u2019s cooled below its critical temperature. However, the cuprates simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and charge order in patterns of alternating stripes. This is paradoxical in that charge order describes areas of confined electrons. How can superconductivity and charge order coexist? Now researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, collaborating with scientists at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, have shed new light on how these disparate states can exist adjacent to one another. Illinois Physics post-doctoral researcher Matteo Mitrano, Professor Peter Abbamonte, and their team applied a new x-ray scattering technique, time-resolved resonant soft x-ray scattering, taking advantage of the state-of-the-art equipment at SLAC. This method enabled the scientists to probe the striped charge order phase with an unprecedented energy resolution. This is the first time this has been done at an energy scale relevant to superconductivity."
