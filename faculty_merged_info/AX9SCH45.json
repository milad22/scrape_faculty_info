My research work can be divided into applications of\u00a0ionizing\n                  radiation and non-ionizing radiation. The work in the field of ionizing radiation\n                  has\u00a0been in many areas such as nuclear medicine, health physics, and recently, CT\n                  and fluoroscopy\u00a0in collaboration with researchers in Brazil when I was there as a\n                  Visiting Professor. The bulk of\u00a0my contribution has been in the area of magnetic resonance\n                  spectroscopy especially in the\u00a0clinical application of the technique in hepatic encephalopathy,\n                  prostate, and breast cancer. For\u00a0more than 15 years, I have worked with Dr. M.A. Thomas\n                  at UCLA experimenting and\u00a0enhancing the technical aspects of clinical applications\n                  from one spectral dimension to\u00a0multidimensional spectroscopy. This has produced over\n                  50 publications and presentations to a\u00a0large and varied audience. Scientists rarely have the opportunity to do something in the field of arts. I was\n                  lucky to be\u00a0commissioned by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) and Hiroshima\u00a0International\n                  Council for Health Care of the Radiation-exposed (HICARE) to make a\u00a0documentary on\n                  the effects of the atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I\u00a0interviewed survivors\n                  and scientists and created two documentaries that were unusual in their\u00a0perspective\n                  and circulated for use by professors teaching effects of radiation to health and\u00a0medical\n                  physicists. 1.
