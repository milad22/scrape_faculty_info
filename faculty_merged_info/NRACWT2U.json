                "Determining whether Earth-like planets are common or rare looms as a touchstone in the question of life in the universe. We searched for Earth-size planets that cross in front of their host stars by examining the brightness measurements of 42,000 stars from National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Kepler mission. We found 603 planets, including 10 that are Earth size () and receive comparable levels of stellar energy to that of Earth (). We account for Kepler\u2019s imperfect detectability of such planets by injecting synthetic planet\u2013caused dimmings into the Kepler brightness measurements and recording the fraction detected. We find that 11 \u00b1 4% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet receiving between one and four times the stellar intensity as Earth. We also find that the occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with increasing orbital period (P), within equal intervals of logP up to \u223c200 d. Extrapolating \u2026",
                "The size of a planet is an observable property directly connected to the physics of its formation and evolution. We used precise radius measurements from the California-Kepler Survey to study the size distribution of 2025 Kepler planets in fine detail. We detect a factor of\u2265 2 deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1.5\u20132.0. This gap splits the population of close-in (P< 100 days) small planets into two size regimes:  and , with few planets in between. Planets in these two regimes have nearly the same intrinsic frequency based on occurrence measurements that account for planet detection efficiencies. The paucity of planets between 1.5 and 2.0 supports the emerging picture that close-in planets smaller than Neptune are composed of rocky cores measuring 1.5 or smaller with varying amounts of low-density gas that determine their total sizes.",
                "We report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 Kepler stars. There are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detected through transits and 7 revealed by precise Doppler measurements of the host stars. Based on an analysis of the Kepler brightness measurements, along with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky \u2026",
                "We search for evidence of a light scalar boson in the radiative decays of the \u03a5 (2 S) and \u03a5 (3 S) resonances: \u03a5 (2 S, 3 S)\u2192 \u03b3 A 0, A 0\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212. Such a particle appears in extensions of the standard model, where a light C P-odd Higgs boson naturally couples strongly to b quarks. We find no evidence for such processes in the mass range 0.212\u2264 m A 0\u2264 9.3 GeV in the samples of 99\u00d7 10 6 \u03a5 (2 S) and 122\u00d7 10 6 \u03a5 (3 S) decays collected by the BABAR detector at the SLAC PEP-II B factory and set stringent upper limits on the effective coupling of the b quark to the A 0. We also limit the dimuon branching fraction of the \u03b7 b meson: B (\u03b7 b\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212)< 0.9% at 90% confidence level.",
                "We present astrophysical false positive probability calculations for every Kepler Object of Interest (KOI)\u2014the first large-scale demonstration of a fully automated transiting planet validation procedure. Out of 7056 KOIs, we determine that 1935 have probabilities< 1% of being astrophysical false positives, and thus may be considered validated planets. Of these, 1284 have not yet been validated or confirmed by other methods. In addition, we identify 428 KOIs that are likely to be false positives, but have not yet been identified as such, though some of these may be a result of unidentified transit timing variations. A side product of these calculations is full stellar property posterior samplings for every host star, modeled as single, binary, and triple systems. These calculations use vespa, a publicly available Python package that is able to be easily applied to any transiting exoplanet candidate.",
                "We carry out an independent search of Kepler photometry for small transiting planets with sizes 0.5-8.0 times that of Earth and orbital periods between 5 and 50 days, with the goal of measuring the fraction of stars harboring such planets. We use a new transit search algorithm, TERRA, optimized to detect small planets around photometrically quiet stars. We restrict our stellar sample to include the 12,000 stars having the lowest photometric noise in the Kepler survey, thereby maximizing the detectability of Earth-size planets. We report 129 planet candidates having radii less than 6 R E found in three years of Kepler photometry (quarters 1-12). Forty-seven of these candidates are not in Batalha et al., which only analyzed photometry from quarters 1-6. We gather Keck HIRES spectra for the majority of these targets leading to precise stellar radii and hence precise planet radii. We make a detailed measurement of the \u2026",
                "The distribution of planet sizes encodes details of planet formation and evolution. We present the most precise planet size distribution to date based on Gaia parallaxes, Kepler photometry, and spectroscopic temperatures from the California-Kepler Survey. Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the errors are now 3%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5% precision. With a catalog of~ 1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially filled in. Two \u2026",
                "Various theoretical models treating the effect of stellar irradiation on planetary envelopes predict the presence of a radius valley, i.e. a bimodal distribution of planet radii, with super-Earths and sub-Neptune planets separated by a valley at around . Such a valley has been observed recently, owing to an improvement in the precision of stellar and therefore planetary radii. Here, we investigate the presence, location, and shape of such a valley using a small sample with highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology, which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 3.3 per\u2009cent. We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths () and sub-Neptunes (\u22482.5\u2009R\u2295) separated by a deficiency around . We furthermore characterize the slope of the valley as a power law R\u221dP\u03b3 with . A negative slope is consistent with models of \u2026",
                "Small, cool planets represent the typical end-products of planetary formation. Studying the architectures of these systems, measuring planet masses and radii, and observing these planets' atmospheres during transit directly informs theories of planet assembly, migration, and evolution. Here we report the discovery of three small planets orbiting a bright (K s= 8.6 mag) M0 dwarf using data collected as part of K2, the new ecliptic survey using the re-purposed Kepler spacecraft. Stellar spectroscopy and K2 photometry indicate that the system hosts three transiting planets with radii 1.5\u20132.1, straddling the transition region between rocky and increasingly volatile-dominated compositions. With orbital periods of 10\u201345 days the planets receive just 1.5\u201310\u00d7 the flux incident on Earth, making these some of the coolest small planets known orbiting a nearby star; planet d is located near the inner edge of the system's \u2026",
                "We present 197 planet candidates discovered using data from the first year of the NASA K2 mission (Campaigns 0\u20134), along with the results of an intensive program of photometric analyses, stellar spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation. We distill these candidates into sets of 104 validated planets (57 in multi-planet systems),  false positives, and 63 remaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with median values of R P= , P=  days, =  K, and Kp=  mag. Stellar spectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of these systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets known to orbit moderately bright stars (1\u20134 R\u2295, Kp= 9\u201313 mag). Of particular interest are  planets smaller than 2 R\u2295,  orbiting stars brighter than Kp= 11.5 mag, 5 receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet systems \u2026"
