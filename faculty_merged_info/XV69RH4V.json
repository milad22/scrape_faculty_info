                "The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential type of cellular plasticity associated with a change from epithelial cells that function as a barrier consisting of a sheet of tightly connected cells to cells with properties of mesenchyme that are not attached to their neighbors and are highly motile. This phenotypic change occurs during development and also contributes to pathological processes, such as cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms controlling the switch between the fully epithelial and fully mesenchymal phenotypes and cells that have characteristics of both (partial EMT) are controversial, and multiple theoretical models have been proposed. To test these theoretical models, we systematically measured the changes in the abundance of proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that represent the core regulators of EMT induced by transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in \u2026",
                "Recent simulation studies for four dipole-polarizable and for two fluctuating-charge water force fields have demonstrated that none of the force fields studied is capable of yielding a satisfactory description of the vapor\u2212liquid coexistence curve from room temperature to the critical region. The performance of these polarizable force fields can be improved dramatically by introducing an additional coupling between the Lennard\u2212Jones interaction parameters for a pair of oxygen sites and their partial charges (electronic configuration). Two different types of water models are presented which are based on either the three-site simple point charge (SPC) or the four-site transferable intermolecular potential 4 point (TIP4P) water representations. Adiabatic nuclear and electronic sampling Monte Carlo (ANES-MC) simulations in the Gibbs, isobaric\u2212isothermal, and canonical ensembles were performed to calculate vapor\u2212liquid \u2026"

Based on Brahe\u2019s decades of observation, Kepler had the ingenious insight to identify the laws of planetary motion, which later lead to formation of \u00a0Newton\u2019s theory of universal gravitation. Nowadays with technical advances biological data are collected at a rate far beyond \u00a0Brahe would \u00a0have imaged, and machine learning algorithms including artificial intellegence greatly\u00a0facilitate pattern finding from large data sets compared to the challenges Kepler had faced. Now we are searching for general and specific principles as Newton did at his time. So it has never been a better time for physicists to study biological problems. Speficically, my lab asks the question how a cell maintains and controls its phenotype.\u00a0Cells from multicellular organisms can have identical genomes but different phenotypes with different physiology and functions. During development, embryonic stem cells differentiate into different phenotypes and differentiated cells can also reprogram into another phenotype. In the languarage of physics a cell is a nonlinear dynamical systems, and a stable phenotype corresponds to a stable attractor or limit cycle of the dynamical system. Cell phenotypic transitions (CPTs) are examples of rate\u00a0processes.\u00a0Rate theories have been central topic in physics and chemistry for more than century, and recently cell phenoptypic transitions emerge as a new frontier of rate theory studies about transition dynamics in nonequilibrium systems. My lab\u00a0studies CPTs through\u00a0quantitative single cell measurements, \u00a0and computational\/theoretical analyses.
