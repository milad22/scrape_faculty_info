                "In this work, surfactant-free atomically ultrathin Rh nanosheet nanoassemblies (Rh NNs) are synthesized and used for the first time as an effective electrocatalyst in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient temperature and pressure. The inorganic polymer RhCl3\u2013K3Co(CN)6 cyanogel plays an important role in the generation of ultrathin Rh nanosheets with a clean surface. Due to their unique ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheet structure (ca. 1 nm) with a high specific surface area and modified electronic structure, the surfactant-free Rh NNs demonstrate an excellent catalytic activity for the NRR with a high production yield (NH3: 23.88 \u03bcg h\u22121 mgcat\u22121) and favorable selectivity (no N2H4 generation) at low potential (\u22120.2 V vs. RHE), outperforming most of the current electrocatalysts reported for the NRR. Except the contribution to the efficient NRR electrocatalysis, this synthesis strategy would provide some \u2026",
                "Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) have great activity as a green energy conversion device. However, the weak activity of most anode electrocatalysts for the C\uf8ffC bond cleavage is an obstacle to the DEFCs development. Herein, a simple galvanic replacement reaction strategy to synthesize hollow and porous PtRhCu trimetallic nanoboxes (CNBs) with a tunable Pt\/Rh atomic ratio is developed. For the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), PtRhCu CNBs show morphology and composition\u2010dependent electrocatalytic activity. The composition optimized Pt54Rh4Cu42 CNBs exhibit excellent specific and mass activity and stability for the EOR, which is attributed to its unique geometric structure and synergistic effects. The hollow porous structure can effectively enhance the atomic utilization and mass transfer. The introduction of Cu improves the antipoisoning capability for CO. The introduction of Rh elevates the self \u2026",
                "Novel self-assembled architectures have received a growing amount of attention and have significant potential for application in catalysis\/electrocatalysis. Herein, we take advantage of the unique coordination and self-assembly properties of arginine for the preparation of dendritic PtCu bimetallic nanoassemblies with tunable chemical composition and structure. Strong interactions between the arginine molecules are key in driving the self-assembly of primary nanocrystals. In addition, the strong coordination interactions between arginine and metal ions is responsible for the formation of Pt\u2013Cu alloys. We also investigated the electrocatalytic activity of various dendritic PtCu bimetallic nanoassemblies towards the methanol oxidation reaction. Pt3Cu1 nanoassemblies exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability in comparison with other PtCu bimetallic nanoassemblies (Pt1Cu3, Pt1Cu1) and \u2026",
                "Noble metal nanostructures (NMNSs) play a crucial role in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Hollow and porous NMNSs possess generally prominent advantages over their solid counterparts due to their unordinary structural features. In this work, we describe a facial one-pot synthesis of hollow and porous Pd\u2013Cu alloy nanospheres (Pd\u2013Cu HPANSs) through a polyethylenimine (PEI)-assisted oxidation\u2013dissolution mechanism. The strong coordination interaction between CuII and PEI facilitates the oxidation\u2013dissolution of the Cu2O nanospheres template under air conditions, which is responsible for the generation of the Pd\u2013Cu alloy and the convenient removal of the Cu2O nanospheres template at room temperature. Compared to the commercial Pd black, the Pd\u2013Cu HPANSs show remarkably improved catalytic activity for the reduction of K2Cr2O7 by HCOOH at room temperature, attributing to the \u2026",
                "Although nanostructures based on noble metal alloys are widely utilized in (electro)catalysis, their low-temperature synthesis remains an enormous challenge due to the different Nernst equilibrium potentials of metal precursors. Herein, we describe the successful synthesis of trimetallic PtRhNi alloy nanoassemblies (PtRhNi-ANAs) with tunable Pt\/Rh ratios using a simple mixed cyanogel reduction method and provide a detailed characterization of their chemical composition, morphology, and structure. Additionally, the electrochemical properties of PtRhNi-ANAs are examined by cyclic voltammetry, revealing composition-dependent electrocatalytic activity in the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Compared to a commercial Pt black electrocatalyst, optimized Pt3Rh1Ni2-ANAs display remarkably enhanced EOR electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media.",
                "Designing the low cost, active, durable, and alcohol-tolerant cathode catalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for the large-scale commercialization of direct alcohol fuel cells. Recently, Pd-based nanocrystals have attracted attention as Pt-alternative cathode catalysts towards the ORR in the alkaline electrolyte. Unfortunately, the pristine Pd-based nanocrystals lack the selectivity towards the ORR due to their inherent activity for the alcohol molecule oxidation reaction in the alkaline electrolyte. In this work, polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified AuPd alloy nanocrystals with Au-rich AuPd alloy cores and Pd-rich PdAu alloy shells (AuPd@PdAu-PEI) are successfully synthesized using a traditional chemical reduction method in presence of PEI. The rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique is applied to evaluate the ORR performance of AuPd@PdAu-PEI nanocrystals. Compared with commercial Pd \u2026",
                "The development of active and methanol-tolerant cathode electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely important for accelerating the commercial viability of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). In this work, we present an efficient and template-free route for facile synthesis of cyanide (CN\u2212)-functionalized PtNi hollow nanospheres (PtNi@CN HNSs) with a high alloying degree using a simple cyanogel reduction method at room temperature. The physical and electrocatalytic properties of the PtNi@CN HNSs were investigated by various physical and electrochemical techniques. The PtNi@CN HNSs exhibited significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity, durability, and particular methanol tolerance for the ORR as compared to commercial Pt black, and thus they are promising cathode electrocatalysts for DMFCs.",
                "Alkaline direct formate fuel cells (ADFFC) are emerging as a propitious candidate for green energy conversion devices. However, the poor electrocatalytic activity and stability of anodic electrocatalysts are immense challenges for its full-scale commercialization. In the current work, Pt\u2013Ag alloy nanoballoon nanoassemblies (ANBNSs) were easily synthesized by the galvanic replacement reaction between three-dimensionally multibranched Ag nanoflowers and K2PtCl4. Electrochemical results exhibit that Pt\u2013Ag ANBNSs have a nearly 19.3-fold activity enhancement for the formate oxidation reaction (FOR) over commercial Pt nanoparticles in alkaline media, as well as a higher resistance to CO poisoning and excellent durability for the FOR. This work demonstrates that Pt\u2013Ag ANBNSs are indeed highly promising active and durable electrocatalysts for the FOR due to the integration of geometric\/electronic effects and \u2026"
