I use spectroscopic observations in the optical, UV and X-rays\n                           to understand the plasma physics of the shocks, and how energetic cosmic rays are\n                           accelerated at shock transitions. I also use mid-infrared spectroscopy to study how\n                           astrophysical dust (both in supernova ejecta and in the interstellar medium) is heated\n                           and destroyed in shocks. In my research I use both ground-based observatories and\n                           space-based facilities, the latter including the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Herschel\n                           Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory."
