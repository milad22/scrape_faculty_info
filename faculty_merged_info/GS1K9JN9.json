                "A unified shell-model description of nuclear deformation valid throughout the periodic table is presented. Microscopic calculations for the Zr and Mo isotopes are carried out in the frameworks of the shell model and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method, respectively, to study the shape transition in these nuclei. It is shown that deformation is produced by the isoscalar component of the neutron-proton (n\u2212 p) interaction in this region, as in the lighter (2 s, 1 d)-shell region. Deformation sets in when the T= 0 n\u2212 p interaction dominates over the sphericity-favoring pairing interaction between T= 1 pairs of nucleons. When shell effects are important, as for the light and medium-weight regions mentioned above, the simultaneous occupation of neutrons and protons of spin-orbit\" partner\" orbitals plays a crucial role in determining the onset of deformation. However, their effect is probably less important in the rare-earth and \u2026",

                "The use of exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin models to describe the physics of systems with strong pair correlations is reviewed. The article begins with a brief discussion of Richardson\u2019s early work, which demonstrated the exact solvability of the pure pairing model, and then shows how that work has evolved recently into a much richer class of exactly solvable models. The Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between these quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This analogy is then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit of the pure pairing Hamiltonian. Several applications to problems of relevance to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of confined systems are considered. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed in the context of these exactly solvable models include (i) the crossover from \u2026",
                "An improved prescription for choosing a transformed harmonic-oscillator (THO) basis for use in configuration-space Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations is presented. The new HFB+ THO framework that follows accurately reproduces the results of coordinate-space HFB calculations for spherical nuclei, including those that are weakly bound. Furthermore, it is fully automated, facilitating its use in systematic investigations of large sets of nuclei throughout the periodic table. As a first application, we have carried out calculations using the Skyrme force SLy4 and volume pairing, with exact particle-number projection following application of the Lipkin-Nogami prescription. Calculations were performed for all even-even nuclei from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line having proton numbers Z= 2, 4,\u2026, 108 and neutron numbers N= 2, 4,\u2026, 188. We focus on nuclei near the neutron drip line and find that there \u2026",
                "We describe the elastic scattering of weakly interacting dark matter particles from nuclei, with laboratory detection in mind. We focus on the lightest neutralino (a neutral fermion predicted by supersymmetry) as a likely candidate and discuss the physics needed to calculate its elastic scattering cross section and interpret experimental results. Particular emphasis is placed on a proper description of the structure of the proposed detector nuclei. We include a brief discussion of expected count rates in some detectors.",

                "We examine isovector and isoscalar neutron-proton correlations in an exactly solvable model based on the algebra SO (8). We look particularly closely at Gamow-Teller strength and double \u03b2 decay, both to isolate the effects of the two kinds of pairing and to test two approximation schemes: the renormalized neutron-proton quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) and generalized BCS theory. When isoscalar pairing correlations become strong enough a phase transition occurs and the dependence of the Gamow-Teller \u03b2+ strength on isospin changes in a dramatic and unfamiliar way, actually increasing as neutrons are added to an N= Z core. Renormalization eliminates the well-known instabilities that plague the QRPA as the phase transition is approached, but only by unnaturally suppressing the isoscalar correlations. Generalized BCS theory, on the other hand, reproduces the Gamow-Teller strength \u2026",
                "We introduce a local-scaling point transformation to allow for modifying the asymptotic properties of the deformed three-dimensional Cartesian harmonic oscillator wave functions. The resulting single-particle bases are very well suited for solving the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations for deformed drip-line nuclei. We then present results of self-consistent calculations performed for the Mg isotopes and for light nuclei located near the two-neutron drip line. The results suggest that for all even-even elements with Z= 10\u201318 the most weakly bound nucleus has an oblate ground-state shape.",

                "Neutron-proton pairing correlations are studied within the context of two solvable models, one based on the algebra SO (5) and the other on the algebra SO (8). In both of these models, particles interact in L= 0 pairs only. Boson-mapping techniques are applied to these models and shown to provide a convenient methodological tool both for solving such problems and for gaining useful insight into general features of pairing. We first focus on the SO (5) model, which involves generalized T= 1 pairing. Neither boson mean-field methods nor fermion-pair approximations are able to describe in detail neutron-proton pairing in this model. The analysis suggests, however, that the boson Hamiltonian obtained from a mapping of the fermion Hamiltonian contains a pairing force between bosons, pointing to the importance of boson-boson (or equivalently four-fermion) correlations with isospin T= 0 and spin S= 0.
