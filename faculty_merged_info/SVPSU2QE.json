                "Quasiparticle gaps, self-energy corrections, exciton Coulomb energies, and optical gaps in Si quantum dots are calculated from first principles using a real-space pseudopotential method. The calculations are performed on hydrogen-passivated spherical Si clusters with diameters up to 27.2 \u212b (\u223c 800 Si and H atoms). It is shown that (i) the self-energy correction in quantum dots is enhanced substantially compared to bulk, and is not size independent as implicitly assumed in all semiempirical calculations, and (ii) quantum confinement and reduced electronic screening result in appreciable excitonic Coulomb energies. Calculated optical gaps are in very good agreement with absorption data.",
                "The structural stability and electronic properties of the ternary intermetallic compounds NiSnM (M= Ti, Zr, Hf) and the closely related Heusler compounds Ni 2 SnM are discussed using the results of ab initio pseudopotential total-energy and band-structure calculations performed with a plane-wave basis set using the conjugate gradients algorithm. The results characterize the lowest-energy phase of NiSnM compounds, with a SnM rocksalt structure sublattice, as narrow-gap semiconductors with indirect gaps near 0.5 eV, while the Ni 2 SnM compounds are described as normal metals. Two other atomic arrangements for NiSnM in the MgAgAs structure type result in energetically unfavorable compounds that are metallic. The gap formation in the lowest-energy structure of NiSnZr and relative stability of the three atomic arrangements are investigated within a tight-binding framework and by considering the \u2026",
                "Polarizabilities of small Si n, Ge n (n\u2264 10), and Ga n As m (n+ m\u2264 8) clusters are calculated using the higher-order finite-difference pseudopotential method in real space. We find the polarizabilities of the clusters considered to be higher than the value estimated from the \u201chard sphere\u201d model using the bulk static dielectric constant. The computed polarizabilities per atom tend to decrease with increasing the cluster size. This trend resembles the case of metallic clusters, for which the bulk limit is approached from above, and confirms the \u201cmetalliclike\u201d nature of small semiconductor clusters.",
                "The optical absorption spectra of Si n H m nanoclusters up to\u223c 250 atoms are computed using a linear response theory within the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA). The TDLDA formalism allows the electronic screening and correlation effects, which determine exciton binding energies, to be naturally incorporated within an ab initio framework. We find the calculated excitation energies and optical absorption gaps to be in good agreement with experiment in the limit of both small and large clusters. The TDLDA absorption spectra exhibit substantial blueshifts with respect to the spectra obtained within the time-independent local density approximation.",
                "We implement the linear response theory within the time-dependent local density-functional formalism (TDLDA) to calculate excitation energies and photoabsorption spectra of atoms and clusters. The calculated ab initio spectra are in very good agreement with experiment. Along with the exact TDLDA formalism, we consider several approximate expressions for the electronic transition energies. The analysis of the spectra calculated with different levels of approximation indicates the important role of the collective electronic excitations in atoms and clusters.",
                "Electronic and structural calculations for atomic clusters present many challenges for traditional theoretical methods. While the computational framework for ground-state properties of clusters is relatively well established, calculations for excited states remain difficult. In this paper we implement a linear-response theory within the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) and apply this technique to calculate excitation energies and optical absorption spectra for a variety of systems ranging from single atoms to semiconductor quantum dots up to several hundred atoms in size. The TDLDA formalism represents a fully ab initio formalism for excited states that avoids many of the drawbacks associated with empirical or semiempirical methods. Compared to other ab initio techniques for excited states, the TDLDA method requires considerably less computational effort and can be applied to much larger systems \u2026",
                "Static polarizabilities and optical absorption spectra for the ground state structures of gold clusters (Au n, n= 2\u201314 and 20) are investigated from first principles within static and time-dependent density functional theory. The static polarizabilities of clusters with less than 14 atoms generally increase as a function of size modulated by even-odd oscillations. The polarizabilities of Au 14 and Au 20 are noticeably lower due to the shape transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional structures at n= 14. The analyses of the optical absorption spectra calculated within the time-dependent local density approximation indicate that the d electrons in Au n clusters are significantly more involved in low-energy transitions and give rise to more quenched oscillator strengths (by screening the s electrons) than in Ag n clusters. These stronger effects of the d electrons in the optical properties of Au n are due to the larger degree \u2026",
                "Static polarizabilities and optical absorption spectra of ground state structures of Ag n clusters (n= 2\u20138) are investigated from first principles within static and time-dependent density functional theory. The static polarizabilities of the clusters with less than 7 atoms exhibit even-odd oscillations. The polarizabilities of Ag 7 and Ag 8 are very close and noticeably lower. This change in the behavior of the static polarizability is correlated with the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional structures at n= 7. The optical spectra calculated within the time-dependent local density approximation indicate sharp excitations in the 3\u20135 eV region. These are associated mainly with s electrons, although d electrons also affect the spectra by quenching the oscillator strengths through screening of the s electrons and by getting partially involved in the excitations. The calculated optical spectra are in good agreement with the \u2026",
                "The structural energetics and diffusion mechanisms of the two most important point defects in rutile Ti O 2, the oxygen vacancy (V O) and the titanium interstitial (Ti I), are examined using the ab initio pseudopotential total-energy method. The two defects are found to be somewhat competitive in energy, with V O being more favorable in a larger range of the stoichiometry. The Ti I, on the other hand, is shown to be the major diffusive species, since its low migration barrier is significantly smaller (by\u223c 1 eV) compared to that of V O. The diffusion mechanisms of Ti I parallel and perpendicular to the crystal c axis are found to be different with a surprisingly larger barrier along the more open [001] direction, which was originally thought to be the easier channel for Ti self-diffusion. These theoretical findings are in excellent quantitative agreement with existing experimental data.",
                "We have obtained photoelectron spectra (PES) for silicon cluster anions with up to 20 atoms. Efficient cooling of species in the source has allowed us to resolve multiple features in the PES for all sizes studied. Spectra for an extensive set of low-energy Si n\u2212 isomers found by a global search have been simulated using density functional theory and pseudopotentials. Except for n= 12, calculations for Si n\u2212 ground states agree with the measurements. This does not hold for other plausible geometries. Hence PES data validate the tricapped trigonal prism morphologies for medium-sized Si clusters."
