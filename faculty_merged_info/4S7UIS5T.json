                "The two-nucleon and nuclear matter problems are solved by matrix inversion in momentum space. Direct matrix inversion of the Lippman-Schwinger and Brueckner equations is shown to be useful for general nuclear potentials including ones that are local, nonlocal, weak, strong, central, or noncentral. This flexibility is employed to study the relationship between nuclear saturation and the smoothness of the two-nucleon interaction.Five potentials are considered that give approximately equivalent phase shifts but differ in their smoothness. Two examples of smooth potentials with very weak nonlocal tensor terms are given. The potentials are classified according to their smoothness by calculating the wave function defect and the wound integral for each case.The binding energy of nuclear matter is calculated for each potential using the effective mass and angle-averaged Pauli operator approximations.

                "An effective potential is presented which matches S, P, and D-wave nucleon-nucleon phase parameters up to 320 MeV without generating the usual strong, short-range correlations. A suitably defined set of separable potentials, including a noncentral force and having small off-energy-shell matrix elements, is employed to produce smooth two-body wave functions. As a preliminary theoretical test of this effective interaction and of the applicability of perturbation theory, the average energy per particle, the single particle potential, and the symmetry energy of infinite nuclear matter have been computed. A saturation of nuclear matter is found in first order at a Fermi momentum of k F= 1.6 F\u2212 1 with an average energy per particle of\u2212 8 MeV; second order contributions move the minimum to k F= 1.8 F\u2212 1 with an average energy per particle of\u2212 14.1 MeV. This saturation is characterized by significant P-wave contributions. A \u2026",
                "The number and type of measurements needed to ascertain the amplitudes for pseudoscalar meson photoproduction are analyzed in this paper. It is found that eight carefully selected measurements can determine the four transversity amplitudes without discrete ambiguities. That number of measurements is one less than previously believed. We approach this problem in two distinct ways:(1) solving for the amplitude magnitudes and phases directly, and (2) using a bilinear helicity product formulation to map an algebra of measurements over to the well-known algebra of the 4\u00d7 4 gamma matrices. It is shown that the latter method leads to an alternate proof that eight carefully chosen experiments suffice for determining the transversity amplitudes completely. In addition, Fierz transformations of the gamma matrices are used to develop useful linear and nonlinear relationships between the spin observables. These \u2026",
                "The general conditions under which the quadratic, uniform and monotonic convergence in the quasilinearization method of solving nonlinear ordinary differential equations could be proved are formulated and elaborated. The generalization of the proof to partial differential equations is straight forward. The method, whose mathematical basis in physics was discussed recently by one of the present authors (VBM), approximates the solution of a nonlinear differential equation by treating the nonlinear terms as a perturbation about the linear ones, and unlike perturbation theories is not based on the existence of some kind of a small parameter.It is shown that the quasilinearization method gives excellent results when applied to different nonlinear ordinary differential equations in physics, such as the Blasius, Duffing, Lane\u2013Emden and Thomas\u2013Fermi equations. The first few quasilinear iterations already provide \u2026"

                "Frank Tabakin Professor Emeritus 33 Hubbard Street (413) 637-0783 tabakin@pitt.edu Spin observables in medium energy electromagnetic strong (hadron) reactions Many experiments at Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB), which provides an intense beam of 6 GeV electrons, involve polarized photons, polarized protons, and polarized targets. Precision studies of the electromagnetic production of (spin 0, 1 and 2) mesons are underway. By studying the spin characteristics of these reactions, we probe the underlying strong interaction dynamics and its relationship to basic QCD ideas. Predictions are made and subject to experimental tests. The excited states of nucleons (neutrons and protons) are examined, which is the subject called hadron spectroscopy.   Quantum Computing As a \"spin\u2013off\" of the above studies of spin observables using density matrix methods, I have initiated a research program on quantum computing (QC) and information. \" QDENSITY, \" a Mathematica simulation of the basic QC teleportation, Grover's search, and Shor's factorization algorithims has been published. A large scale parallel supercomputer QC simulation (called QCMPI) based on various density matrix evolution models was published and is available on the web. \u00a0In 2010, an updated version of \" QDENSITY, \" \u00a0called QCWAVE, was completed. QCWAVE includes a multiverse approach to the affect of noise on quantum algorithms and includes simulation of quantum error correction, using parallel computing features of Mathematica 7.0\/8.0. \u00a0It is available at http:\/\/www.pitt.edu\/~tabakin\/QW . In 2016, QDENSITY\/QCWAVE was extended to qutrit and hybrid qubit\/qutrit systems. \u00a0A paper \"Model Dynamics for Quantum Computing\" was published in\u00a0Annals of Physics Volume 383,\u00a0August 2017, Pages 33-78. \u00a0A \u00a0follow-up study of CNOT gate dynamics\u00a0is being prepared.   Numerical methods for solving nonlinear physics problems In this collaboration with Victor Mandelzweig (Hebrew University, Israel), methods for solving nonlinear problems in Physics have been developed and applied to several fields of Physics. The methods we have developed combine a quasilinearization technique combined with using a wavelet basis for solving particularly difficult equations. In addition to electromagnetic interactions, over the years I have studied strong interactions, the nuclear many\u2013body problem, proton\u2013antiproton reactions, and a variety of other mesonic and nucleon interactions. Numerous PhD thesis have been written on these subjects under my supervision.
