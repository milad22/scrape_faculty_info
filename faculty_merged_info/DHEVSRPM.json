                "Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) gate the only conduits for nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotes. Their gate is formed by nucleoporins containing large intrinsically disordered domains with multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). In combination, these are hypothesized to form a structurally and chemically homogeneous network of random coils at the NPC center, which sorts macromolecules by size and hydrophobicity. Instead, we found that FG domains are structurally and chemically heterogeneous. They adopt distinct categories of intrinsically disordered structures in non-random distributions. Some adopt globular, collapsed coil configurations and are characterized by a low charge content. Others are highly charged and adopt more dynamic, extended coil conformations. Interestingly, several FG nucleoporins feature both types of structures in a bimodal distribution along their polypeptide \u2026",
                "Controllable biaxial and uniaxial nanowrinkles (see figure) are fabricated by a simple two\u2010step approach\u2014metal deposition and subsequent heating\u2014based on shape memory polymer (prestressed polystyrene) sheets. The wavelengths of the wrinkles can be tuned by controlling the thickness of deposited metal. The ready integration of the nanowrinkles into microchannels and their effectiveness in surface enhanced sensing is demonstrated.",
                "A motile cell, when stimulated, shows a dramatic increase in the activity of its membrane, manifested by the appearance of dynamic membrane structures such as lamellipodia, filopodia, and membrane ruffles. The external stimulus turns on membrane bound activators, like Cdc42 and PIP2, which cause increased branching and polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in their vicinity leading to a local protrusive force on the membrane. The emergence of the complex membrane structures is a result of the coupling between the dynamics of the membrane, the activators, and the protrusive forces. We present a simple model that treats the dynamics of a membrane under the action of actin polymerization forces that depend on the local density of freely diffusing activators on the membrane. We show that, depending on the spontaneous membrane curvature associated with the activators, the resulting membrane motion \u2026",
                "Although bacterial cells are known to experience large forces from osmotic pressure differences and their local microenvironment, quantitative measurements of the mechanical properties of growing bacterial cells have been limited. We provide an experimental approach and theoretical framework for measuring the mechanical properties of live bacteria. We encapsulated bacteria in agarose with a user\u2010defined stiffness, measured the growth rate of individual cells and fit data to a thin\u2010shell mechanical model to extract the effective longitudinal Young's modulus of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli (50\u2013150\u2003MPa), Bacillus subtilis (100\u2013200\u2003MPa) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100\u2013200\u2003MPa). Our data provide estimates of cell wall stiffness similar to values obtained via the more labour\u2010intensive technique of atomic force microscopy. To address physiological perturbations that produce changes in cellular \u2026",

Using this substrate, the functional alignment of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes is demonstrated.",
                "Classical particles driven through periodically modulated potential energy landscapes are predicted to follow a devil\u2019s staircase hierarchy of commensurate trajectories depending on the orientation of the driving force. Recent experiments on colloidal spheres flowing through arrays of optical traps do indeed reveal such a hierarchy, but not with the predicted structure. The microscopic trajectories, moreover, appear to be random, with commensurability emerging only in a statistical sense. We introduce an idealized model for periodically modulated transport in the presence of randomness that captures both the structure and statistics of such statistically locked-in states.",
                "We investigate the performance of cylindrical luminescent solar concentrators (CLSCs) with near-infrared lead sulfide quantum dots (QDs) in the active region. We fabricate solid and hollow cylinders from a composite of QDs in polymethylmethacrylate, prepared by radical polymerization, and characterize sample homogeneity and optical properties using spectroscopic techniques. We additionally measure photo-stability and photocurrent outputs under both laboratory and external ambient conditions. The experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations which demonstrate that the hollow CLSCs have higher absorption of incident radiation and lower self-absorption compared to solid cylindrical and planar geometries with similar geometric factors, resulting in a higher optical efficiency.",
                "The bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ is a GTPase that is thought to provide mechanical constriction force via an unidentified mechanism. Purified FtsZ polymerizes into filaments with varying structures in vitro: while GTP-bound FtsZ assembles into straight or gently curved filaments, GDP-bound FtsZ forms highly curved filaments, prompting the hypothesis that a difference in the inherent curvature of FtsZ filaments provides mechanical force. However, no nucleotide-dependent structural transition of FtsZ monomers has been observed to support this force generation model. Here, we present a series of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations probing the effects of nucleotide binding on the structure of an FtsZ dimer. We found that the FtsZ-dimer structure is dependent on nucleotide-binding state. While a GTP-bound FtsZ dimer retained a firm monomer-monomer contact, a GDP-bound FtsZ dimer lost some of the \u2026",
                "We study the effect of the crowded environments on the translocation of a polymer through a pore in a membrane. By systematically treating the entropic penalty due to crowding, we show that the translocation dynamics are significantly altered, leading to novel scaling behaviors of the translocation time. We also observe new and qualitatively different translocation regimes depending upon the extent of crowding, transmembrane chemical potential asymmetry, and polymer length.",
                "The fractal dimension, chemical distance, and finally the effect of an applied electric field on the transport within the interpenetrating network of poly (3\u2010hexylthiophene)\/fullerene bulk heterojunction materials are calculated. According to simulations, charge carriers travel along a pathway~ 4 times longer than the regular Euclidean distance. In an applied electric field, the drift speed of charged carriers is reduced because of field\u2010induced trapping on the tortuous network."
