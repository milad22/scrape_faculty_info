                "Nayeli Zuniga-Hansen Instructor Ph.D., 2013 - Southern\u00a0Illinois University Carbondale 362 Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-0019-Office zunigahansen@lsu.edu Surface and chemical physics My particular focus are computational studies on the kinetics of adsorption and desorption\n                  from crystalline and disordered arrays; kinetic compensation effect due to the presence\n                  of molecular interactions, changes in surface morphology and\/or multiple chemical\n                  species. Teaching Statement Physics is a subject which is best learned by balancing good instruction with active\n                  learning. My teaching experience includes undergraduate and graduate level courses,\n                  laboratories, and private tutoring. Lecturing and providing an introduction in the\n                  lab have taught me the importance of being well prepared for class as an instructor.\n                  However, it is my experience as a student and as a private tutor that has taught me\n                  the importance of active learning. Physics requires problem solving abilities that\n                  can only be acquired through constant practice. It is not enough to observe someone\n                  else solve a problem in class, in order to learn, the students must get involved in\n                  problem solving themselves, while lecture provides an opportunity to reinforce concepts."
