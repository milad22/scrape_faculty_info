                "Self-localized nonlinear excitations (solitons, polarons, and bipolarons) are fundamental and inherent features of quasi-one-dimensional conducting polymers. Their signatures are evident in many aspects of the physical and chemical properties of this growing class of novel materials. As a result, these polymers represent an opportunity for exploring the novel phenomena associated with topological solitons and their linear confinement which results from weakly lifting the ground-state degeneracy. The authors review the theoretical models that have been developed to describe the physics of polyacetylene and related conducting polymers and summarize the relevant experimental results obtained for these materials. An attempt is made to assess the validity of the soliton model of polyacetylene and its generalization to related systems in which the ground-state degeneracy has been lifted.",
                "THE superconducting state of a metal is characterized by a complex order parameter with an amplitude and a phase. In the BCS-Eliashberg mean-field theory1, which is a very good approximation for conventional metals, the phase of the order parameter is un-important for determining the value of the transition temperature T c and the change of many physical properties brought about by the transition. Here we argue that superconductors with low super-conducting carrier density (such as the organic and high-T c oxide superconductors) are characterized by a relatively small phase'stiffness9 and poor screening, both of which imply a significantly larger role for phase fluctuations. As a consequence, in these mat-erials the transition to the superconducting state may not display typical mean-field behaviour, and phase fluctuations, both classical and quantum, may have a significant influence on low-temperature \u2026",
                "This article discusses fluctuating order in a quantum disordered phase proximate to a quantum critical point, with particular emphasis on fluctuating stripe order. Optimal strategies are derived for extracting information concerning such local order from experiments, with emphasis on neutron scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy. These ideas are tested by application to two model systems\u2014an exactly solvable one-dimensional (1D) electron gas with an impurity, and a weakly interacting 2D electron gas. Experiments on the cuprate high-temperature superconductors which can be analyzed using these strategies are extensively reviewed. The authors adduce evidence that stripe correlations are widespread in the cuprates. They compare and contrast the advantages of two limiting perspectives on the high-temperature superconductor: weak coupling, in which correlation effects are treated as a perturbation on \u2026",
                "The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides in 1986 triggered a huge amount of innovative scientific inquiry. In the almost three decades since, much has been learned about the novel forms of quantum matter that are exhibited in these strongly correlated electron systems. A qualitative understanding of the nature of the superconducting state itself has been achieved. However, unresolved issues include the astonishing complexity of the phase diagram, the unprecedented prominence of various forms of collective fluctuations, and the simplicity and insensitivity to material details of the \u2018normal\u2019state at elevated temperatures.",
                "The character of the ground state of an antiferromagnetic insulator is fundamentally altered following addition of even a small amount of charge 1. The added charge is concentrated into domain walls across which a \u03c0 phase shift in the spin correlations of the host material is induced. In two dimensions, these domain walls are \u2018stripes\u2019 which can be insulating 2, 3 or conducting 4, 5, 6\u2014that is, metallic \u2018rivers\u2019 with their own low-energy degrees of freedom. However, in arrays of one-dimensional metals, which occur in materials such as organic conductors 7, interactions between stripes typically drive a transition to an insulating ordered charge-density-wave (CDW) state at low temperatures. Here it is shown that such a transition is eliminated if the zero-point energy of transverse stripe fluctuations is sufficiently large compared tothe CDW coupling between stripes. As a consequence, there should exist electronic \u2026"

                "Steven Kivelson Professor of Physics RESEARCH INTERESTS: How do the interactions between the vastly many electrons in solids produce the emergent phenomena we recognize as the macroscopic behavior of the materials we encounter in everyday life, and in the exotic materials and devices we engineer in the laboratory? The central source of intellectual vitality and practical importance of condensed matter physics is the richness and diversity of behaviors exhibited by strongly interacting systems with many degrees of freedom, ranging from the collective behavior of neurons in the brain to the collective condensation of Cooper pairs that produce the macroscopic quantum phenomena associated with superconducting order. The main thrust of the research carried out by Professor Kivelson is the search for theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors of interacting electrons (i.e., new states of matter)as well as new regimes of parameters in which familiar states of matter behave in new and different ways. In particular, he seeks to explore; qualitatively...the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.

A., Sun, X. Q. 2020 124 (16) : 167601 In the context of recent experimental observations of an unexpectedly large thermal Hall conductivity, \u03ba_{H}, in insulating La_{2}CuO_{4} (LCO) and SrTiO_{3} (STO), we theoretically explore conditions under which acoustic phonons can give rise to such a large \u03ba_{H}. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to \u03ba_{H} are large in proportion to the dielectric constant, \u03b5, and the \"flexoelectric\" coupling, F. While the intrinsic contribution is still orders of magnitude smaller than the observed effect, an extrinsic contribution proportional to the phonon mean-free path appears likely to account for the observations, at least in STO. We predict a larger intrinsic \u03ba_{H} in certain insulating perovskites.

V., Rosenberg, E. W., Hristov, A. T., Berg, E., Fernandes, R. M., Fisher, I. R., Kivelson, S. A. 114 (51) : 13430\u201334 The paradigmatic example of a continuous quantum phase transition is the transverse field Ising ferromagnet. In contrast to classical critical systems, whose properties depend only on symmetry and the dimension of space, the nature of a quantum phase transition also depends on the dynamics. In the transverse field Ising model, the order parameter is not conserved, and increasing the transverse field enhances quantum fluctuations until they become strong enough to restore the symmetry of the ground state. Ising pseudospins can represent the order parameter of any system with a twofold degenerate broken-symmetry phase, including electronic nematic order associated with spontaneous point-group symmetry breaking. Here, we show for the representative example of orbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet that an orthogonal strain or a perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of the transverse field, thereby providing a practical route for tuning appropriate materials to a quantum critical point. While the transverse fields are conjugate to seemingly unrelated order parameters, their nontrivial commutation relations with the nematic order parameter, which can be represented by a Berry-phase term in an effective field theory, intrinsically intertwine the different order parameters.

The nematic fluctuations induce superconductivity with a broad dome in the superconducting [Formula: see text] enclosing the nematic quantum critical point. For temperatures above [Formula: see text], we see strikingly non-Fermi liquid behavior, including a \"nodal-antinodal dichotomy\" reminiscent of that seen in several transition metal oxides. In addition, the critical fluctuations have a strong effect on the low-frequency optical conductivity, resulting in behavior consistent with \"bad metal\" phenomenology.

A., Kao, C., Zhu, D., Lee, J. 113 (51) : 14645-14650 The existence of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in cuprate superconductors has now been established. However, the nature of the CDW ground state has remained uncertain because disorder and the presence of superconductivity typically limit the CDW correlation lengths to only a dozen unit cells or less. Here we explore the field-induced 3D CDW correlations in extremely pure detwinned crystals of YBa2Cu3O2 (YBCO) ortho-II and ortho-VIII at magnetic fields in excess of the resistive upper critical field ([Formula: see text]) where superconductivity is heavily suppressed. We observe that the 3D CDW is unidirectional and possesses a long in-plane correlation length as well as significant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes. It is significant that we observe only a single sharply defined transition at a critical field proportional to [Formula: see text], given that the field range used in this investigation overlaps with other high-field experiments including quantum oscillation measurements. The correlation volume is at least two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the zero-field CDW. This is by far the largest CDW correlation volume observed in any cuprate crystal and so is presumably representative of the high-field ground state of an \"ideal\" disorder-free cuprate.

C., Kivelson, S. A., Fisher, I. R. 352 (6288) : 958-962 A key actor in the conventional theory of superconductivity is the induced interaction between electrons mediated by the exchange of virtual collective fluctuations (phonons in the case of conventional s-wave superconductors). Other collective modes that can play the same role, especially spin fluctuations, have been widely discussed in the context of high-temperature and heavy Fermion superconductors. The strength of such collective fluctuations is measured by the associated susceptibility. Here we use differential elastoresistance measurements from five optimally doped iron-based superconductors to show that divergent nematic susceptibility appears to be a generic feature in the optimal doping regime of these materials. This observation motivates consideration of the effects of nematic fluctuations on the superconducting pairing interaction in this family of compounds and possibly beyond.

We also highlight a profound analogy between the H-SIT and quantum-Hall liquid-to-insulator transitions (QHIT).

P., Shen, Z., Kao, C., Lee, W., Zhu, D., Lee, J. 350 (6263) : 949-952 Charge density wave (CDW) correlations have been shown to universally exist in cuprate superconductors. However, their nature at high fields inferred from nuclear magnetic resonance is distinct from that measured with x-ray scattering at zero and low fields. We combined a pulsed magnet with an x-ray free-electron laser to characterize the CDW in YBa2Cu3O6.67 via x-ray scattering in fields of up to 28 tesla. While the zero-field CDW order, which develops at temperatures below ~150 kelvin, is essentially two dimensional, at lower temperature and beyond 15 tesla, another three-dimensionally ordered CDW emerges. The field-induced CDW appears around the zero-field superconducting transition temperature; in contrast, the incommensurate in-plane ordering vector is field-independent. This implies that the two forms of CDW and high-temperature superconductivity are intimately linked.

In particular, the pseudogap regime of the phase diagram exhibits a variety of mysterious emergent behaviors. In the last few years, evidence from NMR and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies, as well as from a new generation of X-ray scattering experiments, has accumulated, indicating that a general tendency to short-range-correlated incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) order is \"intertwined\" with the superconductivity in this regime. Additionally, transport, STM, neutron-scattering, and optical experiments have produced evidence--not yet entirely understood--of the existence of an associated pattern of long-range-ordered point-group symmetry breaking with an electron-nematic character. We have carried out a theoretical analysis of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective field theory of a classical incommensurate CDW in the presence of weak quenched disorder. Although the possibilities of a sharp phase transition and long-range CDW order are precluded in such systems, we show that any discrete symmetry-breaking aspect of the charge order--nematicity in the case of the unidirectional (stripe) CDW we consider explicitly--generically survives up to a nonzero critical disorder strength. Such \"vestigial order,\" which is subject to unambiguous macroscopic detection, can serve as an avatar of what would be CDW order in the ideal, zero disorder limit.

A., Kivelson, S. A., Shankar, R., Sondhi, S. L., Spivak, B. Z. 109 (23) We study the structure of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, bogolons, the fermionic excitations of paired superfluids that arise from fermion (BCS) pairing, including neutral superfluids, superconductors, and paired quantum Hall states. The naive construction of a stationary quasiparticle in which the deformation of the pair field is neglected leads to a contradiction: it carries a net electrical current even though it does not move. However, treating the pair field self-consistently resolves this problem: in a neutral superfluid, a dipolar current pattern is associated with the quasiparticle for which the total current vanishes. When Maxwell electrodynamics is included, as appropriate to a superconductor, this pattern is confined over a penetration depth. For paired quantum Hall states of composite fermions, the Maxwell term is replaced by a Chern-Simons term, which leads to a dipolar charge distribution and consequently to a dipolar current pattern.

A. 108 (24) We study a generalized quantum hard-core dimer model on the square and honeycomb lattices, allowing for first and second neighbor dimers. At generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson points, the exact ground states can be constructed, and ground-state correlation functions can be equated to those of interacting (1+1)-dimensional Grassmann fields. When the concentration of second neighbor dimers is small, the ground-state correlations are shown to be short ranged corresponding to a (gaped) spin liquid phase. On a 2-torus, the ground states exhibit fourfold topological degeneracy. On a finite cylinder we have found a dramatic even-odd effect depending on the circumference and propose that this can be used as a numerical diagnostic of gapped spin-liquid phases, more generally.

P. 108 (40) : 16549-16553 The behavior of matter near zero temperature continuous phase transitions, or \"quantum critical points\" is a central topic of study in condensed matter physics. In fermionic systems, fundamental questions remain unanswered: the nature of the quantum critical regime is unclear because of the apparent breakdown of the concept of the quasiparticle, a cornerstone of existing theories of strongly interacting metals. Even less is known experimentally about the formation of ordered phases from such a quantum critical \"soup.\" Here, we report a study of the specific heat across the phase diagram of the model system Sr(3)Ru(2)O(7), which features an anomalous phase whose transport properties are consistent with those of an electronic nematic. We show that this phase, which exists at low temperatures in a narrow range of magnetic fields, forms directly from a quantum critical state, and contains more entropy than mean-field calculations predict. Our results suggest that this extra entropy is due to remnant degrees of freedom from the highly entropic state above T(c). The associated quantum critical point, which is \"concealed\" by the nematic phase, separates two Fermi liquids, neither of which has an identifiable spontaneously broken symmetry, but which likely differ in the topology of their Fermi surfaces.

V., Kivelson, S. A., Spivak, B. 106 (25) We develop a hydrodynamic description of the resistivity and magnetoresistance of an electron liquid in a smooth disorder potential. This approach is valid when the electron-electron scattering length is sufficiently short. In a broad range of temperatures, the dissipation is dominated by heat fluxes in the electron fluid, and the resistivity is inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity, \u03ba. This is in striking contrast to the Stokes flow, in which the resistance is independent of \u03ba and proportional to the fluid viscosity. We also identify a new hydrodynamic mechanism of spin magnetoresistance.

L., Spivak, B. Z. 106 (23) The Pfaffian phase in the proximity of a half-filled Landau level is understood to be a p+ip superconductor of composite fermions. We consider the properties of this paired quantum Hall phase when the pairing energy is small, i.e., in the weak-coupling, BCS limit, where the coherence length is much larger than the charge screening length. We find that, as in a type I superconductor, vortices attract so that, upon varying the magnetic field from its magic value at \u03bd=5\/2, the system exhibits Coulomb frustrated phase separation. We propose that the weakly and strongly coupled Pfaffians exemplify a general dichotomy between type I and type II quantum Hall fluids.

We studied the commencement of the pseudogap state at temperature T* using three different techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, polar Kerr effect, and time-resolved reflectivity) on the same optimally doped Bi2201 crystals. We observed the coincident, abrupt onset at T* of a particle-hole asymmetric antinodal gap in the electronic spectrum, a Kerr rotation in the reflected light polarization, and a change in the ultrafast relaxational dynamics, consistent with a phase transition. Upon further cooling, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity begin to grow close to the superconducting transition temperature (T(c)), entangled in an energy-momentum-dependent manner with the preexisting pseudogap features, ushering in a ground state with coexisting orders.

Different fragile Mott insulators are characterized by different nontrivial one-dimensional representations of the crystal point group. We illustrate this new type of insulators with two examples: the d Mott insulator discovered in the checkerboard Hubbard model at half-filling and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki insulator on the square lattice.

The superconductor lacks robust chiral Majorana fermion modes along the boundary. The absence of topologically protected edge modes could explain the surprising absence of experimentally detectable edge currents in this system.

A. 103 (4) We investigate the stability of a quadratic band-crossing point (QBCP) in 2D fermionic systems. At the noninteracting level, we show that a QBCP exists and is topologically stable for a Berry flux +\/-2pi if the point symmetry group has either fourfold or sixfold rotational symmetries. This putative topologically stable free-fermion QBCP is marginally unstable to arbitrarily weak short-range repulsive interactions. We consider both spinless and spin-1\/2 fermions. Four possible ordered states result: a quantum anomalous Hall phase, a quantum spin Hall phase, a nematic phase, and a nematic-spin-nematic phase.

The fermionic excitations, dubbed as \"spinons\", are gapless with a linear dispersion, while the topological \"vison\" excitations are gapped. Moreover, these massless fermionic spinon excitations are topologically stable. Thus, this model is, to the best of our knowledge, the first exactly solvable model of half-integer spins whose ground state is an \"algebraic spin liquid.\" DOI 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.102.217202 Web of Science ID 000266501600048 PubMedID 19519132 d-Wave to s-wave to normal metal transitions in disordered superconductors 5th International Workshop on Electronic Crystals (ECRYS-2008) Spivak, B., Oreto, P., Kivelson, S.

A., Bonn, D. A., Hardy, W. N., Liang, R., Siemons, W., Koster, G., Fejer, M. M., Kapitulnik, A. 100 (12) The polar Kerr effect in the high-T_(c) superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+x was measured at zero magnetic field with high precision using a cyogenic Sagnac fiber interferometer. We observed nonzero Kerr rotations of order approximately 1 microrad appearing near the pseudogap temperature T(*) and marking what appears to be a true phase transition. Anomalous magnetic behavior in magnetic-field training of the effect suggests that time reversal symmetry is already broken above room temperature.

A. 100 (2) We establish a condition for the perturbative stability of zero energy nodal points in the quasiparticle spectrum of superconductors in the presence of coexisting commensurate orders. The nodes are found to be stable if the Hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal followed by a lattice translation. The principle is demonstrated with a few examples. Some experimental implications of various types of assumed order are discussed in the context of the cuprate superconductors.

A. 99 (24) We establish the existence of a chiral spin liquid (CSL) as the exact ground state of the Kitaev model on a decorated honeycomb lattice, which is obtained by replacing each site in the familiar honeycomb lattice with a triangle. This CSL state spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry but preserves other symmetries. There are two topologically distinct CSL's separated by a quantum critical point. Interestingly, vortex excitations in the topologically nontrivial (Chern number +\/-1) CSL obey non-Abelian statistics.

A., Oganesyan, V., Tranquada, J. M., Zhang, S. C. 99 (12) In the stripe-ordered state of a strongly correlated two-dimensional electronic system, under a set of special circumstances, the superconducting condensate, like the magnetic order, can occur at a nonzero wave vector corresponding to a spatial period double that of the charge order. In this case, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a crystal with the special structure of La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4), vanishes identically. We propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the layers recently observed in transport measurements at x = 1\/8.

W., Dahmen, K. A., Fradkin, E., Kivelson, S. A. 96 (9) An electron nematic is a translationally invariant state which spontaneously breaks the discrete rotational symmetry of a host crystal. In a clean square lattice, the electron nematic has two preferred orientations, while dopant disorder favors one or the other orientations locally. In this way, the electron nematic in a host crystal maps to the random field Ising model. Since the electron nematic has anisotropic conductivity, we associate each Ising configuration with a resistor network and use what is known about the random field Ising model to predict new ways to test for local electronic nematic order (nematicity) using noise and hysteresis. In particular, we have uncovered a remarkably robust linear relation between the orientational order and the resistance anisotropy which holds over a wide range of circumstances.

C., Capriotti, L., Scalapino, D. J., Kivelson, S.

Focusing on the superconducting gap, we find patches of what appear to be two different phases in a background of some average gap, one with a relatively small gap and sharp large coherence peaks and one characterized by a large gap with broad weak coherence peaks. We compare these spectra with calculations of the local density of states for a simple phenomenological model in which a 2xi0 x 2xi0 patch with an enhanced or suppressed d-wave gap amplitude is embedded in a region with a uniform average d-wave gap.

In two dimensions (2D), near the critical density, the system is universally unstable to the formation of new intermediate phases, which we call \"electronic microemulsion phases,\" which consist of an intermediate scale mixture of regions of the two competing phases. A corollary is that there can be no direct transition as a function of density from a 2D Wigner crystal to a uniform electron liquid. In 3D, if the strength of the Coulomb interactions exceeds a critical value, no phase separation occurs, while for the weaker Coulomb strength electronic microemulsions are inevitable. This tendency is considerably more pronounced in anisotropic (quasi-2D or quasi-1D) systems, where a devil's staircase of transitions is possible.

A., Zachar, O. 92 (6) We analyze the high-temperature behavior of the susceptibilities towards a number of possible ordered states in the t-J-V model using the high-temperature series expansion. From all diagrams with up to ten edges, reliable results are obtained down to temperatures of order J, or (with some optimism) to J\/2. In the unphysical regime, t J, these susceptibilities are small and decreasing with decreasing temperature; this suggests that the t-J model does not support high-temperature superconductivity. We also find modest evidence of a tendency toward nematic and d-density wave orders.

Y., Kivelson, S. A., Aeppli, G. 88 (25) In certain cuprates, a spin-1 resonance mode is prominent in the magnetic structure measured by neutron scattering. It has been proposed that this mode is responsible for significant features seen in other spectroscopies, such as photoemission and optical absorption, which are sensitive to the charge dynamics, and even that this mode is the boson responsible for \"mediating\" the superconducting pairing. We show that its small (measured) intensity and weak coupling to electron-hole pairs (as deduced from the measured lifetime) disqualifies the resonant mode from either proposed role.

This model is a simple caricature of a striped high temperature superconductor, and is more generally a theoretically controllable system in which the superconducting state emerges from a non-Fermi-liquid normal state. Even in this limit, \" d-wave-like\" order parameter symmetry is natural, but the superconducting state can either have a complete gap in the quasiparticle spectrum, or gapless \"nodal\" quasiparticles. We also find circumstances in which antiferromagnetic order (typically incommensurate) coexists with superconductivity.

This usage is appealingly intuitive but problematically ill-defined: it is vague concerning what qualifies as a large number and what constitutes a qualitative difference. In some contexts, an anthropic definition is offered\u2014something is qualitatively new if it cannot be straightforwardly understood in terms of known properties of the constituents. Among the many shortcomings of this definition, perhaps the most glaring is that it implies that as soon as something is understood it ceases to be emergent; this would mean that understanding the emergent properties of quantum materials (a major focus of this journal) would be oxymoronic. More broadly still, the modifier \u2018emergent\u2019 sometimes appears simply as a colloquial indication that a particular property is of great fundamental importance, and thus newsworthy and highly fundable. Consequently, the term has become somewhat politically charged arising in debates over which subfields of physics are more fundamental; those that are the most reductionist which focus on the physics of the smallest constituents, or those that are least sensitive to microscopic details and thus focus on universal emergent behaviours. Integrating its uses across disciplines, the proper definition of emergence becomes even less clear. In evolutionary biology, emergence often refers to a dynamical process by which new species or new biological structures emerge. In certain philosophical contexts, a form of strong emergence is used to account for the apparent logical gap separating that which is determined by the laws of physics from such basic human characteristics as identity, the existence of a soul and free will. Clearly, no single definition of emergence can encompass all the uses that the word has enjoyed. Here we discuss a sharp definition of the narrow concept of emergence in physics; we give a mathematically precise meaning to the notion of \u2018qualitative difference.\u2019 We propose the following: An emergent behavior of a physical system is a qualitative property that can only occur in the limit that the number of microscopic constituents tends to infinity. To flesh out this definition, let us apply it. The distinguishing features of distinct phases of matter, such as spontaneously broken symmetries or topological order, are surely emergent in the above sense. Given that the microscopic physical laws are reversible, the existence of irreversible processes that lead to an increase in entropy is likewise emergent. Hydrodynamics is explicitly concerned with the behaviour of fluids at scales large compared with all microscopic scales. Consequently, all distinct hydrodynamic behaviours, including laminar flow, turbulence and shock waves, are emergent. Critical phenomena represent another distinct form of emergent properties. On the other hand, merely quantitative distinctions between properties are not, in this sense, emergent. The distinction between highly correlated electronic materials and their weakly correlated brethren is, definitionally, quantitative. There is an emergent property that distinguishes unconventional and conventional superconductors, e.g., those with and without gap nodes on the Fermi surface, respectively. However, by itself, the distinction between high temperature and low temperature superconductors is quantitative, not qualitative. Recognition of the existence of qualitative distinctions between the physical properties of microscopic and macroscopic systems necessarily informs the way we try to understand both aspects. Emergent properties can only be inferred from an understanding of the properties of the microscopic constituents if the analysis is sufficiently subtle to allow for new properties to arise; for instance, spontaneously broken symmetries can only be understood by explicitly exploring asymmetric solutions of the symmetric equations that encapsulate the physics at a microscopic scale. Conversely, the relative insensitivity of the macroscopic behaviour of systems to the precise microscopic interactions is a barrier to making unique inferences concerning the correct microscopic description that gives rise to the observed behaviours. This is why we turn to the brute force experimental approach of CERN rather than relying on very precise low-energy experiments to infer physics at high energies. Another element requiring clarification is what is meant by the \u2018number of microscopic constituents tend[ing] to infinity,\u2019 or in other words \u2018the thermodynamic limit.\u2019 Infinity is an abstraction. Real systems always have a finite number of constituents. When that number is large, it is possible to make increasingly accurate approximate predictions based on reference to the infinite number limit. For instance, a persistent current in a superconducting ring actually has a finite rate of decay. However, since the rate vanishes exponentially with the size of the system, the associated caveat rapidly becomes irrelevant for all practical purposes. It is commonplace for a macroscopic ring to have a decay rate that can be experimentally bounded to be less than one over the life of the universe! Now, let us broaden our discussion so as to explore the wider applicability of our definition in contexts beyond physics. The sometimes-inexplicable behaviour of crowds is often blamed on emergence; a group of angry citizens is more likely than is an individual to lynch a perceived wrongdoer. However, this \u2018new\u2019 collective behaviour is not truly new. Individuals, too, commit murder. A nation\u2019s economy can seem to have a life of its own. Although microeconomics is directly related to decisions made by individuals, macroeconomics is strongly cooperative. In macroeconomics, there are bubbles and trends, and sudden changes in national wealth that are difficult to associate with the actions of one or a few individuals. This brings us to the ultimate emergent phenomena\u2014life and consciousness. Putting aside the possibility of a mystical spark of life, we are left with a peculiar dilemma in applying our definition. Although living organisms contain a vast number of constituent atoms, that number is finite. Here we see the dangers of extending our definition beyond the realm of physics. To preserve our cherished notion that there is a sharp distinction between the animate and the inanimate, it would be necessary to posit that there exists a critical level of microscopic complexity (say around the level characteristic of the largest viruses and the smallest bacteria) at which life begins. If, however, life and consciousness are sharply defined only in the thermodynamic limit, then we are only approximately alive and operationally conscious.
