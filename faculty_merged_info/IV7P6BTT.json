                "The current study characterizes the mechanism by which the Amaranthus spinosus (Amaranthaceae) decreases mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reactions. Anaphylaxis is a typical hypersensitivity Type I reaction, sharing common mechanisms with asthma in its early and late phases. Mast cells are key as effector cells in hypersensitivity Type I reactions. A. spinosus has been traditionally used in the treatment of allergic bronchitis and asthma, but its role in mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reactions has not fully been investigated. This report investigated the potential effects of the ethyl acetate fraction of A. spinosus leaves (EAFAS) against a Compound 48\/80 (potent secretagogue)-induced systemic anaphylactic shock paradigm in a mouse model. In addition, rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) were used in in vitro studies to investigate the effect of EAFAS on Compound 48\/80-induced peritoneal mast cell \u2026"
