                "Bacterial nanowires are extracellular appendages that have been suggested as pathways for electron transport in phylogenetically diverse microorganisms, including dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria and photosynthetic cyanobacteria. However, there has been no evidence presented to demonstrate electron transport along the length of bacterial nanowires. Here we report electron transport measurements along individually addressed bacterial nanowires derived from electron-acceptor\u2013limited cultures of the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Transport along the bacterial nanowires was independently evaluated by two techniques: (i) nanofabricated electrodes patterned on top of individual nanowires, and (ii) conducting probe atomic force microscopy at various points along a single nanowire bridging a metallic electrode and the conductive atomic force microscopy tip. The S \u2026",
                "Bacterial nanowires offer an extracellular electron transport (EET) pathway for linking the respiratory chain of bacteria to external surfaces, including oxidized metals in the environment and engineered electrodes in renewable energy devices. Despite the global, environmental, and technological consequences of this biotic\u2013abiotic interaction, the composition, physiological relevance, and electron transport mechanisms of bacterial nanowires remain unclear. We report, to our knowledge, the first in vivo observations of the formation and respiratory impact of nanowires in the model metal-reducing microbe Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Live fluorescence measurements, immunolabeling, and quantitative gene expression analysis point to S. oneidensis MR-1 nanowires as extensions of the outer membrane and periplasm that include the multiheme cytochromes responsible for EET, rather than pilin-based structures as \u2026",
                "Oxygen consumption in marine sediments is often coupled to the oxidation of sulphide generated by degradation of organic matter in deeper, oxygen-free layers. Geochemical observations have shown that this coupling can be mediated by electric currents carried by unidentified electron transporters across centimetre-wide zones. Here we present evidence that the native conductors are long, filamentous bacteria. They abounded in sediment zones with electric currents and along their length they contained strings with distinct properties in accordance with a function as electron transporters. Living, electrical cables add a new dimension to the understanding of interactions in nature and may find use in technology development.",
                "We introduce a new chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that can be used to selectively deposit materials of many different types. The technique makes use of the plasmon resonance in nanoscale metal structures to produce the local heating necessary to initiate deposition when illuminated by a focused low-power laser. We demonstrate the technique, which we refer to as plasmon-assisted CVD (PACVD), by patterning the spatial deposition of PbO and TiO2 on glass substrates coated with a dispersion of 23 nm gold particles. The morphology of both oxide deposits is consistent with local laser-induced heating of the gold particles by more than 150 \u00b0C. We show that temperature changes of this magnitude are consistent with our analysis of the heat-loss mechanisms. The technique is general and can be used to spatially control the deposition of virtually any material for which a CVD process exists. ",
                "Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria are microorganisms that gain energy by transferring respiratory electrons to extracellular solid-phase electron acceptors. In addition to its importance for physiology and natural environmental processes, this form of metabolism is being investigated for energy conversion and fuel production in bioelectrochemical systems, where microbes are used as biocatalysts at electrodes. One proposed strategy to accomplish this extracellular charge transfer involves forming a conductive pathway to electrodes by incorporating redox components on outer cell membranes and along extracellular appendages known as microbial nanowires within biofilms. To describe extracellular charge transfer in microbial redox chains, we employed a model based on incoherent hopping between sites in the chain and an interfacial treatment of electrochemical interactions with the surrounding electrodes \u2026",
                "The recent discovery of electrically conductive bacterial appendages has significant physiological, ecological, and biotechnological implications, but the mechanism of electron transport in these nanostructures remains unclear. We here report quantitative measurements of transport across bacterial nanowires produced by the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, whose electron transport system is being investigated for renewable energy recovery in microbial fuel cells and bioremediation of heavy metals and radionuclides. The Shewanella nanowires display a surprising nonlinear electrical transport behavior, where the voltage dependence of the conductance reveals peaks indicating discrete energy levels with higher electronic density of states. Our results indicate that the molecular constituents along the Shewanella nanowires possess an intricate electronic structure that plays a \u2026",
                "We report a previously undescribed bacterial behavior termed electrokinesis. This behavior was initially observed as a dramatic increase in cell swimming speed during reduction of solid MnO2 particles by the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The same behavioral response was observed when cells were exposed to small positive applied potentials at the working electrode of a microelectrochemical cell and could be tuned by adjusting the potential on the working electrode. Electrokinesis was found to be different from both chemotaxis and galvanotaxis but was absent in mutants defective in electron transport to solid metal oxides. Using in situ video microscopy and cell tracking algorithms, we have quantified the response for different strains of Shewanella and shown that the response correlates with current-generating capacity in microbial fuel cells. The electrokinetic response \u2026",
                "The study of electrical transport in biomolecular materials is critical to our fundamental understanding of physiology and to the development of practical bioelectronics applications. In this study, we investigated the electronic transport characteristics of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 nanowires by conducting-probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) and by constructing field-effect transistors (FETs) based on individual S. oneidensis nanowires. Here we show that S. oneidensis nanowires exhibit p-type, tunable electronic behavior with a field-effect mobility on the order of 10\u20131 cm2\/(V s), comparable to devices based on synthetic organic semiconductors. This study opens up opportunities to use such bacterial nanowires as a new semiconducting biomaterial for making bioelectronics and to enhance the power output of microbial fuel cells through engineering the interfaces between metallic electrodes and bacterial \u2026",
                "In addition to its natural environmental significance, the process of extracellular electron transfer (EET) can be exploited at electrode interfaces to enable microbial electrochemical technologies for renewable energy recovery, biofuel production, bioremediation, and wastewater treatment. Success in these applications hinges on a better understanding of the electron transfer pathways that link electrochemically active microbes, such as Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, to electrodes. Here, we report electrochemical measurements that reveal both flavin-dependent and flavin-independent EET pathways from S. oneidensis MR-1. Significantly, differential pulse voltammetry captured the redox signatures of both free and cytochrome-bound flavins simultaneously in one experimental system for the first time, allowing us to compare their relative contributions while studying the impact of cell-removal, flavin addition, different \u2026",
                "Bacterial nanowires have garnered recent interest as a proposed extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathway that links the bacterial electron transport chain to solid-phase electron acceptors away from the cell. Recent studies showed that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 produces outer membrane (OM) and periplasmic extensions that contain EET components and hinted at their possible role as bacterial nanowires. However, their fine structure and distribution of cytochrome electron carriers under native conditions remained unclear, making it difficult to evaluate the potential electron transport (ET) mechanism along OM extensions. Here, we report high-resolution images of S. oneidensis OM extensions, using electron cryotomography (ECT). We developed a robust method for fluorescence light microscopy imaging of OM extension growth on electron microscopy grids and used correlative light and electron \u2026"
