                "We present a study of the dynamics of optical contrast agents indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) in an adenocarcinoma rat tumor model. Measurements are conducted with a combined frequency-domain and steady-state optical technique that facilitates rapid measurement of tissue absorption in the 650\u20131000-nm spectral region. Tumors were also imaged by use of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and coregistered with the location of the optical probe. The absolute concentrations of contrast agent, oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and water are measured simultaneously each second for approximately 10 min. The differing tissue uptake kinetics of ICG and MB in these late-stage tumors arise from differences in their effective molecular weights. ICG, because of its binding to plasma proteins, behaves as a macromolecular contrast agent with a low vascular permeability. A \u2026",
                "Structural changes in water molecules are related to physiological, anatomical and pathological properties of tissues. Near infrared (NIR) optical absorption methods are sensitive to water; however, detailed characterization of water in thick tissues is difficult to achieve because subtle spectral shifts can be obscured by multiple light scattering. In the NIR, a water absorption peak is observed around 975 nm. The precise NIR peak's shape and position are highly sensitive to water molecular disposition. We introduce a bound water index (BWI) that quantifies shifts observed in tissue water absorption spectra measured by broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS). DOS quantitatively measures light absorption and scattering spectra and therefore reveals bound water spectral shifts. BWI as a water state index was validated by comparing broadband DOS to magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted MRI \u2026",
                "In this work, a first-of-its-kind fully integrated tri-modality system that combines fluorescence, diffuse optical and x-ray tomography (FT\/DOT\/XCT) into the same setting is presented. The purpose of this system is to perform quantitative fluorescence tomography using multi-modality imaging approach. XCT anatomical information is used as structural priori while optical background heterogeneity information obtained by DOT measurements is used as functional priori. The performance of the hybrid system is evaluated using multi-modality phantoms. In particular, we show that a 2.4 mm diameter fluorescence inclusion located in a heterogeneous medium can be localized accurately with the functional a priori information, although the fluorophore concentration is recovered with 70% error. On the other hand, the fluorophore concentration can be accurately recovered within 8% error only when both DOT optical \u2026",
                "Fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FT) is an emerging molecular imaging technique that can spatially resolve both fluorophore concentration and lifetime parameters. In this study, we investigate the performance of a frequency-domain FT system for small inclusions that are embedded in a heterogeneous background. The results demonstrate that functional and structural a priori information is crucial to be able to recover both parameters with high accuracy. The functional a priori information is defined by the absorption and scattering maps at both excitation and emission wavelengths. Similarly, the boundaries of the small inclusion and different regions in the background are utilized as the structural a priori information. Without a priori information, the fluorophore concentration of a 5 mm inclusion in a 40 mm medium is recovered with 50% error, while the lifetime cannot be recovered at all. On the other hand \u2026",
                "Recently, there has been a great amount of interest in developing multi-modality imaging techniques for oncologic research and clinical studies with the aim of obtaining complementary information and, thus, improving the detection and characterization of tumors. In this present work, the details of a combined MR-diffuse optical imaging system for dual-modality imaging of small animals are given. As a part of this effort, a multi-spectral frequency domain diffuse optical tomography system is integrated with an MRI system. Here, a network analyzer provides the rf modulation signal for the laser diodes and measures the amplitude and the phase of the detected signals. Photomultiplier tubes are utilized to measure low-level signals. The integration of this optical imaging system with the 4T MRI system is realized by incorporating a fiber adaptive interface inside the MR magnet. Coregistration is achieved by a special \u2026",
                "The design and implementation of a multifrequency and multispectral diffuse optical tomography system is described. Four wavelengths are utilized: 665, 785, 808, and 830  nm. The system is based on a network analyzer, which provides rf modulation signals for the laser diodes, as well as measures the amplitude and the phase of the detected signals. Six different modulation frequencies ranging from 110  to  280  MHz are used. The details of instrumentation, calibration, data acquisition, and performance of the system are given. A finite element algorithm is used to solve the diffusion equation, and an inverse solver based on this forward solver is implemented to calculate the absorption and scattering maps from the acquired data. Data acquisition for one wavelength is completed in less than 2.5  min for a single modulation frequency. The measurement repeatability is 0.5% in ac intensity and 0.2  deg in phase. The \u2026",
                "We demonstrate the necessity of functional and structural a priori information for quantitative fluorescence tomography (FT) with phantom studies. Here the functional a priori information is defined as the optical properties of the heterogeneous background that can be measured by a diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system. A CCD-based noncontact hybrid FT\/DOT system that could take measurements at multiple views was built. Multimodality phantoms with multiple compartments were constructed and used in the experiments to mimic a heterogeneous optical background. A 3.6 mm diameter object deeply embedded in a heterogeneous optical background could be localized without any a priori information, but the recovered fluorophore concentration only reached one tenth of the true concentration. On the other hand, the true fluorophore concentration could be recovered when both functional and structural a priori \u2026",
                "A fibre optic experimental arrangement was used to determine the thermo-optic coefficient (dn\/dT) of electron beam deposited titanium dioxide coatings on the cleaved end faces of multimode optical fibres for a wavelength range between 600 and 1050 nm. The temperature-induced change in the index of refraction (n) and extinction coefficient (k) were successfully determined from reflection spectra. Measurements of n and k at various wavelengths for different temperatures enabled the determination of dn\/dT and dk\/dT. It was found that dn\/dT takes different values at different temperature ranges. For example, at 800 nm, dn\/dT was (\u2212 1.77\u00b10.7)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 K\u2212 1, between 18\u00b0 C and 120\u00b0 C, and took a value of (\u2212 3.04\u00b10.7)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 K\u2212 1 between 220\u00b0 C and 325\u00b0 C."
