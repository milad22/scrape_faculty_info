                "Jonathan Heckman Associate Professor High Energy Theory DRL 4N45 Website Associate\u00a0Professor at Penn (2020\u00a0- ) Assistant Professor at Penn (2017 - 2020) Assistant Professor at UNC Chapel Hill (2014 - 2017) Ph.D. Harvard 2009 A.M. Harvard 2005 A.B. Princeton 2004 My research centers on theoretical high energy physics.\u00a0The broad questions my work aims to address are: What is quantum field theory, and what are its limitations as a tool in describing Nature? What are the\u00a0building blocks of matter and spacetime? String theory provides a promising way to address these issues since it is the only known viable approach to unifying quantum theory with gravity. Currently, my efforts are concentrated in three directions: 1) The study of quantum field theory using the extra dimensions of string theory. 2)\u00a0The study of formal and phenomenological aspects of string compactification, and in particular F-theory. 3) Conceptual questions connected with the embedding of field theoretic UV cutoffs in string theory.
