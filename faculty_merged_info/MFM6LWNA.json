                "We present a compact analytic formula for the two-loop six-particle maximally helicity violating remainder function (equivalently, the two-loop lightlike hexagon Wilson loop) in N= 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of the classical polylogarithm functions Li k with cross ratios of momentum twistor invariants as their arguments. In deriving our formula we rely on results from the theory of motives.",
                "These lectures present an elementary discussion of some background material relevant to the problem of de Sitter quantum gravity. The first two lectures discuss the classical geometry of de Sitter space and properties of quantum field theory on de Sitter space, especially the temperature and entropy of de Sitter space. The final lecture contains a pedagogical discussion of the appearance of the conformal group as an asymptotic symmetry group, which is central to the dS\/CFT correspondence. A (previously lacking) derivation of asymptotically de Sitter boundary conditions is also given.",
                "We give a representation of the parity-even part of the planar two-loop six-gluon maximally helicity violating (MHV) amplitude of N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory, in terms of loop-momentum integrals with simple dual conformal properties. We evaluate the integrals numerically in order to test directly the Anastasiou-Bern-Dixon-Kosower\/Bern-Dixon-Smirnov all-loop ansatz for planar MHV amplitudes. We find that the ansatz requires an additive remainder function, in accord with previous indications from strong-coupling and Regge limits. The planar six-gluon amplitude can also be compared with the hexagonal Wilson loop computed by Drummond, Henn, Korchemsky, and Sokatchev in arXiv: 0803.1466. After accounting for differing singularities and other constants independent of the kinematics, we find that the Wilson loop and MHV-amplitude remainders are identical, to within our numerical precision. This result \u2026",
                "We further investigate the procedure for computing tree-level amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory from connected instantons in the B model on P 3| 4, emphasizing that the problem of calculating Feynman diagrams is recast into the problem of finding solutions to a certain set of algebraic equations. We show that the B model correctly reproduces all 6-particle amplitudes, including non-MHV amplitudes with three negative and three positive helicity gluons. As a further check, we also show that n-particle amplitudes obtained from the B model obey a number of properties required of gauge theory, such as parity symmetry (which relates an integral over degree d curves to one over degree n\u2212 d\u2212 2 curves) and the soft and collinear gluon poles.",
                "We construct light-cone gauge superstring field theory in a pp-wave background with Ramond-Ramond flux. The leading term in the interaction Hamiltonian is determined up to an overall function of p+ by requiring closure of the pp-wave superalgebra. The bosonic and fermionic Neumann matrices for this cubic vertex are derived, as is the interaction point operator. We comment on the development of a 1\/\u03bc p+ expansion for these results.",
                "In this paper we study motivic amplitudes\u2014objects which contain all of the essential mathematical content of scattering amplitudes in planar SYM theory in a completely canonical way, free from the ambiguities inherent in any attempt to choose particular functional representatives. We find that the cluster structure on the kinematic configuration space Conf n (\u2119 3) underlies the structure of motivic amplitudes. Specifically, we compute explicitly the coproduct of the two-loop seven-particle MHV motivic amplitude and find that like the previously known six-particle amplitude, it depends only on certain preferred coordinates known in the mathematics literature as cluster-coordinates on Conf n (\u2119 3). We also find intriguing relations between motivic amplitudes and the geometry of generalized associahedrons, to which cluster coordinates have a natural combinatoric connection. For example, the obstruction to \u2026",
                "In type-IIB light-cone superstring field theory, the cubic interaction has two pieces: a delta-functional overlap and an operator inserted at the interaction point. In this paper we extend our earlier work by computing the matrix elements of this operator in the oscillator basis of pp-wave string theory for all \u03bcp+ \u03b1'. By evaluating these matrix elements for large \u03bcp+ \u03b1', we check a recent conjecture relating matrix elements of the light-cone string field theory hamiltonian (with prefactor) to certain three-point functions of BMN operators in the gauge theory. We also make several predictions for gauge theory.",
                "We introduce a method for extracting the cusp anomalous dimension at L loops from four-gluon amplitudes in N= 4 Yang-Mills without evaluating any integrals that depend on the kinematical invariants. We show that the anomalous dimension only receives contributions from the obstructions introduced in [F. Cachazo, M. Spradlin, and A. Volovich, J. High Energy Phys. 07 (2006) 007]. We illustrate this method by extracting the two-and three-loop anomalous dimensions analytically and the four-loop one numerically. The four-loop result was recently guessed to be f (4)=\u2212(4 \u03b6 2 3+ 24 \u03b6 2 \u03b6 4+ 50 \u03b6 6\u2212 4 (1+ r) \u03b6 3 2) with r=\u2212 2 using integrability and string theory arguments in [N. Beisert, B. Eden, and M. Staudacher, J. Stat. Mech.(2007) P021]. Simultaneously, f (4) was computed numerically in [Z. Bern, M. Czakon, LJ Dixon, DA Kosower, and VA Smirnov, Phys. Rev. D 75, 085010 (2007)] from the four-loop amplitude \u2026",
                "Recently it has been proposed that gluon scattering amplitudes in gauge theory can be computed from the D-instanton expansion of the topological B-model on Bbb P 3| 4, although only maximally helicity violating (MHV) amplitudes have so far been obtained from a direct B-model calculation. In this note we compute the simplest non-MHV gluon amplitudes (++---and+-+--) from the B-model as an integral over the moduli space of degree 2 curves in Bbb P 3| 4 and find perfect agreement with Yang-Mills theory.",
                "We apply the dressing method to construct new classical string solutions describing various scattering and bound states of magnons. These solutions carry one, two or three SO (6) charges and correspond to multi-soliton configurations in the generalized sine-Gordon models."
