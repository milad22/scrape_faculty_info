                "Graphene\u2019s success has shown that it is possible to create stable, single and few-atom-thick layers of van der Waals materials, and also that these materials can exhibit fascinating and technologically useful properties. Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface. Finally, we highlight \u2026",
                "Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures of WS 2\/MoS 2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS 2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS 2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS 2 on MoS 2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that \u2026",
                "The isolation of graphene in 2004 from graphite was a defining moment for the \u201cbirth\u201d of a field: two-dimensional (2D) materials. In recent years, there has been a rapidly increasing number of papers focusing on non-graphene layered materials, including transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), because of the new properties and applications that emerge upon 2D confinement. Here, we review significant recent advances and important new developments in 2D materials \u201cbeyond graphene\u201d. We provide insight into the theoretical modeling and understanding of the van der Waals (vdW) forces that hold together the 2D layers in bulk solids, as well as their excitonic properties and growth morphologies. Additionally, we highlight recent breakthroughs in TMD synthesis and characterization and discuss the newest families of 2D materials, including monoelement 2D materials (i.e., silicene, phosphorene, etc.) and \u2026",
                "Individual monolayers of metal dichalcogenides are atomically thin two-dimensional crystals with attractive physical properties different from those of their bulk counterparts. Here we describe the direct synthesis of WS2 monolayers with triangular morphologies and strong room-temperature photoluminescence (PL). The Raman response as well as the luminescence as a function of the number of S\u2013W\u2013S layers is also reported. The PL weakens with increasing number of layers due to a transition from direct band gap in a monolayer to indirect gap in multilayers. The edges of WS2 monolayers exhibit PL signals with extraordinary intensity, around 25 times stronger than that at the platelet\u2019s center. The structure and chemical composition of the platelet edges appear to be critical for PL enhancement.",
                "This account reviews the discovery, synthesis, properties, and the latest research advances of carbon nanotubes developed over the past 12 years. Because of their remarkable electronic and mechanical properties, carbon nanotubes are unique and exciting. The field has been developed rapidly, and the number of publications per year is increasing almost exponentially. Various technological applications are likely to arise using nanotubes for fabrication of flat panel displays, gas storage devices, toxic gas sensors, Li+ batteries, robust and lightweight composites, conducting paints, electronic nanodevices, etc. Further experimental and theoretical research is still necessary so that novel technologies will become a reality in the early twenty-first century.",
                "Carbon nanotubes 1, 2 might be usefully employed in nanometre-scale engineering and electronics. Electrical conductivity measurements on the bulk material 3, 4, on individual multi-walled 5, 6 and single-walled 7 nanotubes and on bundles of single-walled nanotubes 8, 9 have revealed that they may behave as metallic, insulating or semiconducting nanowires, depending on the method of production\u2014which controls the degree of graphitization, the helicity and the diameter. Measurements of Young's modulus show 10 that single nanotubes are stiffer than commercial carbon fibres. Methods commonly used to generate nanotubes\u2014carbon-arc discharge techniques 1, 2, 4, catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbons 11, 12 and condensed-phase electrolysis 13, 14\u2014generally suffer from the drawbacks that polyhedral particles are also formed and that the dimensions of the nanotubes are highly variable. Here we describe \u2026",
                "The Raman scattering of single-and few-layered WS 2 is studied as a function of the number of SWS layers and the excitation wavelength in the visible range (488, 514 and 647 nm). For the three excitation wavelengths used in this study, the frequency of the A 1g (\u0393) phonon mode monotonically decreases with the number of layers. For single-layer WS 2, the 514.5 nm laser excitation generates a second-order Raman resonance involving the longitudinal acoustic mode (LA (M)). This resonance results from a coupling between the electronic band structure and lattice vibrations. First-principles calculations were used to determine the electronic and phonon band structures of single-layer and bulk WS 2. The reduced intensity of the 2LA mode was then computed, as a function of the laser wavelength, from the fourth-order Fermi golden rule. Our observations establish an unambiguous and nondestructive Raman \u2026"
