                "This Letter reports the results from a haloscope search for dark matter axions with masses between 2.66 and 2.81 \u03bc eV. The search excludes the range of axion-photon couplings predicted by plausible models of the invisible axion. This unprecedented sensitivity is achieved by operating a large-volume haloscope at subkelvin temperatures, thereby reducing thermal noise as well as the excess noise from the ultralow-noise superconducting quantum interference device amplifier used for the signal power readout. Ongoing searches will provide nearly definitive tests of the invisible axion model over a wide range of axion masses.",
                "This Letter reports on a cavity haloscope search for dark matter axions in the Galactic halo in the mass range 2.81\u20133.31 \u03bc eV. This search utilizes the combination of a low-noise Josephson parametric amplifier and a large-cavity haloscope to achieve unprecedented sensitivity across this mass range. This search excludes the full range of axion-photon coupling values predicted in benchmark models of the invisible axion that solve the strong C P problem of quantum chromodynamics.",
                "The \u03bc eV axion is a well-motivated extension to the standard model. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) collaboration seeks to discover this particle by looking for the resonant conversion of dark-matter axions to microwave photons in a strong magnetic field. In this Letter, we report results from a pathfinder experiment, the ADMX \u201cSidecar,\u201d which is designed to pave the way for future, higher mass, searches. This testbed experiment lives inside of and operates in tandem with the main ADMX experiment. The Sidecar experiment excludes masses in three widely spaced frequency ranges (4202\u20134249, 5086\u20135799, and 7173\u20137203 MHz). In addition, Sidecar demonstrates the successful use of a piezoelectric actuator for cavity tuning. Finally, this publication is the first to report data measured using both the TM 010 and TM 020 modes.",
                "Axion dark matter haloscopes aim to detect dark matter axions converting to single photons in resonant cavities bathed in a uniform magnetic field. A qubit (two level system) operating as a single microwave photon detector is a viable readout system for such detectors and may offer advantages over the quantum limited amplifiers currently used. When weakly coupled to the detection cavity, the qubit transition frequency is shifted by an amount proportional to the cavity photon number. Through spectroscopy of the qubit, the frequency shift is measured and the cavity occupation number is extracted. At low enough temperatures, this would allow sensitivities exceeding that of the standard quantum limit."
