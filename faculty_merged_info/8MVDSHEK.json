                "Brian C. Tiburzi Assistant Professor City College of New York (212)650-5586 btiburzi@ccny.cuny.edu Additional Website M.S., Ph.D. University of Washington; B.A. Amherst College Theoretical nuclear and particle physics, lattice gauge theory Professor Tiburzi's work is focused in the areas of theoretical nuclear and particle physics, and lattice gauge theory. He seeks to understand features of the strong force: the force that binds quarks and gluons into protons and neutrons, and that ultimately gives rise to the nuclear interaction. His main quantitative tools are effective quantum field theories (chiral perturbation theory, heavy quark effective theory), and numerical field theory simulations using lattice gauge theory. Current interests include aspects of chiral symmetry breaking, and computations of the electroweak properties of the nucleon."
