                "Volatiles are lost from the Earth's mantle to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and crust through a combination of subaerial and submarine volcanic and magmatic activity. These volatiles can be primordial in origin, trapped in the mantle since planetary accretion, produced in situ, or they may be recycled\u2014re-injected into the mantle via material originally at the surface through the subduction process. Quantifying the absolute and relative contributions of these various volatile sources bears fundamental information on a number of issues in the Earth Sciences ranging from the evolution of the atmosphere and hydrosphere to the nature and scale of chemical heterogeneity in the Earth\u2019s mantle. Noble gases have a pivotal role to play in addressing the volatile mass balance between the Earth\u2019s interior and exterior reservoirs. The primordial isotope 3He provides an unambiguous measure of the juvenile volatile flux from the \u2026",

                "The association of anomalous topographic swells and widespread Cenozoic volcanism within the African plate (Hoggar, Tibesti, Darfur, Ethiopian highlands, Kenyan dome) may reflect either the involvement of one, or several, deep mantle plumes, or, alternatively, be attributed to tectonic processes involving only the lithosphere or the shallow asthenosphere. We present here new helium isotopic measurements that, added to existing data, allow us to restrict the spatial extent of a high-3He component (up to 20 Ra) to the Ethiopia\u2013Afar volcanic province, for places where large volumes of Oligocene pre-rift flood basalts and ignimbrites erupted within a short (1\u20132 Ma) time interval. All other investigated African volcanic provinces display MORB-type, and\/or continental lithosphere-like, 3He \/ 4He signatures (7 \u00b1 2 Ra) often modified by a contribution of crustal He.

                "Olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts contained in late Tertiary basalts from Selardalur, northwest Iceland, carry volatiles with the highest helium isotope ratio yet reported for any mantle plume. 3He\/4He ratios measured on three different samples and extracted by stepped crushing in vacuo fall consistently \u02dc37 RA (RA = air 3He\/4He) \u2014 significantly higher than previously reported values for Iceland or Loihi Seamount (see K.A. Farley, E. Neroda [Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 26 (1998) 189\u2013218]). The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic composition of the same sample places it towards the center of the mantle tetrahedron of Hart et al. (S.R. Hart, E.H. Hauri, L.A. Oschmann, J.A. Whitehead [Science 256 (1992) 517\u2013520]) \u2014 in exactly the region predicted for the common mantle endmember based on the convergence of a number of pseudo-linear arrays of ocean island basalts worldwide (E.H.

                "The first comprehensive helium isotope survey of the Andes is reported here. We have sampled geothermal fluids and phyric lava flows from the Southern (svz) and Central (cvz) Volcanic Zones, the volcanically active Pun\u02dca region and the Precordillera, Salta Basin, Longitudinal Valley and the aseismic region between the two volcanic zones. Although the active areas are characterised by significant differences in crustal age and thickness, the svz, cvz and Pun\u02dca are characterised by a wide and overlapping range in 3He\/4He ratios (for fluids and phenocrysts) from predominantly radiogenic values to close to the MORB ratio. The measured ranges in 3He\/4He ratios (R) (reported normalised to the air 3He\/4He\u2014RA) are: svz (0.18 < R\/RA< 6.9); cvz (0.82 < R\/RA< 6.0); and Pun\u02dca (1.8 < R\/RA< 5.4).

                "We report N and He isotopic and relative abundance characteristics of volatiles emitted from two segments of the Central American volcanic arc. In Guatemala, \u03b415N values are positive (i.e., greater than air) and N2\/He ratios are high (up to 25,000). In contrast, Costa Rican N2\/He ratios are low (maximum 1483) and \u03b415N values are negative (minimum \u20133.0 per mil). The results identify shallow hemipelagic sediments, subducted into the Guatemalan mantle, as the transport medium for the heavy N. Mass balance arguments indicate that the subducted N is efficiently cycled to the atmosphere by arc volcanism. Therefore, the subduction zone acts as a \u201cbarrier\u201d to input of sedimentary N to the deeper mantle.",
                "We report 3He\/4He ratios, relative He, Ne, and CO2 abundances as well as \u03b413C values for volatiles from the volcanic output along the Costa Rica and Nicaragua segments of the Central American arc utilising fumaroles, geothermal wells, water springs and bubbling hot springs. CO2\/3He ratios are relatively constant throughout Costa Rica (av. 2.1\u00d71010) and Nicaragua (av. 2.5\u00d71010) and similar to arcs worldwide (\u223c1.5\u00d71010). \u03b413C values range from \u22126.8\u2030 (MORB-like) to \u22120.1\u2030 (similar to marine carbonate (0\u2030)). 3He\/4He ratios are essentially MORB-like (8\u00b11 RA) with some samples showing evidence of crustal He additions \u2013 water spring samples are particularly susceptible to modification. The He\u2013CO2 relationships are consistent with an enhanced input of slab-derived C to magma sources in Nicaragua ((L+S)\/M=16; where L, M and S represent the fraction of CO2 derived from limestone and\/or marine \u2026"
