                "PHOTONIC crystals are artificial structures having a periodic dielectric structure designed to influence the behaviour of photons in much the same way that the crystal structure of a semiconductor affects the properties of electrons 1. In particular, photonic crystals forbid propagation of photons having a certain range of energies (known as a photonic bandgap), a property that could be incorporated in the design of novel optoelectronic devices 2. Following the demonstration of a material with a full photonic bandgap at microwave frequencies 3, there has been considerable progress in the fabrication of three-dimensional photonic crystals with operational wavelengths as short as 1.5 \u03bcm (ref. 4), although the optical properties of such structures are still far from ideal 5. Here we show that, by restricting the geometry of the photonic crystal to two dimensions (in a waveguide configuration), structures with polarization \u2026"
