                "Top Daniel Sheehy Associate Professor of Physics Ph.D., 2001 - University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 210-B Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. 225-578-5852-Office sheehy@lsu.edu Personal Home Page Theoretical Condensed Matter I study the theoretical physics of quantum many-particle systems in which interactions\n                     are qualitatively important and lead to novel behavior. Examples of the systems I\n                     am interested in include Bose-Einstein condensates and paired fermion superfluidity,\n                     that are phenomena from the realm of ultracold atoms, as well as condensed-matter\n                     systems such as graphene (a one-atom thick layer of carbon with interesting electronic\n                     properties), heavy-fermion materials, and high-temperature superconductors.
