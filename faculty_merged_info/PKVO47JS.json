By studying them, Ochoa-Ricoux\u00a0learns\u00a0about the processes and the sources that produce them, both inside and outside our planet.\u00a0Ochoa-Ricoux joined the department of Physics at the University of California Irvine in 2018, on the heels of being a Professor of Physics at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile for 5 years.\u00a0He\u00a0received his undergraduate degree in Physics in Monterrey, Mexico. In 2003, he moved to Caltech where he earned his\u00a0Masters and\u00a0PhD and\u00a0worked in a project\u00a0called MINOS, with\u00a0neutrinos being\u00a0shot underground\u00a0for 735 km\u00a0between Illinois and Minnesota. In 2009, he was awarded the\u00a0prestigious\u00a0Chamberlain Fellowship at Berkeley Lab, where he worked in an experiment that studies neutrinos produced by 6 nuclear reactors in the southeast of China. Since then Ochoa-Ricoux\u00a0has\u00a0continued to study neutrinos produced by nuclear reactors and astrophysical sources,\u00a0most notably as a member of the JUNO experiment in China.\u00a0He has also contributed to the ATLAS\u00a0experiment at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) that studies the proton-proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and he is a member of an international collaboration called LiquidO that is pioneering a new type of neutrino detector. Professor\u00a0Ochoa-Ricoux is the recipient of several awards, including the Springer Thesis Award in 2010, the prize for the Most Promising Scientist at the Doctoral Level awarded by the\u00a0\u201cGreat Minds in STEM\u201d organization in 2012, and the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2016. He was also selected as a young-scientist of the World Economic Forum and has received several awards for teaching.
