                "We investigate the effect of extending the standard MSTW parameterisation of input parton distribution functions (PDFs) using Chebyshev polynomials, rather than the usual expressions which involve a factor of the form (1+\u03f5x 0.5+\u03b3x). We find evidence that four powers in the polynomial are generally sufficient for high precision. Applying this to valence and sea quarks, the gluon already being sufficiently flexible and needing only two powers, we find an improvement in the global fit, but a significant change only in the small-x valence up-quark PDF, u  V . We investigate the effect of also extending, and making more flexible, the \u2018nuclear\u2019 correction to deuteron structure functions. We show that the extended \u2018Chebyshev\u2019 parameterisation results in an improved stability in the deuteron corrections that are required for the best fit to the \u2018global\u2019 data. The resulting PDFs have a \u2026",
                "Interactions between microorganisms and their complex flowing environments are essential in many biological systems. We develop a model for microswimmer dynamics in non-Newtonian Poiseuille flows. We predict that swimmers in shear-thickening (-thinning) fluids migrate upstream more (less) quickly than in Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that viscoelastic normal stress differences reorient swimmers causing them to migrate upstream at the centerline, in contrast to well-known boundary accumulation in quiescent Newtonian fluids. Based on these observations, we suggest a sorting mechanism to select microbes by swimming speed.",
                "One of the principal mechanisms by which surfaces and interfaces affect microbial life is by perturbing the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming. By summing a recursive series of image systems we derive a numerically tractable approximation to the three-dimensional flow fields of a Stokeslet (point force) within a viscous film between a parallel no-slip surface and no-shear interface and, from this Green's function, we compute the flows produced by a force-and torque-free micro-swimmer. We also extend the exact solution of Liron & Mochon (1976) to the film geometry, which demonstrates that the image series gives a satisfactory approximation to the swimmer flow fields if the film is sufficiently thick compared to the swimmer size, and we derive the swimmer flows in the thin-film limit. Concentrating on the thick film case, we find that the dipole moment induces a bias towards swimmer accumulation at the no-slip wall rather than the water-air interface, but that higher-order multipole moments can oppose this. Based on the analytic predictions we propose an experimental method to find the multipole coefficient that induces circular swimming trajectories, allowing one to analytically determine the swimmer's three-dimensional position under a microscope.",
                "We study tracer particle transport due to flows created by a self-propelled microswimmer, such as a swimming bacterium, alga or a microscopic artificial swimmer. Recent theoretical work has shown that as a swimmer moves in the fluid bulk along an infinite straight path, tracer particles far from its path perform closed loops, whereas those close to the swimmer are entrained by its motion. However, in biologically and technologically important cases tracer transport is significantly altered for swimmers that move in a run-and-tumble fashion with a finite persistence length, and\/or in the presence of a free surface or a solid boundary. Here we present a systematic analytical and numerical study exploring the resultant regimes and their crossovers. Our focus is on describing qualitative features of the tracer particle transport and developing quantitative tools for its analysis. Our work is a step towards understanding the ecological effects of flows created by swimming organisms, such as enhanced fluid mixing and biofilm formation."

Our main goals are to understand the\u00a0physics of pathogens\u00a0and the\u00a0collective functionality of intelligent active matter (out of equilibrium). More generally, we aim to bridge\u00a0multi-scale biology with the physics of solids, fluids and information. Besides these basic questions, we also work on\u00a0designing active and adaptive materials, microfluidics for biomedical applications, and developing\u00a0effective strategies to prevent pathogen dispersal. Recent themes include ultra-fast biology and hydrodynamic communication (Nature 2019), pathogen clearance in the airways (Nature Physics 2020), tuning upstream swimming of microrobots (Physical Review Applied 2020), and bacterial contamination dynamics (Nature Communications 2019). This research is both fundamental in nature (e.g. How can an intelligent system arise from the collective dynamics of its basic components?) and directly applied to our society (e.g. What is the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a food supply chain?). Our enthusiasm\u00a0is driven by curiosity and the need for solutions that connect science with the challenges of the world we live in. Please get in touch if you would like to join our team!
