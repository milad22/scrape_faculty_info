                "Previous research has rarely examined teachers\u2019 perceptions of school culture (perceived school culture) and well\u2010being in Hong Kong\u2019s non\u2010profit\u2010making (NPM) and profit\u2010making (PM) kindergartens. Thus, the purpose of this study was twofold: first, it examined the relationships between Hong Kong kindergarten teachers\u2019 perceived school culture and well\u2010being. Second, it compared NPM and PM kindergartens in terms of teachers\u2019 perceived school culture, job satisfaction and mental health complaints. Kindergarten teachers were invited to complete a set of questionnaires including a School Culture Survey, Job Satisfaction Survey and General Health Questionnaire. Results showed that teachers\u2019 perceived school culture correlated positively with their job satisfaction but negatively with mental health complaints. Interestingly, teachers in NPM kindergartens had higher job satisfaction and fewer mental health \u2026",

                "The principal objective of this study was to investigate the predictive power of thinking styles for hardiness\u2014a healthy personality disposition. Four hundred (146 males and 254 females) students from a large, comprehensive university in Shanghai, the People\u2019s Republic of China, responded to the Thinking Styles Inventory-Revised II (Sternberg, Wagner, & Zhang, 2007) and the hardiness scale (Bartone, Ursano, Wright, & Ingraham, 1989). Results showed that after students\u2019 age and gender were controlled for, creativity-generating styles (also known as Type I styles) and a style that allows students to work in collaboration with others (i.e., external style) positively contributed to hardiness, whereas norm-favoring styles (also known as Type II styles) and a style that denotes a lack of discipline and planning (i.e., anarchic style) negatively contributed to hardiness. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to \u2026",

The purpose of study was to address this issue by examining the relationships of teachers\u2019 job satisfaction, self-esteem, and mental health complaints (representing SWB) to their demographic characteristics. 371 in-service teachers participated voluntarily as convenient sample by self-rating on the inventories, including the Job Satisfaction Survey, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, and the General Health Questionaire-12. Results showed that the SWB variables showed significant correlations with the majority of demographic factors: the factors of age, marital status, years of teaching, and rank in school correlated with all SWB variables. Among all demographics, the \u201crank in \u2026",
                "While kindergarten teachers have shown resilience under adverse work environment, scarce empirical research has examined these teachers\u2019 resilient protective factors, namely hardiness and optimism. The study had two aims. First, it examined the correlation relationships among variables of hardiness, optimism, self-esteem, and mental health complaints. Second, it testified the mediating effect of hardiness on optimism. Inservice kindergarten teachers were invited to participate in the study as voluntary convenient samplings. They were asked to complete four inventories anonymously to enhance confidentiality and their willingness to participate. Eventually, 64 out of 104 teachers participated and returned the inventories. Results showed that both hardiness and optimism correlated positively with self-esteem but negatively with mental health complaints. While hardiness mediated the effects of optimism, teachers \u2026",
                "The relationship between curriculum and pedagogy is received less attention by educators. I propose that teachers' pedagogy acts as the mediator in the relationship between curriculum and children's learning outcomes. In particular, teachers' pedagogical styles such as instructional and learning styles are direct reflections of their personality characteristics. In other words, teachers' personality characteristics are implicit factors that contribute to an effective school curriculum. A pilot study shows that most kindergarten teachers are sensing types that prefer details and feel uncomfortable to the changes in school. Implications for early childhood education practitioners to consider the effects of teachers' personality on pedagogy are discussed."
