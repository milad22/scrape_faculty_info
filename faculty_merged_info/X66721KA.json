Recent projects\u00a0include: 1) stringy Born-Infeld electrodynamics - a way to measure the string coupling constant\u00a0by\n                  means of light-deflection observations. 2) Evaporation of quantum-corrected Reissner\u00a0Nordstrom black holes. 3) Non-singular black holes - black holes with regular cores supported\u00a0by nonlinear\n                  EM fields. 4) Accelerated observers and non-thermal vacuum states. 5) loop\u00a0quantum gravity cosmology. 1. \"Charged black hole horizons and QED effects\", Johnathon Thompson and G.M., Phys.\n                  Rev.
