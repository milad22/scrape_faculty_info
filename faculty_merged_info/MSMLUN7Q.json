                "The recent Gaia Data Release 1 of stellar parallaxes provides ample opportunity to find metal-poor main-sequence stars with precise parallaxes. We select 21 such stars with parallax uncertainties better than \u03c3 \u03c0\/\u03c0\u2264 0.10 and accurate abundance determinations suitable for testing metal-poor stellar evolution models and determining the distance to Galactic globular clusters (GCs). A Monte Carlo analysis was used, taking into account uncertainties in the model construction parameters, to generate stellar models and isochrones to fit to the calibration stars. The isochrones that fit the calibration stars best were then used to determine the distances and ages of 22 GCs with metallicities ranging from\u2212 2.4 dex to\u2212 0.7 dex. We find distances with an average uncertainty of 0.15 mag and absolute ages ranging from 10.8 to 13.6 Gyr with an average uncertainty of 1.6 Gyr. Using literature proper motion data, we calculate \u2026",
                "We collected a large data set of field RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) by using catalogs already available in the literature and Gaia DR2. We estimated the iron abundances for a subsample of 2382 fundamental RRLs (\u0394S method: Ca ii K, H\u03b2, H\u03b3, and H\u03b4 lines) for which there are publicly available medium-resolution SDSS-SEGUE spectra. We also included similar estimates available in the literature, ending up with the largest and most homogeneous spectroscopic data set ever collected for RRLs (2903). The metallicity scale was validated by using iron abundances based on high-resolution spectra for a fundamental field RRL (V Ind), for which we collected X-shooter spectra covering the entire pulsation cycle. The peak ([Fe\/H]=\u2212 1.59\u00b10.01) and the standard deviation (\u03c3= 0.43 dex) of the metallicity distribution agree quite well with similar estimates available in the literature. The current measurements disclose a well-defined \u2026",
                "We developed a new approach to provide accurate estimates of the metal content, reddening, and true distance modulus of RR Lyrae stars (RRLs). The method is based on homogeneous optical (BVI) and near-infrared (JHK) mean magnitudes and on predicted period\u2013luminosity\u2013metallicity relations (IJHK) and absolute mean magnitude\u2013metallicity relations (BV). We obtained solutions for three different RRL samples in \u03c9 Cen: first overtone (RRc, 90), fundamental (RRab, 80), and global (RRc+ RRab) in which the period of first overtones were fundamentalized. The metallicity distribution shows a well defined peak at [Fe\/H]~\u2212 1.98 and a standard deviation of \u03c3= 0.54 dex. The spread is, as expected, metal-poor ([Fe\/H]\u2264\u2212 2.3) objects. The current metallicity distribution is~ 0.3 dex more metal-poor than similar estimates for RRLs available in the literature. The difference vanishes if the true distance modulus we \u2026"
