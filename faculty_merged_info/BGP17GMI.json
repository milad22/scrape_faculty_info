Vah\u00e9 has 25 years of research experience in space science (specializing in geomagnetic storms and their societal impacts) with funding from NASA and the National Science Foundation.  In addition to his passion for astronomy, Vahe is an avid photographer and an author on the Serway and Jewett series of physics textbooks.  Since June 2005, Vahe has also served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Glendale Community College (GCC) in Glendale, California, a city-wise elected position to which he has been reelected three times.
