                "Cerebral hypothermia can improve outcome of experimental perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia. We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to find out if delayed head cooling can improve neurodevelopmental outcome in babies with neonatal encephalopathy.234 term infants with moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy and abnormal amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) were randomly assigned to either head cooling for 72 h, within 6 h of birth, with rectal temperature maintained at 34\u201335\u00b0C (n=116), or conventional care (n=118). Primary outcome was death or severe disability at 18 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. We examined in two predefined subgroup analyses the effect of hypothermia in babies with the most severe aEEG changes before randomisation\u2014ie, severe loss of background amplitude, and seizures\u2014and those with less severe changes \u2026",
                "Whether hypothermic therapy improves neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborn infants with asphyxial encephalopathy is uncertain.We performed a randomized trial of infants who were less than 6 hours of age and had a gestational age of at least 36 weeks and perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy. We compared intensive care plus cooling of the body to 33.5\u00b0C for 72 hours and intensive care alone. The primary outcome was death or severe disability at 18 months of age. Prespecified secondary outcomes included 12 neurologic outcomes and 14 other adverse outcomes.Of 325 infants enrolled, 163 underwent intensive care with cooling, and 162 underwent intensive care alone. In the cooled group, 42 infants died and 32 survived but had severe neurodevelopmental disability, whereas in the noncooled group, 44 infants died and 42 had severe disability (relative risk for either \u2026",
                "Objective To determine whether moderate hypothermia after hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy in neonates improves survival and neurological outcome at 18 months of age.Design A meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. Risk ratios, risk difference, and number needed to treat, plus 95% confidence intervals, were measured.Data sources Studies were identified from the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, the Oxford database of perinatal trials, PubMed, previous reviews, and abstracts.Review methods Reports that compared whole body cooling or selective head cooling with normal care in neonates with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and that included data on death or disability and on specific neurological outcomes of interest to patients and clinicians were selected. Results We found three trials, encompassing 767 infants, that included information on death and major \u2026",
                "Despite thymic deletion of cells with specificity for self-antigens, autoreactive T cells are readily detectable in the normal T-cell repertoire. In recent years, a population of CD4+ T cells that constitutively express the interleukin-2 receptor-\u03b1 chain, CD25, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the maintenance of self-tolerance in rodent models. This study investigated whether such a regulatory population exists in humans. A population of CD4+CD25+ T cells, taken from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and phenotypically distinct from recently activated CD4+ T cells, was characterized. These cells were hyporesponsive to conventional T-cell stimuli and capable of suppressing the responses of CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells in vitro. Addition of exogenous interleukin-2 abrogated the hyporesponsiveness and suppressive effects of CD4+CD25+ cells. Suppression required cell-to-cell contact but did not appear to be \u2026",
                "Phosphorus (31 P) spectra from the brains of severely birth-asphyxiated human infants are commonly normal on the first day of life. Later, cerebral energy failure develops, which carries a serious prognosis. The main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that this delayed (\u201csecondary\u201d) energy failure could be reproduced in the newborn piglet after a severe acute reversed cerebral hypoxicischemic insult. Twelve piglets were subjected to temporary occlusion of the common carotid arteries and hypoxemia [mean arterial Po 2 3.1 (SD 0.6) kPa]. Mean cerebral phosphocreatine concentration [PCr]\/inorganic orthophosphate concentration [Pi] decreased from 1.40 (SD 0.29) to 0.01 (SD 0.02), and nucleotide triphosphate concentration [NTP]\/exchangeable phosphate pool concentration [EPP] decreased from 0.19 (SD 0.02) to 0.06 (SD 0.04)(p< 0.001 for each decrease).

                "Current methods for measuring cerebral blood volume (CBV) in newborn infants are unsatisfactory. A new method is described in which the effect of a small change (5-10%) in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) on cerebral oxyhemoglobin [HbO2] and deoxyhemoglobin [Hb] concentration is observed by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Previous experiments in which the NIR absorption characteristics of HbO2 and Hb and the pathlength of NIR light through the brain were defined allowed changes in [HbO2] and [Hb] to be quantified from the Beer-Lambert law. It is shown here that CBV can then be derived from the expression CBV = (delta[HbO2] - delta[Hb])\/(2. delta SaO2.H.R.), where H is the large vessel total hemoglobin concentration and R to the cerebral-to-large vessel hematocrit ratio. Observations on 12 newborn infants with normal brains, born at 25-40 wk of gestation and aged 10-240 h, gave a mean value \u2026"
