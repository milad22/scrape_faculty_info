                "Inspection of ship hulls and marine structures using autonomous underwater vehicles has emerged as a unique and challenging application of robotics. The problem poses rich questions in physical design and operation, perception and navigation, and planning, driven by difficulties arising from the acoustic environment, poor water quality and the highly complex structures to be inspected. In this paper, we develop and apply algorithms for the central navigation and planning problems on ship hulls. These divide into two classes, suitable for the open, forward parts of a typical monohull, and for the complex areas around the shafting, propellers and rudders. On the open hull, we have integrated acoustic and visual mapping processes to achieve closed-loop control relative to features such as weld-lines and biofouling. In the complex area, we implemented new large-scale planning routines so as to achieve full \u2026",
                "We propose a lightweight and ground-optimized lidar odometry and mapping method, LeGO-LOAM, for realtime six degree-of-freedom pose estimation with ground vehicles. LeGO-LOAM is lightweight, as it can achieve realtime pose estimation on a low-power embedded system. LeGO-LOAM is ground-optimized, as it leverages the presence of a ground plane in its segmentation and optimization steps. We first apply point cloud segmentation to filter out noise, and feature extraction to obtain distinctive planar and edge features. A two-step Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method then uses the planar and edge features to solve different components of the six degree-of-freedom transformation across consecutive scans. We compare the performance of LeGO-LOAM with a state-of-the-art method, LOAM, using datasets gathered from variable-terrain environments with ground vehicles, and show that LeGO-LOAM \u2026",
                "In this paper we address the problem of drift-free navigation for underwater vehicles performing harbor surveillance and ship hull inspection. Maintaining accurate localization for the duration of a mission is important for a variety of tasks, such as planning the vehicle trajectory and ensuring coverage of the area to be inspected. Our approach only uses onboard sensors in a simultaneous localization and mapping setting and removes the need for any external infrastructure like acoustic beacons. We extract dense features from a forward-looking imaging sonar and apply pair-wise registration between sonar frames. The registrations are combined with onboard velocity, attitude and acceleration sensors to obtain an improved estimate of the vehicle trajectory. We show results from several experiments that demonstrate drift-free navigation in various underwater environments.",
                "We discuss the problem of inspecting an underwater structure, such as a submerged ship hull, with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Unlike a large body of prior work, we focus on planning the views of the AUV to improve the quality of the inspection, rather than maximizing the accuracy of a given data stream. We formulate the inspection planning problem as an extension to Bayesian active learning, and we show connections to recent theoretical guarantees in this area. We rigorously analyze the benefit of adaptive re-planning for such problems, and we prove that the potential benefit of adaptivity can be reduced from an exponential to a constant factor by changing the problem from cost minimization with a constraint on information gain to variance reduction with a constraint on cost. Such analysis allows the use of robust, non-adaptive planning algorithms that perform competitively with adaptive \u2026",
                "We present several new contributions in sampling-based coverage path planning, the task of finding feasible paths that give 100% sensor coverage of complex structures in obstaclefilled and visually occluded environments. First, we establish a framework for analyzing the probabilistic completeness of a sampling-based coverage algorithm, and derive results on the completeness and convergence of existing algorithms. Second, we introduce a new algorithm for the iterative improvement of a feasible coverage path; this relies on a samplingbased subroutine that makes asymptotically optimal local improvements to a feasible coverage path based on a strong generalization of the RRT* algorithm. We then apply the algorithm to the real-world task of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection. We use our improvement algorithm in conjunction with redundant roadmap coverage planning algorithm to produce paths that cover complex 3D environments with unprecedented efficiency.",
                "We discuss the problem of inspecting an underwater structure, such as a submerged ship hull, with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In such scenarios, the goal is to construct an accurate 3D model of the structure and to detect any anomalies (e.g., foreign objects or deformations). We propose a method for constructing 3D meshes from sonar-derived point clouds that provides watertight surfaces, and we introduce uncertainty modeling through non-parametric Bayesian regression. Uncertainty modeling provides novel cost functions for planning the path of the AUV to minimize a metric of inspection performance. We draw connections between the resulting cost functions and submodular optimization, which provides insight into the formal properties of active perception problems. In addition, we present experimental trials that utilize profiling sonar data from ship hull inspection.",
                "To support autonomous, in-water inspection of a ship hull, we propose and implement new techniques for coverage path planning over complex 3D structures. Our main contribution is a comprehensive methodology for sampling-based design of inspection routes, including an algorithm for planning, an algorithm for smoothing, and an analysis of probabilistic completeness. The latter two outcomes are the first of their kind in the area of coverage planning. Our algorithms give high-quality solutions over expansive structures, and we demonstrate this with experiments in the laboratory and on a 75 m Coast Guard cutter.",
                "We consider an autonomous exploration problem in which a mobile robot is guided by an information-based controller through an a priori unknown environment, choosing to collect its next measurement at the location estimated to be most informative within its current field of view. We propose a novel approach to predict mutual information (MI) using Bayesian optimization. Over several iterations, candidate sensing actions are suggested by Bayesian optimization and added to a committee that repeatedly trains a Gaussian process (GP). The GP estimates MI throughout the robot's action space, serving as the basis for an acquisition function used to select the next candidate. The best sensing action in the committee is executed by the robot. This approach is compared over several environments with two batch methods, one which chooses the most informative action from a set of pseudo-random samples whose MI is \u2026",
                "We introduce an algorithm to achieve complete sensor coverage of complex, three-dimensional structures surveyed by an autonomous agent with multiple degrees of freedom. Motivated by the application of an ocean vehicle performing an autonomous ship hull inspection, we consider a planning problem for a fully-actuated, six degree-of-freedom hovering AUV using a bathymetry sonar to inspect the complex structures underneath a ship hull. We consider a discrete model of the structure to be inspected, requiring only that the model be provided in the form of a closed triangular mesh. A dense graph of feasible paths is constructed in the robot's configuration space until the set of edges in the graph allows complete coverage of the structure. Then, we approximate the minimum-cost closed walk along the graph which observes 100% of the structure. We emphasize the embedding of observations within the edges of \u2026",
                "We present a novel algorithm to produce descriptive online 3D occupancy maps using Gaussian processes (GPs). GP regression and classification have met with recent success in their application to robot mapping, as GPs are capable of expressing rich correlation among map cells and sensor data. However, the cubic computational complexity has limited its application to large-scale mapping and online use. In this paper we address this issue first by proposing test-data octrees, octrees within blocks of the map that prune away nodes of the same state, condensing the number of test data used in a regression, in addition to allowing fast data retrieval. We also propose a nested Bayesian committee machine which, after new sensor data is partitioned among several GP regressions, fuses the result and updates the map with greatly reduced complexity. Finally, by adjusting the range of influence of the training data \u2026"
