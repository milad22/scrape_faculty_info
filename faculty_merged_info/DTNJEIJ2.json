                "Now beyond its eleventh printing and translated into twelve languages, Michael Porter\u2019s The Competitive Advantage of Nations has changed completely our conception of how prosperity is created and sustained in the modern global economy. Porter\u2019s groundbreaking study of international competitiveness has shaped national policy in countries around the world. It has also transformed thinking and action in states, cities, companies, and even entire regions such as Central America. Based on research in ten leading trading nations, The Competitive Advantage of Nations offers the first theory of competitiveness based on the causes of the productivity with which companies compete. Porter shows how traditional comparative advantages such as natural resources and pools of labor have been superseded as sources of prosperity, and how broad macroeconomic accounts of competitiveness are insufficient. The book introduces Porter\u2019s \u201cdiamond,\u201d a whole new way to understand the competitive position of a nation (or other locations) in global competition that is now an integral part of international business thinking. Porter's concept of \u201cclusters,\u201d or groups of interconnected firms, suppliers, related industries, and institutions that arise in particular locations, has become a new way for companies and governments to think about economies, assess the competitive advantage of locations, and set public policy. Even before publication of the book, Porter\u2019s theory had guided national reassessments in New Zealand and elsewhere. His ideas and personal involvement have shaped strategy in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Portugal, Taiwan, Costa \u2026",
                "Strategy may not be the most dynamic word in the business lexicon, but reports of its death as a core discipline are premature. The analytical approach to strategy first put forward in 1980 by Professor Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School was a watershed in business analysis. Measuring Business Excellence revisits Competitive Strategy, Professor Porter's seminal work, and finds that it remains a powerful framework for understanding the competitive situation faced by today's organizations.",

Senior executives understand that their organization's, measurement system strongly affects the behavior of managers and employees. Executives also understand that traditional financial accounting measures like return-on-investment and earnings-per-share can give misleading signals for continuous improvement and innovation-activities today's competitive envi-",
                "ow that companies can source capital, goods, information, and technology from around the world, often with the click of a mouse, much of the conventional wisdom about how companies and nations compete needs to be overhauled. In theory, more open global markets and faster transportation and communication should diminish the role of location in competition. After all, anything that can be efficiently sourced from a distance through global markets and corporate networks is available to any company and therefore is essentially nullified as a source of competitive advantage.",

America's security imperatives, however, have fundamentally changed. The central security challenge of the past half century\u2014the threat of communist expansion-is gone. The dangers we face today are more diverse... large-scale environmental degradation, exacerbated by rapid population growth, threatens to undermine political stability in many countries and regions....",
                "The fact is, the prevailing approaches to CSR are so fragmented and so disconnected from business and strategy as to obscure many of the greatest opportunities for companies to benefit society. If, instead, corporations were to analyze their prospects for social responsibility using the same frameworks that guide their core business choices, they would discover that CSR can be much more than a cost, a constraint, or a charitable deed\u2013it can be a source of opportunity, innovation, and competitive advantage.In this article, we propose a new way to look at the relationship between business and society that does not treat corporate success and social welfare as a zero-sum game. We introduce a framework companies can use to identify all of the effects, both positive and negative, they have on society; determine which ones to address; and",
