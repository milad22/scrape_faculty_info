                "A central question in the field of graphene-related research is how graphene behaves when it is patterned at the nanometre scale with different edge geometries. A fundamental shape relevant to this question is the graphene nanoribbon (GNR), a narrow strip of graphene that can have different chirality depending on the angle at which it is cut. Such GNRs have been predicted to exhibit a wide range of behaviour, including tunable energy gaps 1, 2 and the presence of one-dimensional (1D) edge states 3, 4, 5 with unusual magnetic structure 6, 7. Most GNRs measured up to now have been characterized by means of their electrical conductivity, leaving the relationship between electronic structure and local atomic geometry unclear 8, 9, 10. Here we present a sub-nanometre-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) study of GNRs that allows us to examine how GNR electronic \u2026",
                "We have developed a femtosecond electron diffraction system capable of directly measuring the complete transient structures with atomic level detail and on 400-fs time scale in solid materials. Additionally, a diffraction image with significant signal-to-noise ratio to reveal the long-range order can be obtained with a single electron pulse of 700 fs in duration. A direct observation of ultrafast lattice expansion following the irradiation of femtosecond pulsed laser of Ag film has been demonstrated.",
                "The edges of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted much interest due to their potentially strong influence on GNR electronic and magnetic properties. Here we report the ability to engineer the microscopic edge termination of high-quality GNRs via hydrogen plasma etching. Using a combination of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we have determined the exact atomic structure of plasma-etched GNR edges and established the chemical nature of terminating functional groups for zigzag, armchair, and chiral edge orientations. We find that the edges of hydrogen-plasma-etched GNRs are generally flat, free of structural reconstructions, and terminated by hydrogen atoms with no rehybridization of the outermost carbon edge atoms. Both zigzag and chiral edges show the presence of edge states.",
                "The dependence of supramolecular structure on fractional molecular coverage has been investigated for acridine-9-carboxylic acid (ACA) and the C60:ACA binary molecular system. The coverage-dependent phase diagram for ACA is first determined from room-temperature STM imaging. At low molecular coverages (\u03b8 < 0.4 ML, ML = monolayer), ACA forms a 2-D gas phase. Ordered ACA structures appear with increasing coverage:\u2009 first a chain structure composed of ACA molecules linked by consecutive O\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds (\u03b8 > 0.4 ML), then a dimer structure composed of ACA dimers linked by paired carboxyl-carboxyl hydrogen bonds (\u03b8 \u2248 1.0 ML). Structures of the C60:ACA binary system depend on the coverage of predeposited ACA. At intermediate (0.4 ML \u223c 0.8 ML) ACA coverages, C60 deposition results in a hexagonal cooperative structure with the C60 periodicity nearly 3 times that of the normal C \u2026",
                "We have demonstrated a method for fabricating C60 overlayers with controlled spacing and chirality by reactive coadsorption with the aromatic molecule acridine-9-carboxylic acid (ACA). Structural control is achieved by the mismatched symmetries of the coadsorbates, as well as specific intermolecular and adsorbate\u2212substrate interactions. The resulting supramolecular structure has a C60 period nearly three times as large as the normal C60 2D packing of 1 nm and exists in enantiopure domains with robust chirality. ",
                "In nanoscale metal wires, electrical current can cause structural changes through electromigration, in which the momentum of electrons biases atomic motion, but the microscopic details are complex. Using in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, we examined the effects of thermally excited defects on the current-biased displacement of monatomic islands of radius 2 to 50 nanometers on single-crystal Ag(111). The islands move opposite to the current direction, with velocity varying inversely with radius. The force is thus in the same direction as electron flow and acts on atomic defect sites at the island edge. The unexpectedly large force on the boundary atoms can be decreased by over a factor of 10 by adding a mildly electron-withdrawing adsorbate, C60, which also modifies the step geometry. The low coordination of the identified scattering sites is the likely origin of the large force.",
                "Two-dimensional (2D) metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as 1T-TiSe2, are ideal systems for exploring the fundamentals in condensed matter physics. However, controlled synthesis of these ultrathin materials has not been achieved. Here, we explored the synthesis of charge density wave (CDW)-bearing 2D TiSe2 with chemical vapor transport (CVT) by extending this bulk crystal growth approach to the surface growth of TiSe2 by introducing suitable growth substrates and dramatically slowing down the growth rate. Sub-10 nm TiSe2 flakes were successfully obtained, showing comparable quality to the mechanically exfoliated thin flakes. A CDW state with 2 \u00d7 2 superstructure was clearly observed on these ultrathin flakes by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and the phase transition temperature of these flakes was investigated by transport measurements, confirming the existence of CDW \u2026",
                "Two\u2010dimensional (2D) PtSe2 shows the most prominent layer\u2010dependent electrical properties among various 2D materials and high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and therefore, it is an ideal material for exploring the structure\u2013activity correlations in 2D systems. Here, starting with the synthesis of single\u2010crystalline 2D PtSe2 with a controlled number of layers and probing the HER catalytic activity of individual flakes in micro electrochemical cells, we investigated the layer\u2010dependent HER catalytic activity of 2D PtSe2 from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. We clearly demonstrated how the number of layers affects the number of active sites, the electronic structures, and electrical properties of 2D PtSe2 flakes and thus alters their catalytic performance for HER. Our results also highlight the importance of efficient electron transfer in achieving optimum activity for ultrathin \u2026",
                "Bipolar molecules incorporating donor and acceptor components within a single molecule create exciting device opportunities due to their possible use as nanoscale p\u2212n heterojunctions. Here we report a direct characterization of the internal electronic structure of a single bipolar molecular heterojunction, including subnanometer features of the intramolecular donor\u2212acceptor interface. Angstrom-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy was used to map the energy levels and spatial extent of molecular orbitals across the surface of an individual bipolar molecule, bithiophene naphthalene diimide (BND). We find that individual BND molecules exhibit type II heterojunction behavior with orbital energy shifts occurring over subnanometer intramolecular interface distances. Comparison of this behavior with first-principles theoretical modeling provides new insights into the optimization of these molecular systems.",
                "While pyrochlore iridate thin films are theoretically predicted to possess a variety of emergent topological properties, experimental verification of these predictions can be obstructed by the challenge in thin film growth. Here we report on the pulsed laser deposition and characterization of thin films of a representative pyrochlore compound Bi 2 Ir 2 O 7. The films were epitaxially grown on yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates and have lattice constants that are a few percent larger than that of the bulk single crystals. The film composition shows a strong dependence on the oxygen partial pressure. Density-functional-theory calculations indicate the existence of Bi Ir antisite defects, qualitatively consistent with the high Bi: Ir ratio found in the films. Both Ir and Bi have oxidation states that are lower than their nominal values, suggesting the existence of oxygen deficiency. The iridate thin films show a variety of intriguing \u2026"
