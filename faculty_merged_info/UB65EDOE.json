Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re's research focuses on understanding the multi-scale physical processes that govern galaxy formation in the cosmological context, including star formation, galaxy-black hole co-evolution, galactic dynamics, and connections with the intergalactic medium and cosmology. He uses a multi-pronged approach including: large-scale numerical simulations, analytic modeling, and comparisons with observational data. Prof. Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re holds a courtesy appointment at Argonne National Laboratory, where he collaborates with the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing group.
