Extremely precise measurements in atomic systems such as hydrogen, helium, and positronium are now requiring Quantum Electrodynamic calculations accurate to better than a part per million. Several such calculations, which require extensive use of computers, are in progress. Another area of research is parity violation in heavy atoms. This requires solution of the many-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation in these complex systems. Large-scale computer calculations then allow the interpretation of experiments measuring parity violation in terms of fundamental particle physics. Similar calculations in highly charged many-electron ions probe quantum electrodynamics in extreme environments. \u201cContributions to helium fine structure of order ma 7 ,\u201d K. Pachucki and J.
