                "Henry W. Sobel Henry W. Sobel Professor Emeritus of Physics & Astronomy hsobel@uci.edu (949) 824-6431 3133 Frederick Reines Hall Lab Phone: (949) 824-6395 Lab Office: 3126 Frederick Reines Hall Ph.D., Case Institute of Technology, 1968 B.S.,\u00a0Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Professor Sobel has devoted his adult life to studying neutrinos \u2013 mysterious subatomic particles essential to our understanding of matter and the universe.\u00a0Neutrinos are the most copious matter particles in the universe and played an important part in its formation.\u00a0They\u2019re also being produced in places like our sun, the stars and supernovae and can be used to study these objects in a way that\u2019s not possible with other means. \u00a0Massive underground detectors are used to capture\u00a0neutrinos. Professor Sobel is\u00a0heavily involved with\u00a0Japan\u2019s\u00a0Super-Kamiokande (Super-K)\u00a0experiment. He is\u00a0the U.S. co-spokesperson and serves\u00a0on the executive committee.\u00a0Using 10,000 photomultiplier tubes submerged in over 50 kilotons of aggressively purified water, Super-K enables physicists to study atmospheric neutrinos that shower down from above, as well as particles that reach the detector after traveling through our planet. \u00a0Super-K is also on the receiving end of a multinational experiment0\u00a0in which a neutrino beam is\u00a0launched by particle accelerators at a separate facility\u00a0more than 250 kilometers away in eastern Japan. The Super-K experiment discovered neutrino oscillations, the discovery that led to the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics. Sobel and his colleagues are also members of large international teams working on two next-generation projects. One involves a liquid argon-based detector in a South Dakota gold mine that will be a target for a neutrino beam from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago. Detectors are placed deep beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, often in decommissioned mines, to shield them from cosmic rays and other noise that can interfere with signals from desired particles.\u00a0The other project is an expansion of Super-K to be named\u00a0Hyper-Kamiokande because it will hold more than a megaton of purified water and over 100,000 photomultiplier tubes, a 20-fold increase over the existing detector.
