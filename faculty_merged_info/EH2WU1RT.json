                "This paper describes a novel design approach of the free piston Stirling engines (FPSEs) based on multiple-scale perturbation method. First, a comprehensive mathematical model for an FPSE possessing nonlinear springs is presented. Then, the method of multiple scales is used to obtain the steady-state response of the engine system. Thus, some useful analytical relationships to predict frequency, strokes of pistons, and phase angle, as well as output power and efficiency of the nonlinear FPSE, are presented. Furthermore, a systematic mathematical approach for estimating the gas temperatures within expansion and compression spaces of the FPSE is proposed based on the perturbation technique. Next, a simulation study is carried out to investigate how much the engine frequency, strokes of pistons, and phase angle of the FPSE are sensitive to the variation of gas temperature. Besides, the effect of changes in \u2026"
