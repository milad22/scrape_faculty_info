Six events pass all selection criteria at the far detector. In a three-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario with| \u0394 m 23 2|= 2.4\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2, sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 23= 1 and sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0, the expected number of such events is 1.5\u00b10.3 (syst). Under this hypothesis, the probability to observe six or more candidate events is 7\u00d7 10\u2212 3, equivalent to 2.5 \u03c3 significance. At 90% CL, the data are consistent with 0.03 (0.04)< sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13< 0.28 (0.34) for \u03b4 C P= 0 and a normal (inverted) hierarchy.",

                "The T2K experiment has observed electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam produced 295 km from the Super-Kamiokande detector with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV. A total of 28 electron neutrino events were detected with an energy distribution consistent with an appearance signal, corresponding to a significance of 7.3 \u03c3 when compared to 4.92\u00b10.55 expected background events. In the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata mixing model, the electron neutrino appearance signal depends on several parameters including three mixing angles \u03b8 12, \u03b8 23, \u03b8 13, a mass difference \u0394 m 32 2 and a C P violating phase \u03b4 C P. In this neutrino oscillation scenario, assuming| \u0394 m 32 2|= 2.4\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2, sin 2 \u03b8 23= 0.5, and \u0394 m 32 2> 0 (\u0394 m 32 2< 0), a best-fit value of sin 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.14 0\u2212 0.032+ 0.038 (0.17 0\u2212 0.037+ 0.045) is obtained at \u03b4 C P= 0.

                "The results of the third phase of the Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino measurement are presented and compared to the first and second phase results. With improved detector calibrations, a full detector simulation, and improved analysis methods, the systematic uncertainty on the total neutrino flux is estimated to be\u00b12.1%, which is about two thirds of the systematic uncertainty for the first phase of Super-Kamiokande. The observed B 8 solar flux in the 5.0 to 20 MeV total electron energy region is 2.32\u00b10.04 (stat)\u00b10.05 (sys)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 sec\u2212 1 under the assumption of pure electron-flavor content, in agreement with previous measurements. A combined oscillation analysis is carried out using SK-I, II, and III data, and the results are also combined with the results of other solar neutrino experiments. The best-fit oscillation parameters are obtained to be sin\ufeff 2 \u03b8 12= 0.30\u2212 0.01+ 0.02 (tan\ufeff 2 \u03b8 12= 0.42\u2212 0.02+ 0.04) and \u0394 m \u2026",
                "We report on measurements of neutrino oscillation using data from the T2K long-baseline neutrino experiment collected between 2010 and 2013. In an analysis of muon neutrino disappearance alone, we find the following estimates and 68% confidence intervals for the two possible mass hierarchies: normal hierarchy: sin 2 \u03b8 23= 0.51 4\u2212 0.056+ 0.055 and \u0394 m 32 2=(2.51\u00b10.10)\u00d7 1 0\u2212 3 eV 2\/c 4 and inverted hierarchy: sin 2 \u03b8 23= 0.511\u00b10.055 and \u0394 m 13 2=(2.48\u00b10.10)\u00d7 1 0\u2212 3 eV 2\/c 4. The analysis accounts for multinucleon mechanisms in neutrino interactions which were found to introduce negligible bias. We describe our first analyses that combine measurements of muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance to estimate four oscillation parameters,| \u0394 m 2|, sin 2 \u03b8 23, sin 2 \u03b8 13, \u03b4 C P, and the mass hierarchy. Frequentist and Bayesian intervals are presented for combinations of these \u2026",

                "New data from the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment produce the most precise measurement of the neutrino mixing parameter \u03b8 23. Using an off-axis neutrino beam with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV and a data set corresponding to 6.57\u00d7 1 0 20 protons on target, T2K has fit the energy-dependent \u03bd \u03bc oscillation probability to determine oscillation parameters. The 68% confidence limit on sin 2 (\u03b8 23) is 0.51 4\u2212 0.056+ 0.055 (0.511\u00b10.055), assuming normal (inverted) mass hierarchy. The best-fit mass-squared splitting for normal hierarchy is \u0394 m 32 2=(2.51\u00b10.10)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2\/c 4 (inverted hierarchy: \u0394 m 13 2=(2.48\u00b10.10)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2\/c 4). Adding a model of multinucleon interactions that affect neutrino energy reconstruction is found to produce only small biases in neutrino oscillation parameter extraction at current levels of statistical uncertainty.",
                "Super-Kamiokande (SK) can search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by detecting neutrinos produced from WIMP annihilations occurring inside the Sun. In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few\u2212 GeV\/c 2\u2212 200\u2212 GeV\/c 2) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun. We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross section \u2026"
