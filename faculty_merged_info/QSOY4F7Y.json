                "A single isolated attosecond pulse of 67 as was composed from an extreme UV supercontinuum covering 55\u2013130 eV generated by the double optical gating technique. Phase mismatch was used to exclude the single-atom cutoff of the spectrum that possesses unfavorable attochirp, allowing the positive attochirp of the remaining spectrum to be compensated by the negative dispersion of a zirconium foil. Two algorithms, PROOF and FROG-CRAB, were employed to retrieve the pulse from the experimental spectrogram, yielding nearly identical results.",
                "The generation of extremely short isolated attosecond pulses requires both a broad spectral bandwidth and control of the spectral phase. Rapid progress has been made in both aspects, leading to the generation of light pulses as short as 67 as in 2012, and broadband attosecond continua covering a wide range of extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray wavelengths. Such pulses have been successfully applied in photoelectron and photoion spectroscopy and recently developed attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study electron dynamics in matter. In this Review, we discuss significant recent advances in the generation, characterization and applications of ultrabroadband, isolated attosecond pulses with spectral bandwidths comparable to the central frequency. These pulses can in principle be compressed to a single optical cycle.",
                "Autoionization of argon atoms was studied experimentally by transient absorption spectroscopy with isolated attosecond pulses. The peak position, intensity, linewidth, and shape of the 3 s 3 p 6 n p P 1 Fano resonance series (26.6\u201329.2 eV) were modified by intense few-cycle near infrared laser pulses, while the delay between the attosecond pulse and the laser pulse was changed by a few femtoseconds. Numerical simulations revealed that the experimentally observed splitting of the 3 s 3 p 6 4 p P 1 line is caused by the coupling between two short-lived highly excited states in the strong laser field.",
                "Isolated attosecond pulses are powerful tools for exploring electron dynamics in matter. So far, such extreme ultraviolet pulses have only been generated using high power, few-cycle lasers, which are very difficult to construct and operate. We propose and demonstrate a technique called generalized double optical gating for generating isolated attosecond pulses with 20 fs lasers from a hollow-core fiber and 28 fs lasers directly from an amplifier. These pulses, generated from argon gas, are measured to be 260 and 148 as by reconstructing the streaked photoelectron spectrograms. This scheme, with a relaxed requirement on laser pulse duration, makes attophysics more accessible to many laboratories that are capable of producing such multicycle laser pulses.",
                "The motion of electrons in the microcosm occurs on a time scale set by the atomic unit of time\u201424 attoseconds. Attosecond pulses at photon energies corresponding to the fundamental absorption edges of matter, which lie in the soft X-ray regime above 200 eV, permit the probing of electronic excitation, chemical state, and atomic structure. Here we demonstrate a soft X-ray pulse duration of 53 as and single pulse streaking reaching the carbon K-absorption edge (284 eV) by utilizing intense two-cycle driving pulses near 1.8-\u03bcm center wavelength. Such pulses permit studies of electron dynamics in live biological samples and next-generation electronic materials such as diamond.",
                "Understanding and controlling the dynamic evolution of electrons in matter is among the most fundamental goals of attosecond science. While the most exotic behaviors can be found in complex systems, fast electron dynamics can be studied at the fundamental level in atomic systems, using moderately intense (\u2272 10 3 W\/cm 2) lasers to control the electronic structure in proof-of-principle experiments. Here, we probe the transient changes in the absorption of an isolated attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse by helium atoms in the presence of a delayed, few-cycle near infrared (NIR) laser pulse, which uncovers absorption structures corresponding to laser-induced \u201cvirtual\u201d intermediate states in the two-color two-photon (XUV+ NIR) and three-photon (XUV+ NIR+ NIR) absorption process. These previously unobserved absorption structures are modulated on half-cycle (~ 1.3 fs) and quarter-cycle (~ 0.6 fs \u2026",
                "Recent progress in sub-laser-cycle gating of high-order harmonic generation promises to push the limits on optical pulse durations below the atomic unit of time, 24 as, which corresponds to a bandwidth broader than 75 eV. However, the available techniques for attosecond pulse measurement are valid only for narrow-bandwidth spectra, due to one of the key approximations made in the phase retrieval. Here we report a new technique for characterizing attosecond pulses, whereby the spectral phase of the attosecond pulse is extracted from the oscillation component with the dressing laser frequency in the photoelectron spectrogram. This technique, termed PROOF (Phase Retrieval by Omega Oscillation Filtering), can be applied to characterizing attosecond pulses with ultrabroad bandwidths.",
                "Recent advances in attosecond science have relied upon the nearly instantaneous response of free electrons to an external field. However, it is still not clear whether bound electrons are able to rearrange on sublaser cycle time scales. Here, we probe the optical Stark shifts induced by a few-cycle near infrared laser field in helium bound states using isolated attosecond pulses in a transient absorption scheme and uncover a subcycle laser-induced energy level shift of the laser-dressed 1 s 3 p state.",
                "Helium atoms in the presence of extreme ultraviolet light pulses can lose electrons through direct photoionization or through two-electron excitation followed by autoionization. Here we demonstrate that, by combining attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses with near infrared femtosecond lasers, electron dynamics in helium autoionization can be not only monitored but also controlled. Furthermore, the interference between the two ionization channels was modified by the intense near infrared laser pulse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that double excitation and autoionization were studied experimentally by using isolated attosecond pulses.",
                "High-harmonic generation in isolated atoms and molecules has been widely utilized in extreme ultraviolet photonics and attosecond pulse metrology. Recently, high-harmonic generation has been observed in solids, which could lead to important applications such as all-optical methods to image valance charge density and reconstruct electronic band structures, as well as compact extreme ultraviolet light sources. So far these studies are confined to crystalline solids; therefore, decoupling the respective roles of long-range periodicity and high density has been challenging. Here we report the observation of high-harmonic generation from amorphous fused silica. We decouple the role of long-range periodicity by comparing harmonics generated from fused silica and crystalline quartz, which contain the same atomic constituents but differ in long-range periodicity. Our results advance current understanding of the \u2026"
