                "Jeremy Tinker Assistant Professor Ph. D. 2005, Ohio State University;\nB.S. University of Kansas My research focuses on the relationship between galaxies and dark matter. Galaxies are a biased tracer of the matter distribution, thus efforts to use the observed clustering of galaxies to infer cosmological information require a model for the galaxy-dark matter connection. At the same time, dark matter heavily influences the formation and evolution of the galaxies themselves. Galaxy clustering therefore provides important clues for unlocking the mystery of galaxy formation and the evolution of star formation. My work has utilized data from SDSS-I\/II, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, DEEP2, and COSMOS. I am a member of SDSS-III, specifically in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. It is my aim to use the data generated in this survey both to enhance our constraints on the growth of dark matter structure and dark energy, as well as further our knowledge on the evolution of massive galaxies over the last 8 billion years. What Does Clustering Tell us About the Buildup of the Red Sequence?
