We also apply our expertise in soft matter to challenges in nanoscience to answer fundamental scientific questions. In our group, we employ both soft and nanomaterials approaches to engineer multifunctional materials with tailored optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. These unique materials have diverse applications in areas such as photonics, fuel cells, supercapacitors, drug delivery vessels, scaffolds for tissue engineering, etc. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of our research, we closely collaborate with researchers from other fields including physics, chemistry, and biomedical engineering.
