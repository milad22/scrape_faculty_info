                "The fourth version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) was recently completed and released to the climate community. This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and documents fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 1 results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.4-resolution CCSM3. Two changes to the deep convection scheme in the atmosphere component result in CCSM4 producing El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation variability with a much more realistic frequency distribution than in CCSM3, although the amplitude is too large compared to observations. These changes also improve the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation and the frequency distribution of tropical precipitation. A new overflow parameterization in the ocean component \u2026"

Liang Yang Ph.D. Harvard University,  2006 Office: MH 5130 liyang@physics.ucsd.edu Current research interests center around the search for neutrinoless double-beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) and the direct detection of dark matter.\u00a0\u00a0 The group has played a leading role in the construction, operation, detector upgrade, and data analysis of the EXO-200 experiment, which has produced one of the most sensitive searches for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 of\u00a0136Xe. nEXO is a proposed tonne-scale experiment that aims to increase the experimental sensitivity to the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 halflife by more than two orders of magnitude.\u00a0 The UCSD group is leading an R&D\u00a0program to develop low-noise, low-background cold readout electronics for nEXO.\u00a0 The group is also exploring novel techniques to tag the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay daughter nucleus\u00a0136Ba in situ, which can completely eliminate the radioactivity-induced background and make it possible to build a background-free experiment.
