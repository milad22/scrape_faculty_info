In particular, I combine the tools of theoretical astrophysics, particle physics, and astronomical data analysis in order to probe dark matter, dark energy, and various processes that shaped the Universe before the time of the first stars. My research often involves coming up with new ways of using observations spanning the entire cosmic history---from the cosmic microwave background radiation to populations of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way---in order to test the fundamental fabric of nature.
