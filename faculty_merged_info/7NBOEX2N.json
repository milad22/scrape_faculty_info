                "The CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) is used to study photo-and electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions by providing efficient detection of neutral and charged particles over a good fraction of the full solid angle. A collaboration of about 30 institutions has designed, assembled, and commissioned CLAS in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The CLAS detector is based on a novel six-coil toroidal magnet which provides a largely azimuthal field distribution. Trajectory reconstruction using drift chambers results in a momentum resolution of 0.5% at forward angles. Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters provide good particle identification. Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of 10 34 nucleon cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. These capabilities are being used in a broad experimental program to study the \u2026",
                "Experimental results obtained at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron on the structure-function ratio F 2 n\/F 2 p in the kinematic range 0.004< x< 0.8 and 0.4< Q 2< 190 GeV 2, together with the structure function F 2 d determined from a fit to published data, are used to derive the difference F 2 p (x)-F 2 n (x). The value of the Gottfried sum F (F 2 p-F 2 n) dx\/x= 0.240\u00b10.016 is below the quark-parton-model expectation of 1\/3.",
                "In an exclusive measurement of the reaction \u03b3 d\u2192 K+ K\u2212 p n, a narrow peak that can be attributed to an exotic baryon with strangeness S=+ 1 is seen in the K+ n invariant mass spectrum. The peak is at 1.542\u00b10.005 G e V\/c 2 with a measured width of 0.021 G e V\/c 2 FWHM, which is largely determined by experimental mass resolution. The statistical significance of the peak is (5.2\u00b10.6) \u03c3. The mass and width of the observed peak are consistent with recent reports of a narrow S=+ 1 baryon by other experimental groups.",
                "We present a new determination of the nonsinglet structure function F 2 p-F 2 n at Q 2= 4 GeV 2 using recently measured values of F 2 d and F 2 n\/F 2 p. A new evaluation of the Gottfried sum is given, which remains below the simple quark-parton model value of 1\/3."

The field addresses questions that, as a practical matter, do not require the highest beam energies or luminosities, but do call for high-precision measurements using specialized equipment. Currently, my main area of work is in the electromagnetic production of strange particles (kaons and hyperons). The production of strange-quark pairs via the well-known electromagnetic interaction gives us an avenue for refining our knowledge of baryon resonances, coupling constants, and polarization observables; the results are compared with modern quark models and with unitarized chiral perturbation theory. This work is being done at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility ( JLab ). More exactly, my experimental work is done using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer ( CLAS ) in Hall B and using the GlueX detector ( GlueX ) in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. D. Ho, R. A.
