He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Virginia from 1992-1994, and at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1994-1998. He joined the faculties of physics and astronomy at Illinois in January 1999. Professor Gammie's research involves black holes, star and planet formation, and accretion physics. He is a leader in the computer simulation of astrophysical plasmas, particularly studies of hot plasmas accreting onto black holes. He was named a University Scholar and a Richard and Margaret Romano Professorial Scholar in 2007.

Though it is the most familiar object in the night sky, the Moon\u2019s origin remains in many ways mysterious.\u00a0Researchers at the Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe (ICASU) are the first to examine the role of magnetic fields in the formation of Earth\u2019s Moon,\u00a0offering new insights into how and when the Moon may have formed. M87's black hole crescent wobbles In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration published the first images of a black hole, the one at the center of the nearby galaxy M87. Now, a new analysis of unexplored archival data from as early as 2009 has shown that although the size and shape of the crescent-like asymmetry present in the original image is a consistent feature of the data, its orientation varies. The crescent wobbles.The full results have been published in The Astrophysics Journal . Research Funding Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe awarded $1.2 million in two NSF grants Scientists at the newly founded Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe (ICASU) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have been awarded $1.2 million total in two grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF). In the Media Charles Gammie among EHT leadership featured in Bloomberg 50 Albert Einstein was right again. More than 100 years ago, his calculations suggested that when too much energy or matter is concentrated in one place, it will collapse in on itself and turn into a dark vortex of nothingness. Physicists found evidence to support Einstein\u2019s black hole concept, but they\u2019d never observed one directly. In 2017, 200-plus scientists affiliated with more than 60 institutions set out to change that, using eight global radio observatories to chart the sky for 10 days. In April they released their findings , which included an image of a dark circle surrounded by a fiery doughnut (the galaxy Messier 87), 55 million light years away and 6.5 billion times more massive than our sun. \u201cWe have seen what we thought was unseeable,\u201d said Shep Doeleman, leader of what came to be known as the Event Horizon Telescope team. The team\u2019s name refers to the edge of a black hole, the point beyond which light and matter cannot escape. In some ways, the first picture of a black hole is also the first picture of nothing."
