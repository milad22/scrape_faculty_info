                "Ed Stech Ed Stech Research Professor Nuclear Physics B.S., magna cum laude, University of Notre Dame, 1995 M.S., ibid., 2001 Ph.D., ibid., 2004 E-mail: estech (at) nd (dot) edu Address: Nieuwland Science Hall 210A  Phone: (574) 631-8297 or (574) 631-7716 Fax: (574) 631-5952 My main focus is working as a member of Prof. Michael Wiescher\u2019s research group to study nuclear reactions which are important to the understanding of energy production and the origin of elements in stars and explosive stellar environments. I primarily work with the accelerators in the Nuclear Science Laboratory and assist faculty, graduate, and undergraduate researchers with their experiments. In addition, I am involved in using the accelerators at Notre Dame for more applied applications including the development of a Particle Induced X-Ray Emission ( PIXE ) setup using the FN tandem accelerator. Through this program, I have worked with people from several departments on campus as well as other outside users. I have also been heavily involved with JINA\u2019s PIXE PAN program which brings the physics of the lab to high school teachers and students during two weeks during each summer. CV - Dr. Ed Stech"
