D., M.I.T., 1979 Office: SERF 436 Phone: 858-534-4025 pdiamond@ucsd.edu I maintain an active interest in many theoretical problems pertaining to turbulence, transport and self-organization in plasmas fluids and non-equilibrium systems, in general. These include bifurcated mean flow states in turbulent shear flows, magnetic dynamos, confinement and turbulence in magnetized plasmas, flows in granular media, anomalous viscosity mechanisms in accretion disks and MHD turbulence. I am also actively involved with several aspects of the Magnetic Fusion Energy Program. Non-equilibrium statistical dynamics is a rich subject, so I am always alert for interesting new problems."
