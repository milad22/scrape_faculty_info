                "Starburst99 is a comprehensive set of model predictions for spectrophotometric and related properties of galaxies with active star formation. The models are an improved and extended version of the data set previously published by Leitherer & Heckman. We have upgraded our code by implementing the latest set of stellar evolution models of the Geneva group and the model atmosphere grid compiled by Lejeune et al. Several predictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown here for the first time. The models are presented in a homogeneous way for five metallicities between   and 0.001 and three choices of the initial mass function. The age coverage is 106\u2013109 yr. We also show the spectral energy distributions which are used to compute colors and other quantities. The full data set is available for retrieval at a Web site, which allows users to run specific models with nonstandard \u2026",
                " This special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters is dedicated to presenting initial results from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) that are primarily, but not exclusively, based on multiband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The survey covers roughly 320 arcmin2 in the ACS F435W, F606W, F814W, and F850LP bands, divided into two well\u2010studied fields. Existing deep observations from the Chandra X\u2010Ray Observatory and ground\u2010based facilities are supplemented with new, deep imaging in the optical and near\u2010infrared from the European Southern Observatory and from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Deep observations with the Space Infrared Telescope Facility are scheduled. Reduced data from all facilities are being released worldwide within 3\u20136 months of acquisition.

                "The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift (z) range 8-1.5. It will image> 250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z> 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 10 9 M\u2609 to z\u2248 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z\u2248 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin 2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS\/Deep survey (5\u03c3 point-source limit \u2026",
                "This paper describes the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data products and data reduction procedures for the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z\u2248 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z> 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3\/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet\/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS\/Deep survey covers~ 125 arcmin 2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS\/Wide survey, achieving a total of~ 800 arcmin 2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep \u2026",
                "We present results from the Hubble Higher z Supernova Search, the first space\u2010based open field survey for supernovae (SNe). In cooperation with the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, we have used the Hubble Space Telescope with the Advanced Camera for Surveys to cover \u223c300 arcmin2 in the area of the Chandra Deep Field South and the Hubble Deep Field North on five separate search epochs (separated by \u223c45 day intervals) to a limiting magnitude of  . These deep observations have allowed us to discover 42 SNe in the redshift range  . As these data span a large range in redshift, they are ideal for testing the validity of Type Ia supernova progenitor models with the distribution of expected \u201cdelay times,\u201d from progenitor star formation to Type Ia SN explosion, and the SN rates these models predict. Through a Bayesian maximum likelihood test, we determine which delay\u2010time models best reproduce \u2026",
                "We report the results of a systematic study of the vacuum ultraviolet (\u03bb sime 1150-2000 \u00c5) spectra of a sample of 45 starburst and related galaxies observed with the IUE satellite. These span broad ranges in metallicity (from 0.02 to 3 times solar), bolometric luminosity (~ 10 7-4\u00d7 10 11 L\u2609), and galaxy properties (eg, including low-mass dwarf galaxies, normal disk galaxies, and massive galactic mergers). The projected size of the IUE spectroscopic aperture is typically 1 to several kpc and therefore usually encompasses the entire starburst and is similar to the aperture sizes used for spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies. Our principal conclusion is that local starbursts occupy a very small fractional volume in the multidimensional manifold defined by such fundamental parameters as the extinction, metallicity, and vacuum-UV line strengths (both stellar and interstellar) of the starburst and the rotation speed (mass) and \u2026",
                "The Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S) observations targeted a high Galactic latitude field near QSO J2233-606. We present Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations of the field in four wide bandpasses centered at roughly 300, 450, 606, and 814 nm. Observations, data reduction procedures, and noise properties of the final images are discussed in detail. A catalog of sources is presented, and the number counts and color distributions of the galaxies are compared with a new catalog of the original Hubble Deep Field (HDF-N) that has been constructed in an identical manner. The two fields are qualitatively similar, with the galaxy number counts for the two fields agreeing to within 20%. The HDF-S has more candidate Lyman break galaxies at z> 2 than the HDF-N. The star formation rate per unit volume computed from the HDF-S, based on the UV luminosity of high-redshift candidates, is a factor of 1.9 higher \u2026",
                "We use HST\/WFC3 imaging from the CANDELS Multi-Cycle Treasury Survey, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to explore the evolution of galactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses> 3\u00d7 10 10 M\u2609 from z= 2.2 to the present epoch, a time span of 10 Gyr. We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z= 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3\u00d7 10 10 M\u2609 reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the S\u00e9rsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, S\u00e9rsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly \u2026",

                "SN 1997D in NGC 1536 is possibly the least luminous and energetic Type II supernova discovered to date. The entire light curve is subluminous, never reaching M V=-14.65. The radioactive tail follows the 56 Co decay slope. In the case of a nearly complete trapping of the \u03b3-rays, the 56 Ni mass derived from the tail brightness is extremely small,~ 0.002 M\u2609. At discovery, the spectra showed a red continuum and line velocities on the order of 1000 km s\u2212 1. The luminosity and the photospheric expansion velocity suggest that the explosion occurred about 50 days before discovery and that a plateau probably followed. Model light curves and spectra of the explosion of a 26 M\u2609 star successfully fitted the observations. Low-mass models are inconsistent with the observations. The radius of the progenitor, constrained by the prediscovery upper limits, is R 0 lesssim 300 R\u2609. A low explosion energy of~ 4\u00d7 10 50 ergs is \u2026"
