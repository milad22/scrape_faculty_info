                "We address the nature of the Mott transition in the Hubbard model at half-filling using cluster dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We compare cluster-DMFT results with those of single-site DMFT. We show that inclusion of the short-range correlations on top of the on-site correlations does not change the order of the transition between the paramagnetic metal and the paramagnetic Mott insulator, which remains first order. However, the short range correlations reduce substantially the critical U and modify the shape of the transition lines. Moreover, they lead to very different physical properties of the metallic and insulating phases near the transition point. Approaching the transition from the metallic side, we find an anomalous metallic state with very low coherence scale. The insulating state is characterized by the narrow Mott gap with pronounced peaks at the gap edge.",
                "A combination of density functional and dynamical mean field theory calculations are used to show that the remarkable metal-insulator transition in the rare-earth-element nickelate perovskites arises from a site-selective Mott phase, in which the d electrons on half of the Ni ions are localized to form a fluctuating moment while the d electrons on other Ni ions form a singlet with holes on the surrounding oxygen ions. The calculation reproduces key features observed in the nickelate materials, including an insulating gap in the paramagnetic state, a strong variation of static magnetic moments among Ni sites and an absence of charge order. A connection between structure and insulating behavior is documented. The site-selective Mott transition may be a more broadly applicable concept in the description of correlated materials.",
                "Since the discovery of the metallic antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state near superconductivity in iron pnictide superconductors 1, 2, 3, a central question has been whether magnetism in these materials arises from weakly correlated electrons 4, 5, as in the case of spin density wave in pure chromium 6, requires strong electron correlations 7, or can even be described in terms of localized electrons 8, 9 such as the AF insulating state of copper oxides 10. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to determine the absolute intensity of the magnetic excitations throughout the Brillouin zone in electron-doped superconducting BaFe 1.9 Ni 0.1 As 2 (T c= 20 K), which allows us to obtain the size of the fluctuating magnetic moment< m 2>, and its energy distribution 11, 12. We find that superconducting BaFe 1.9 Ni 0.1 As 2 and AF BaFe 2 As 2 (ref. 13) both have fluctuating magnetic moments< m 2>\u2248 3.2 \u03bc B 2 per Fe (Ni \u2026",
                "We study the magnetic excitation spectra in the paramagnetic state of BaFe 2 As 2 from the ab initio perspective. Both the one-particle and the magnetic two-particle excitation spectra are determined within the combination of the density functional theory and the dynamical mean-field theory method. This method reproduces all the experimentally observed features in inelastic neutron scattering and relates them to both the one-particle excitations and the collective modes. The magnetic excitation dispersion is well accounted for by our theoretical calculation in the paramagnetic state without any broken symmetry; hence, nematic order is not needed to explain the inelastic neutron scattering experimental data.",
                "A full implementation of the ab initio density functional plus dynamical mean field theory (DFT+ DMFT) formalism to perform total energy calculations and structural relaxations is proposed and implemented. The method is applied to the structural and metal-insulator transitions of the rare earth nickelate perovskites as a function of rare earth ion, pressure, and temperature. In contrast to previous DFT and DFT+ U theories, the present method accounts for the experimentally observed structure of LaNiO 3 and the insulating nature of the other perovskites, and quantitatively reproduces the metal-insulator and structural phase diagram in the plane of pressure and rare earth element. The temperature dependence of the energetics of the phase transformation indicates that the thermal transition is driven by phonon entropy effects.",
                "Dynamical mean field theory calculations are used to show that for late transition metal oxides a critical variable for the Mott\/charge-transfer transition is the number of d electrons, which is determined by charge transfer from oxygen ions. Insulating behavior is found only for a narrow range of d occupancy, irrespective of the size of the intra-d Coulomb repulsion. The result is useful in interpreting \u201cdensity functional+ U\u201d and \u201cdensity functional plus dynamical mean field\u201d methods in which additional correlations are applied to a specific set of orbitals and an important role is played by the \u201cdouble counting correction\u201d which dictates the occupancy of these correlated orbitals. General considerations are presented and are illustrated by calculations for two representative transition metal oxide systems: layered perovskite Cu-based high-T c materials, an orbitally nondegenerate electronically quasi-two-dimensional system \u2026",
                "We have formulated and implemented a fully charge self-consistent density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory methodology which enables an efficient calculation of the total energy of realistic correlated electron systems. The density functional portion of the calculation uses a planewave basis set within the projector augmented wave method enabling study of systems with large, complex unit cells. The dynamical mean-field portion of the calculation is formulated using maximally localized Wannier functions, enabling a convenient implementation which is independent of the basis set used in the density functional portion of the calculation. The importance of using a correct double-counting term is demonstrated. A generalized form of the standard double-counting correction, which we refer to as the U\u2032 form, is described in detail and used. For comparison, the density functional plus U method is \u2026",
                "We revisit Nagaoka ferromagnetism in the U=\u221e Hubbard model within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using the recently developed continuous time quantum Monte Carlo method as the impurity solver. The stability of Nagaoka ferromagnetism is studied as a function of the temperature, the doping level, and the next-nearest-neighbor lattice hopping t\u2032. We found that the nature of the phase transition, as well as the stability of the ferromagnetic state, is very sensitive to the t\u2032 hopping. Negative t\u2032=\u2212 0.1 t stabilizes ferromagnetism up to higher doping levels. The paramagnetic state is reached through a first-order phase transition. Alternatively, a second-order phase transition is observed at t\u2032= 0. Very near half-filling, the coherence temperature T coh of the paramagnetic metal becomes very low and ferromagnetism evolves out of an incoherent metal rather than conventional Fermi liquid. We use the DMFT \u2026",
                "We present evidence that the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a tensile-strained NdNiO 3 (NNO) film is facilitated by a redistribution of electronic density and that it neither requires Ni charge disproportionation nor a symmetry change [U. Staub et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 126402 (2002); R. Jaramillo et al., Nat. Phys. 10, 304 (2014)]. Given that epitaxial tensile strain in thin NNO films induces preferential occupancy of the e g d x 2\u2212 y 2 orbital we propose that the larger transfer integral of this orbital state with the O 2 p orbital state mediates a redistribution of electronic density from the Ni atom. A decrease in the Ni d x 2\u2212 y 2 orbital occupation is directly observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering below the MIT temperature. Furthermore, an increase in the Nd charge occupancy is measured by x-ray absorption at the Nd L 3 edge. Both spin-orbit coupling and crystal field effects combine to break the degeneracy of the \u2026",
                "The electronic correlation strength is a basic quantity that characterizes the physical properties of materials such as transition metal oxides. Determining correlation strengths requires both precise definitions and a careful comparison between experiment and theory. In this paper, we define the correlation strength via the magnitude of the electron self-energy near the Fermi level. For the case of LaNiO 3, we obtain both the experimental and theoretical mass enhancements m\u2606\/m by considering high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional+ dynamical mean field theory (DFT+ DMFT) calculations. We use valence-band photoemission data to constrain the free parameters in the theory and demonstrate a quantitative agreement between the experiment and theory when both the realistic crystal structure and strong electronic correlations are taken into \u2026"
