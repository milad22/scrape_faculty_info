                "Photonic crystals built with time-reversal-symmetry-breaking Faraday-effect media can exhibit chiral edge modes that propagate unidirectionally along boundaries across which the Faraday axis reverses. These modes are precise analogs of the electronic edge states of quantum-Hall-effect (QHE) systems, and are also immune to backscattering and localization by disorder. The Berry curvature of the photonic bands plays a role analogous to that of the magnetic field in the QHE. Explicit calculations demonstrating the existence of such unidirectionally propagating photonic edge states are presented.",

The superfluid He 3 B phase provides a physical realization of the topological superfluidity, with experimentally measurable surface states protected by the time-reversal symmetry. We show that the time-reversal symmetry naturally emerges as a supersymmetry, which changes the parity of the fermion number associated with each time-reversal invariant vortex and connects each vortex with its superpartner.",

Damia, J. A., Kachru, S., Raghu, S., Torroba, G. 2019 123 (9) : 096402 Significant effort has been devoted to the study of \"non-Fermi-liquid\" (NFL) metals: gapless conducting systems that lack a quasiparticle description. One class of NFL metals involves a finite density of fermions interacting with soft order parameter fluctuations near a quantum critical point. The problem has been extensively studied in a large-N limit (N corresponding to the number of fermion flavors) where universal behavior can be obtained by solving a set of coupled saddle-point equations. However, a remarkable study by Lee revealed the breakdown of such approximations in two spatial dimensions. We show that an alternate approach, in which the fermions belong to the fundamental representation of a global SU(N) flavor symmetry, while the order parameter fields transform under the adjoint representation (a \"matrix large-N\" theory), yields a tractable large N limit. At low energies, the system consists of an overdamped boson with dynamical exponent z=3 coupled to a non-Fermi-liquid with self-energy \u03a3(\u03c9)\u223c\u03c9^{2\/3}, consistent with previous studies.

Y. 121 (16) : 167003 We have examined the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and orbital depairing in thin films of Nb-doped SrTiO_{3} by superconducting tunneling spectroscopy. The orbital depairing is geometrically suppressed in the two-dimensional limit, enabling a quantitative evaluation of the Fermi level spin-orbit scattering using Maki's theory. The response of the superconducting gap under in-plane magnetic fields demonstrates short spin-orbit scattering times \u03c4_{so}\u22641.1\u2009\u2009ps. Analysis of the orbital depairing indicates that the heavy electron band contributes significantly to pairing. These results suggest that the intrinsic spin-orbit scattering time in SrTiO_{3} is comparable to those associated with Rashba effects in SrTiO_{3} interfacial conducting layers and can be considered significant in all forms of superconductivity in SrTiO_{3}.

Y. 9 (1) : 4008 Quantum ground states that arise at atomically controlled oxide interfaces provide an opportunity to address key questions in condensed matter physics, including the nature of two-dimensional metallic behaviour often observed adjacent to superconductivity. At the superconducting LaAlO3\/SrTiO3 interface, a metallic ground state emerges upon the collapse of superconductivity with field-effect gating and is accompanied with a pseudogap. Here we utilize independent control of carrier density and disorder of the interfacial superconductor using dual electrostatic gates, which enables the comprehensive examination of the electronic phase diagram approaching zero temperature. We find that the pseudogap corresponds to precursor pairing, and the onset of long-range phase coherence forms a two-dimensional superconducting dome as a function of the dual-gate voltages. The gate-tuned superconductor-metal transitions are driven by macroscopic phase fluctuations of Josephson coupled superconducting puddles.

A., Hikita, Y., Raghu, S., Devereaux, T. P., Johnston, S., Hwang, H. Y. 115 (7) : 1475\u201380 The nature of superconductivity in the dilute semiconductor SrTiO3 has remained an open question for more than 50 y. The extremely low carrier densities ([Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] cm-3) at which superconductivity occurs suggest an unconventional origin of superconductivity outside of the adiabatic limit on which the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theories are based. We take advantage of a newly developed method for engineering band alignments at oxide interfaces and access the electronic structure of Nb-doped SrTiO3, using high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy. We observe strong coupling to the highest-energy longitudinal optic (LO) phonon branch and estimate the doping evolution of the dimensionless electron-phonon interaction strength ([Formula: see text]). Upon cooling below the superconducting transition temperature ([Formula: see text]), we observe a single superconducting gap corresponding to the weak-coupling limit of BCS theory, indicating an order of magnitude smaller coupling ([Formula: see text]). These results suggest that despite the strong normal state interaction with electrons, the highest LO phonon does not provide a dominant contribution to pairing. They further demonstrate that SrTiO3 is an ideal system to probe superconductivity over a wide range of carrier density, adiabatic parameter, and electron-phonon coupling strength.

For materials that harbour a continuous phase transition, the susceptibility of the material to various fields can be used to understand the nature of the fluctuating order and hence the nature of the ordered state. Here we use anisotropic biaxial strain to probe the nematic susceptibility of URu2Si2, a heavy fermion material for which the nature of the low temperature 'hidden order' state has defied comprehensive understanding for over 30 years. Our measurements reveal that the fluctuating order has a nematic component, confirming reports of twofold anisotropy in the broken symmetry state and strongly constraining theoretical models of the hidden-order phase.

It is shown that no vortices exist in s-wave SC samples with R < R(c) ~ \u03be(0), the T = 0 coherence length. We predict that chiral p-wave states exhibit superconductivity for R < R(c) only in the presence of a vortex with opposite chirality. This induced SC phase is a consequence of nonzero chirality of the pairing order parameter and implies the presence of chiral edge currents. Our study may be applied to sharply probing the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors.

P. 108 (40) : 16549-16553 The behavior of matter near zero temperature continuous phase transitions, or \"quantum critical points\" is a central topic of study in condensed matter physics. In fermionic systems, fundamental questions remain unanswered: the nature of the quantum critical regime is unclear because of the apparent breakdown of the concept of the quasiparticle, a cornerstone of existing theories of strongly interacting metals. Even less is known experimentally about the formation of ordered phases from such a quantum critical \"soup.\" Here, we report a study of the specific heat across the phase diagram of the model system Sr(3)Ru(2)O(7), which features an anomalous phase whose transport properties are consistent with those of an electronic nematic. We show that this phase, which exists at low temperatures in a narrow range of magnetic fields, forms directly from a quantum critical state, and contains more entropy than mean-field calculations predict. Our results suggest that this extra entropy is due to remnant degrees of freedom from the highly entropic state above T(c). The associated quantum critical point, which is \"concealed\" by the nematic phase, separates two Fermi liquids, neither of which has an identifiable spontaneously broken symmetry, but which likely differ in the topology of their Fermi surfaces.

A. 105 (13) We show that the interplay between spin and charge fluctuations in Sr\u2082RuO\u2084 leads unequivocally to triplet pairing which has a hidden quasi-one-dimensional character. The resulting superconducting state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is of the form \u0394 ~(p(x)+ip(y))z(^) with sharp gap minima and a d vector that is only weakly pinned. The superconductor lacks robust chiral Majorana fermion modes along the boundary. The absence of topologically protected edge modes could explain the surprising absence of experimentally detectable edge currents in this system.

B., Qi, X., Zhang, S. 104 (11) We study low energy collective modes and transport properties of the \"helical metal\" on the surface of a topological insulator. At low energies, electrical transport and spin dynamics at the surface are exactly related by an operator identity equating the electric current to the in-plane components of the spin degrees of freedom. From this relation it follows that an undamped spin wave always accompanies the sound mode in the helical metal-thus it is possible to \"hear\" the sound of spins. In the presence of long range Coulomb interactions, the surface plasmon mode is also coupled to the spin wave, giving rise to a hybridized \"spin-plasmon\" mode. We make quantitative predictions for the spin-plasmon in Bi2Se3, and discuss its detection in a spin-grating experiment.

The superfluid 3He B phase provides a physical realization of the topological superfluidity, with experimentally measurable surface states protected by the time-reversal symmetry.

Because of the frustrated nature of the second-neighbor interactions, topological Mott phases displaying the quantum Hall and the quantum spin Hall effects are found for spinless and spin fermion models, respectively. The mean-field phase diagram is presented and the fluctuations are treated within the random phase approximation.

L., Raghu, S., Arovas, D. P. 99 (14) We predict the existence of a three-dimensional quantum Hall effect plateau in a graphite crystal subject to a magnetic field. The plateau has a Hall conductivity quantized at 4e2\/variant Planck's over 2pi 1\/c0 with c0 the c-axis lattice constant. We analyze the three-dimensional Hofstadter problem of a realistic tight-binding Hamiltonian for graphite, find the gaps in the spectrum, and estimate the critical value of the magnetic field above which the Hall plateau appears. When the Fermi level is in the bulk Landau gap, Hall transport occurs through the appearance of chiral surface states. We estimate the magnetic field necessary for the appearance of the effect to be 15.4 T for electron carriers and 7.0 T for holes.

We find that the Nernst effect has a much sharper temperature decay than predicted by Gaussian fluctuations, with an onset temperature that tracks Tc rather than the pairing temperature. We find a close quantitative connection with diamagnetism--the ratio of magnetization to transverse thermoelectric conductivity reaches a fixed value at high temperatures. We interpret measurements on underdoped cuprates in terms of a dilute vortex liquid over a wide temperature range above Tc.
