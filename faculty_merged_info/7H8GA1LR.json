                "John Hanneken Collaborations Hanneken John Hanneken Professor Emeritus jhannekn@memphis.edu Biography Prof. Hanneken joined the physics department faculty in January of 1979. He received\n                  the Superior Performance in University Research award in 1984 and 1985. He received\n                  the Distinguished Service Award from the Tennessee Academy of Science in 1985. In\n                  1992 he was awarded the University Distinguished Teaching Award and was awarded the\n                  Thomas W. Briggs Distinguished Teaching Award in 2005. He is a member of Sigma Xi,\n                  Phi Kappa Phi National Honor Society, Sigma Pi Sigma Physics Honor Society, Omicron\n                  Delta Kappa, Blue Key and Golden Key National Honor Societies, Pi Mu Epsilon Math\n                  Honor Society and Chi Beta Phi National Science Honor Society. His professional memberships include American Physical Society, American Association\n                  of Physics Teachers, International Association of Hydrogen Energy and Fractional Calculus\n                  and Applied Analysis. His experimental research (1979-1998) involved hydrogen in metals,\n                  hydrogen diffusion and electrotransport, absorption kinetics and hydrogen surface\n                  impedance and catalysis. His theoretical research (1998 \u2013 present) is in the area\n                  of applications of fractional calculus in physics, fractional diffusion, fractional\n                  oscillators, and Mittag-Leffler functions. He is a reviewer for several journals and frequently reviews textbooks for publishers.\n                  He has published 48 refereed journal articles, 70 abstracts and authored 6 laboratory\n                  manuals."
