                "Topological semimetal (TSM) AuTe 2 Br thin flakes have been studied by Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport measurement. The angle-resolved polarized Raman spectrum of AuTe 2 Br (bulk and thin flake) shows strong anisotropy. Together with high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we establish a non-destructive method to determine the crystallographic orientation of AuTe 2 Br flakes. At high temperature (T> 50 K), the magneto-resistance (MR) of AuTe 2 Br thin flakes shows typical parabolic-like behavior, which can be well fitted by the two-fluid model. However, at low temperature (T\u2264 30 K), the MR of thin flakes (< 17 nm) clearly deviates from the two-fluid model as well as from the Kohler's rule, suggesting a new type of scattering emerging below 30 K. Several possible scattering mechanisms are discussed and the respective corrections to MR are compared with our experimental \u2026"
