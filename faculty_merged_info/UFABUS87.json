                "An era of exploring the interactions of high-intensity, hard X-rays with matter has begun with the start-up of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Understanding how electrons in matter respond to ultra-intense X-ray radiation is essential for all applications. Here we reveal the nature of the electronic response in a free atom to unprecedented high-intensity, short-wavelength, high-fluence radiation (respectively 10 18 W cm\u2212 2, 1.5\u20130.6 nm,\u223c 10 5 X-ray photons per \u00c5 2). At this fluence, the neon target inevitably changes during the course of a single femtosecond-duration X-ray pulse\u2014by sequentially ejecting electrons\u2014to produce fully-stripped neon through absorption of six photons. Rapid photoejection of inner-shell electrons produces \u2018hollow\u2019atoms and an intensity-induced X-ray transparency. Such transparency, due to the presence of inner-shell vacancies, can be induced in all \u2026",
                "An internal-target technique was used to make the first measurements of the tensor analyzing power T 20 of electron-deuteron elastic scattering in the four-momentum-transfer range of 2\u20133 fm\u2212 1. Polarized deuterium atoms were confined within a storage cell in the VEPP-3 electron storage ring in Novosibirsk to achieve a total target thickness of 3\u00d7 10 12 cm\u2212 2, 15 times greater than was previously possible with an atomic-beam target alone. The results for T 20 are in agreement with reasonable models of the deuteron wave function.",
                "Measurements of 81Kr\/Kr in deep groundwater from the Nubian Aquifer (Egypt) were performed by a new laser\u2010based atom\u2010counting method. 81Kr ages range from \u223c2 \u00d7 105 to \u223c1 \u00d7 106 yr, correlate with 36Cl\/Cl ratios, and are consistent with lateral flow of groundwater from a recharge area near the Uweinat Uplift in SW Egypt. Low \u03b42H values of the 81Kr\u2010dated groundwater reveal a recurrent Atlantic moisture source during Pleistocene pluvial periods. These results indicate that the 81Kr method for dating old groundwater is robust and such measurements can now be applied to a wide range of hydrologic problems.",
                "The nonlinear absorption mechanisms of neon atoms to intense, femtosecond kilovolt x rays are investigated. The production of Ne 9+ is observed at x-ray frequencies below the Ne 8+, 1 s 2 absorption edge and demonstrates a clear quadratic dependence on fluence. Theoretical analysis shows that the production is a combination of the two-photon ionization of Ne 8+ ground state and a high-order sequential process involving single-photon production and ionization of transient excited states on a time scale faster than the Auger decay. We find that the nonlinear direct two-photon ionization cross section is orders of magnitude higher than expected from previous calculations.",
                "Laser manipulation of neutral atoms has been used to count individual krypton-85 and krypton-81 atoms present in a natural krypton gas sample with isotopic abundances in the range of 10\u221211and 10\u221213, respectively. This method of isotope trace analysis is free of contamination from other isotopes and elements and can be applied to several different isotope tracers for a wide range of applications. The demonstrated detection efficiency is 1 \u00d7 10\u22127. System improvements could increase the efficiency by many orders of magnitude."
