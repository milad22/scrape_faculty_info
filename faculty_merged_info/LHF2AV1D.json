                "Results on the superconductor to insulator transition in two-dimensional films are analyzed in terms of a coupling of the system to a dissipative bath. Upon lowering the temperature the parameter that controls this coupling becomes relevant and a wide range of metallic phase is recovered.",
                "We have measured carbon nanotube quantum dots with multiple electrostatic gates and used the resulting enhanced control to investigate a nanotube double quantum dot. Transport measurements reveal honeycomb charge stability diagrams as a function of two nearly independent gate voltages. The device can be tuned from weak to strong interdot tunnel-coupling regimes, and the transparency of the leads can be controlled independently. We extract values of energy-level spacings, capacitances, and interaction energies for this system. This ability to control electron interactions in the quantum regime in a molecular conductor is important for applications such as quantum computation."
