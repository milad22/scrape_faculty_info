                "Results on the superconductor to insulator transition in two-dimensional films are analyzed in terms of a coupling of the system to a dissipative bath. Upon lowering the temperature the parameter that controls this coupling becomes relevant and a wide range of metallic phase is recovered.",
                "We have measured carbon nanotube quantum dots with multiple electrostatic gates and used the resulting enhanced control to investigate a nanotube double quantum dot. Transport measurements reveal honeycomb charge stability diagrams as a function of two nearly independent gate voltages. The device can be tuned from weak to strong interdot tunnel-coupling regimes, and the transparency of the leads can be controlled independently. We extract values of energy-level spacings, capacitances, and interaction energies for this system. This ability to control electron interactions in the quantum regime in a molecular conductor is important for applications such as quantum computation."

Her thesis research was on phase transitions in two-dimensional superconductors. Prior to joining the physics faculty at Illinois, Professor Mason was a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where she collaborated with Professors Charles Marcus and Michael Tinkham on projects related to both carbon nanotubes and nanostructured superconductors. Professor Mason's research at Illinois focuses on how electrons behave in low-dimensional, correlated materials, where enhanced interactions are expected to give novel results. The research is relevant to a variety of technologies, including quantum communication, information storage, and qubit control in quantum computers. Professor Mason's current research focuses on the electronic behavior of materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, topological insulators, nanostructured superconductors, and other novel 1D or 2D systems. Typical measurements are of electronic transport at low temperatures. Typical projects include: (i) Tunneling experiments in carbon nanotubes, to study unusual correlated states such as Luttinger liquids, (ii) Studying emergent transport behavior of hybrid systems, e.g., superconductor-graphene, superconductor-toplogical insulator, graphene-PZT, and (iii) Creating planar arrays of superconducting islands, to control and understand collective phenomena in them.

Nadya Mason in Storied Illinois : Sharing the beauty and wonder of physics Physics professor Nadya Mason answers the Proust Questionnaire. Professor Nadya Mason's TED Talk on scientific curiosity Curious how stuff works? Do a hands-on experiment at home, says physicist Nadya Mason. She shows how you can demystify the world around you by tapping into your scientific curiosity\u2014and performs a few onstage experiments of her own using magnets, dollar bills, dry ice and more. In the Media In APS's : Nadya Mason on \"When a Superconductor Doesn't Act Like One\" There are times when superconductors\u2014materials through which electric current can travel without resistance and thus without losing energy\u2014don\u2019t live up to their reputation. Nadya Mason of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been making strides toward understanding when and how electron energy loss, or dissipation, arises in otherwise superconducting systems. She had planned to share this work in the Edward A. Bouchet Award Talk at the March Meeting of the American Physical Society earlier this month. (The meeting was canceled due to concerns about the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, but Modern technology is largely based on normal conductors, but electrical currents in these materials always dissipate some energy as heat. \u201cSuperconductors give us a great opportunity to save energy by reducing dissipation,\u201d Mason says. \u201cBut in order to use superconductors, we have to understand how dissipation affects them in particular, and how to minimize [dissipation] and control it.\u201d Accolades Diversity Nadya Mason makes Essence magazine's 'Woke 100' list! #90\u00a0 The former U.S. national team gymnast is now making a difference in the physics lab at the University of Illinois. Through her work and presence, she helps to fill the pipeline of women and minorities who pursue physics."
