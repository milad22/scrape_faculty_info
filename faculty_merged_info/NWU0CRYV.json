Allen BS - Physics St. Joseph's University PhD - Physics Iowa State University Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) encompasses a class of microscopes which utilize a similar manner of scanning a surface. However, the probes which are used with the microscopes are quite varied. For additional information about Scanning Probe Microscopy, visit the homepage of Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, California. The SPM laboratory at Appalachian State University is currently housed in Room 159c of Rankin Science. The SPM program is part of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. The department offers undergraduate degrees at the BS and BA levels, and a MS degree in Applied Physics. Undergraduate research is an integral part of the SPM program with students from many disciplines participating in research projects. The SPM facility at Appalachian utilizes the Nanoscope III by Digital Instruments which contains two probe systems: the Scanning Tunnel Microscope (STM) and the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The STM is capable of resolving details at the atomic level (on the order of 0.2 nm). However, it works best when imaging metal or semiconductor surfaces. Current research at the SPM facility is in the area of Microwear Analysis of Archaeological Tools. This research is in collaboration with Dr. Larry Kimball, Director, ASULAS, which is part of the Anthropology Department at Appalachian State University.
