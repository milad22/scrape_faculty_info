                "We demonstrate the existence of a spectrally narrow localized surface state, the so-called optical Tamm state, at the interface between one-dimensional magnetophotonic and nonmagnetic photonic crystals. The state is spectrally located inside the photonic band gaps of each of the photonic crystals comprising this magnetophotonic structure. This state is associated with a sharp transmission peak through the sample and is responsible for the substantial enhancement of the Faraday rotation for the corresponding wavelength. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.",
                "We study the optical properties of a photonic crystal interfaced with a uniform medium with the negative dielectric constant or with another photonic crystal. We show that, at such an interface, nonpropagating surface states may arise. These states result in a sharp feature in the transmission and reflection spectra of the system. We also show that interfacing magnetic and nonmagnetic photonic crystals gives rise to giant Faraday and Kerr effects.",
                "The variance of the Lyapunov exponent is calculated exactly in the one-dimensional Anderson model with random site energies distributed according to the Cauchy distribution. We find a new significant scaling parameter in the system, and derive an exact analytical criterion for single parameter scaling which differs from the commonly used condition of phase randomization. The results obtained are applied to the Kronig-Penney model with the potential in the form of periodically positioned \u03b4 functions with random strength.",
                "The propagation of surface electromagnetic waves along photonic crystal (PC) boundaries is examined. It is shown that in a number of cases, these are backward waves. The nature of surface electromagnetic states localized at the PC boundary is discussed; these states transfer no energy along the boundary (their tangential wave number is zero). An analogy with the well-known Tamm and Shockley surface states in solid state physics is drawn. It is shown that in the case of a PC, both types of states can be regarded as Tamm states. Experimental results on the observation of surface states are presented. A system using an external magnetic field to control a surface state is considered.",
                "We review quantum mechanical and optical pseudo-Hermitian systems with an emphasis on PT-symmetric systems important for optics and electrodynamics. One of the most interesting and much discussed consequences of PT symmetry is a phase transition under which the system eigenvalues lose their PT symmetry. We show that although this phase transition is difficult to realize experimentally, a similar transition can be observed in quasi-PT-symmetric systems. Other effects predicted for PT-symmetric systems are not specific for these systems and can be observed in ordinary fully passive systems.",
                "We measure microwave intensity inside and transmission through random samples of polystyrene spheres with different output reflectors. We show that with appropriate boundary conditions diffusion theory gives an excellent description of transport from the interior to the output surface of a sample. From these measurements we determine the transport mean free path and the surface reflectivities without additional assumptions regarding the interface or the scattering form factor. From a comparison with a measurement of the diffusion coefficient we determine the transport velocity and find that it is smaller than the velocity in the high-index material.",
                "By means of Monte Carlo simulations we show that there are two qualitatively different modes of localization of classical waves in 1D random periodic-on-average systems. States from pass bands and band edges of the underlying band structure demonstrate single parameter scaling with universal behavior. States from the interior of the band gaps do not have universal behavior and require two parameters to describe their scaling properties. The transition between these two types of behavior occurs in an extremely narrow region of frequencies. When the degree of disorder exceeds a certain critical value the single parameter scaling is restored for an entire band gap.",
                "The variance of the Lyapunov exponent is calculated exactly in the one-dimensional Anderson model with random site energies distributed according to the Cauchy distribution. We derive an exact analytical criterion for the validity of single-parameter scaling in this model. According to this criterion, states with energies within the conduction band of the underlying nonrandom system satisfy single-parameter scaling when the disorder is small enough. At the same time, single-parameter scaling is not valid for states close to band boundaries and those outside of the original spectrum, even in the case of small disorder. The results obtained are applied to the Kronig-Penney model with the potential in the form of periodically positioned \u03b4 functions with random strengths. We show that an increase in disorder can restore single-parameter scaling behavior for states within the band gaps."
