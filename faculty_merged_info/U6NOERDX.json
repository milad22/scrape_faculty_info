                "Using deep near\u2010infrared spectroscopy, Kriek et al. found that \u223c45% of massive galaxies at   have evolved stellar populations and little or no ongoing star formation. Here we determine the sizes of these quiescent galaxies using deep, high\u2010resolution images obtained with HST\/NIC2 and laser guide star (LGS)\u2013assisted Keck\/adaptive optics (AO). Considering that their median stellar mass is  , the galaxies are remarkably small, with a median effective radius   kpc. Galaxies of similar mass in the nearby universe have sizes of \u22485 kpc and average stellar densities that are 2 orders of magnitude lower than the   galaxies. These results extend earlier work at   and confirm previous studies at   that lacked spectroscopic redshifts and imaging of sufficient resolution to resolve the galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that fully assembled early\u2010type galaxies make up at most \u223c10% of the population of K\u2010selected quiescent \u2026"
