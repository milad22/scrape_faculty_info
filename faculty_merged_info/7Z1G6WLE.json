                "The Double Chooz experiment presents an indication of reactor electron antineutrino disappearance consistent with neutrino oscillations. An observed-to-predicted ratio of events of 0.944\u00b10.016 (stat)\u00b10.040 (syst) was obtained in 101 days of running at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France, with two 4.25 GW th reactors. The results were obtained from a single 10 m 3 fiducial volume detector located 1050 m from the two reactor cores. The reactor antineutrino flux prediction used the Bugey4 flux measurement after correction for differences in core composition. The deficit can be interpreted as an indication of a nonzero value of the still unmeasured neutrino mixing parameter sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13. Analyzing both the rate of the prompt positrons and their energy spectrum, we find sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.086\u00b10.041 (stat)\u00b10.030 (syst), or, at 90% CL, 0.017< sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13< 0.16.",
                "We present measurements of \u03bd \u03bc disappearance in K2K, the KEK to Kamioka long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. One-hundred and twelve beam-originated neutrino events are observed in the fiducial volume of Super-Kamiokande with an expectation of 158.1\u2212 8.6+ 9.2 events without oscillation. A distortion of the energy spectrum is also seen in 58 single-ring muonlike events with reconstructed energies. The probability that the observations are explained by the expectation for no neutrino oscillation is 0.0015%(4.3 \u03c3). In a two-flavor oscillation scenario, the allowed \u0394 m 2 region at sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8= 1 is between 1.9 and 3.5\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 at the 90% CL with a best-fit value of 2.8\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2.",

An event excess of 78.4\u00b128.5 events (2.8 \u03c3) is observed in the energy range 200< E \u03bd QE< 1250 MeV.

The data are consistent with antineutrino oscillations in the 0.01< \u0394 m 2< 1.0 eV 2 range and have some overlap with the evidence for antineutrino oscillations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector. All of the major backgrounds are constrained by in situ event measurements so nonoscillation explanations would need to invoke new anomalous background processes. The \u2026",
                "We present results for \u03bd \u03bc oscillation in the KEK to Kamioka (K2K) long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. K2K uses an accelerator-produced \u03bd \u03bc beam with a mean energy of 1.3 GeV directed at the Super-Kamiokande detector. We observed the energy-dependent disappearance of \u03bd \u03bc, which we presume have oscillated to \u03bd \u03c4. The probability that we would observe these results if there is no neutrino oscillation is 0.0050%(4.0 \u03c3).",
                "A high-statistics sample of charged-current muon neutrino scattering events collected with the MiniBooNE experiment is analyzed to extract the first measurement of the double differential cross section (d 2 \u03c3 d T \u03bc d cos\ufeff \u03b8 \u03bc) for charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) scattering on carbon. This result features minimal model dependence and provides the most complete information on this process to date. With the assumption of CCQE scattering, the absolute cross section as a function of neutrino energy (\u03c3 [E \u03bd]) and the single differential cross section (d \u03c3 d Q 2) are extracted to facilitate comparison with previous measurements. These quantities may be used to characterize an effective axial-vector form factor of the nucleon and to improve the modeling of low-energy neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. The results are relevant for experiments searching for neutrino oscillations.",

Several novel techniques have been developed to achieve significant reductions of the backgrounds and systematic uncertainties with respect to previous publications, whereas the efficiency of the signal has increased. The value of \u03b8 13 is measured to be sin 2 2\u03b8 13= 0.090\u2212 0.029+ 0.032 from a fit to the observed energy spectrum.

                "The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab reports results from an analysis of \u03bd e appearance data from 12.84\u00d7 10 20 protons on target in neutrino mode, an increase of approximately a factor of 2 over previously reported results. A \u03bd e charged-current quasielastic event excess of 381.2\u00b185.2 events (4.5 \u03c3) is observed in the energy range 200< E \u03bd QE< 1250 MeV.

                "The weak nucleon axial-vector form factor for quasielastic interactions is determined using neutrino interaction data from the K2K Scintillating Fiber detector in the neutrino beam at KEK. More than 12 000 events are analyzed, of which half are charged-current quasielastic interactions \u03bd \u03bc n\u2192 \u03bc\u2212 p occurring primarily in oxygen nuclei. We use a relativistic Fermi gas model for oxygen and assume the form factor is approximately a dipole with one parameter, the axial-vector mass M A, and fit to the shape of the distribution of the square of the momentum transfer from the nucleon to the nucleus. Our best fit result for M A= 1.20\u00b10.12 GeV. Furthermore, this analysis includes updated vector form factors from recent electron scattering experiments and a discussion of the effects of the nucleon momentum on the shape of the fitted distributions."
