                "Magnetism and ferroelectricity are essential to many forms of current technology, and the quest for multiferroic materials, where these two phenomena are intimately coupled, is of great technological and fundamental importance. Ferroelectricity and magnetism tend to be mutually exclusive and interact weakly with each other when they coexist. The exciting new development is the discovery that even a weak magnetoelectric interaction can lead to spectacular cross-coupling effects when it induces electric polarization in a magnetically ordered state. Such magnetic ferroelectricity, showing an unprecedented sensitivity to ap plied magnetic fields, occurs in'frustrated magnets' with competing interactions between spins and complex magnetic orders. We summarize key experimental findings and the current theoretical understanding of these phenomena, which have great potential for tuneable multifunctional devices.",
                "The complete phase diagram of a \u201ccolossal\u201d magnetoresistance material (La 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3) was obtained for the first time through magnetization and resistivity measurements over a broad range of temperatures and concentrations. Near x= 0.50, the ground state changes from a ferromagnetic (FM) conductor to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator, leading to a strongly first order AFM transition with supercooling of\u223c 30% T N at x= 0.50. An unexpectedly large magnetoresistance is seen at low temperatures in the FM phase, and is largely attributed to unusual domain wall scattering.",
                "A detailed study of doped LaMn O 3 with fixed carrier concentration reveals a direct relationship between the Curie temperature T c and the average ionic radius of the La site< r A>, which is varied by substituting different rare earth ions for La. With decreasing< r A>, magnetic order and significant magnetoresistance occur at lower temperatures with increasing thermal hysteresis, and the magnitude of the magnetoresistance increases dramatically. These results show that the notion of \u201cdouble exchange\u201d must be generalized to include changes in the Mn-Mn electronic hopping parameter as a result of changes in the Mn-O-Mn bond angle.",
                "Ferroelectric and magnetic materials are a time-honoured subject of study and have led to some of the most important technological advances to date. Magnetism and ferroelectricity are involved with local spins and off-centre structural distortions, respectively. These two seemingly unrelated phenomena can coexist in certain unusual materials, termed multiferroics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Despite the possible coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism, a pronounced interplay between these properties has rarely been observed 6, 12. This has prevented the realization of multiferroic devices offering such functionality 13. Here, we report a striking interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in the multiferroic TbMn 2 O 5, demonstrated by a highly reproducible electric polarization reversal and permanent polarization imprint that are both actuated by an applied magnetic field. Our results point to new device \u2026",
                "The magnetoresistance (MR) and the field dependent magnetization have been systematically examined in the low temperature ferromagnetic metallic state of single crystal and polycrystalline La 2\/3 Sr 1\/3 MnO 3. We find that the intrinsic negative MR in single crystal is due to the suppression of spin fluctuations, and magnetic domain boundaries do not dominate the scattering process. In contrast, we demonstrate that the MR in the polycrystalline samples exhibits two distinct regions: large MR at low fields dominated by spin-polarized tunneling between grains and high field MR which is remarkably temperature independent from 5 to 280 K.",
                "Colossal magnetoresistance 1\u2014an unusually large change of resistivity observed in certain materials following application of magnetic field\u2014has been extensively researched in ferromagnetic perovskite manganites. But it remains unclear why the magnetoresistive response increases dramatically when the Curie temperature (T C) is reduced. In these materials, T C varies sensitively with changing chemical pressure; this can be achieved by introducing trivalent rare-earth ions of differing size into the perovskite structure 2, 3, 4, without affecting the valency of the Mn ions. The chemical pressure modifies local structural parameters such as the Mn\u2013O bond distance and Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn bond angle, which directly influence the case of electron hopping between Mn ions (that is, the electronic bandwidth). But these effects cannot satisfactorily explain the dependence of magnetoresistance on T C. Here we demonstrate, using \u2026",
                "Unidirectional electric current flow, such as that found in a diode, is essential for modern electronics. It usually occurs at asymmetric interfaces such as p-n junctions or metal\/semiconductor interfaces with Schottky barriers. We report on a diode effect associated with the direction of bulk electric polarization in BiFeO3: a ferroelectric with a small optical gap edge of \u223c2.2 electron volts. We found that bulk electric conduction in ferroelectric monodomain BiFeO3 crystals is highly nonlinear and unidirectional. This diode effect switches its direction when the electric polarization is flipped by an external voltage. A substantial visible-light photovoltaic effect is observed in BiFeO3 diode structures. These results should improve understanding of charge conduction mechanisms in leaky ferroelectrics and advance the design of switchable devices combining ferroelectric, electronic, and optical functionalities.",
                "Metal oxides constitute one of the most amazing classes of materials with a wide range of properties. They exhibit a variety of phenomena, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and superconductivity. A new aspect of metal oxides--colossal magnetoresistance exhibited by certain manganese oxides, in particular rare earth manganates of perovskite structure--has received much attention in the last four years. Some of these oxides show 100% magnetoresistance and have much potential for technological applications. Previously this phenomenon was found only in layered and granular metallic materials. Studies of colossal magnetoresistance have led to the discovery of many other new phenomena and properties such as charge ordering and orbital ordering. In view of the importance of colossal magnetoresistance, charge ordering and related phenomena exhibited by oxides to the physics and chemistry of solid materials, it is necessary and timely to have a book dealing with these topics. This book begins with a review of the subject followed by contributions from a number of experts which cover the present status of the subject.",
                "The propensity of systems of charge and spin to form, under certain conditions,\u2018stripe\u2019phases has recently attracted much attention, as it has been suggested that dynamically fluctuating stripe phases may be of central importance for an understanding of the physics of high-temperature superconductors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. A related phenomenon\u2014static charge stripes\u2014characterizes 6 the insulating antiferromagnetic ground state of the manganese oxides, a class of materials which (like the copper oxide superconductors) have a perovskite structure, and are notable for their extraordinary electronic and magnetic properties, such as colossal magnetoresistance and charge ordering 7, 8. Here we report a different pattern of charge localization in the charge-ordered phase of the manganese oxide La 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3 (x\u2a7e 0.5). This pattern takes the form of extremely stable pairs of Mn 3+ O 6 stripes, with associated large lattice \u2026",
                "The unusual magnetic properties of La 0.5 Ca 0.5 MnO 3 were found to be associated with structural and magnetic ordering phenomena, resulting from the close interplay between charge, orbital, and magnetic ordering. Analysis of synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction data indicates that the anomalous and hysteretic behavior of the lattice parameters occurring between T C\u223c 225 K and T N\u223c 155 K is due to the development of a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion of the MnO 6 octahedra, the d z 2> orbitals being oriented perpendicular to the orthorhombic b axis. We observed an unusual broadening of the x-ray Bragg reflections throughout this temperature region, suggesting that this process occurs in stages. Below T N, the development of well-defined satellite peaks in the x-ray patterns, associated with a transverse modulation with q=[1\/2-\u025b, 0, 0], indicates that quasicommensurate (\u025b\u223c 0) orbital ordering \u2026"
