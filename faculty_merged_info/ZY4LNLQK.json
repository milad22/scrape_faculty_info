Dienes Professor of Physics and Mathematics office:\u00a0PAS 420C 626-9385 dienes@physics.arizona.edu Ph.D., 1991, Cornell Univerisity New ideas for physics beyond the Standard Model, including supersymmetry, grand unification, and ultimately string theory. Particular interests include string model-building, the possibility of large extra spacetime dimensions, alternatives to weak-scale supersymmetry, and the role that modern developments in string theory can play in altering our traditional views of physics at high energy scales. By exploring the interplay between string theory and particle physics, the goal is to understand the novel ways in which the two can enrich each other and ultimately provide new and unexpected perspectives on physics beyond the Standard Model."
