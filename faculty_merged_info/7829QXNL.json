                " Doppler measurements from Subaru and Keck have revealed radial velocity variations in the  , G0 IV star HD 149026 consistent with a Saturn\u2010mass planet in a 2.8766 day orbit. Photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory have detected three complete transit events with depths of 0.003 mag at the predicted times of conjunction. HD 149026 is now the second\u2010brightest star with a transiting extrasolar planet. The mass of the star, based on interpolation of stellar evolutionary models, is   M\u2299; together with the Doppler amplitude   m s\u22121, we derive a planet mass   and orbital radius 0.042 AU. HD 149026 is chromospherically inactive and metal\u2010rich with spectroscopically derived  ,   K,  , and   km s\u22121. Based on Teff and the stellar luminosity of 2.72 L\u2299, we derive a stellar radius of 1.45 R\u2299. Modeling of the three photometric transits provides an orbital inclination of   and (including the uncertainty in the stellar radius \u2026",
                "The recent discoveries of massive planets on ultra-wide orbits of HR 8799 and Fomalhaut present a new challenge for planet formation theorists. Our goal is to figure out which of three giant planet formation mechanisms\u2014core accretion (with or without migration), scattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability\u2014could be responsible for Fomalhaut b, HR 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discovered in the future. This paper presents the results of numerical experiments comparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible mechanism in model A star, G star, and M star disks. First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming beyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable conditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates that planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such as HR 8799 \u2026",
                "We have created specialized target lists for radial velocity surveys that are biased toward stars that (1) possess planets and (2) are easiest to observe with current detection techniques. We use a procedure that uniformly estimates fundamental stellar properties of Tycho 2 stars, with errors, using spline functions of broadband photometry and proper motion found in Hipparcos\/Tycho 2 and 2MASS. We provide estimates of   and distance for   Tycho 2 stars that lack trigonometric distances. For stars that appear to be FGK dwarfs, we also derive [Fe\/H] and identify unresolved binary systems with mass ratios  . For FGK dwarfs with photometric error   or  , our temperature model gives a 1 \u03c3 error of   K and our metallicity model gives a 1 \u03c3 error of   dex. The binarity model can be used to remove 70% of doubles with   from a magnitude\u2010limited sample of dwarfs at a cost of cutting 20% of the sample. Our estimates of distance \u2026",

                "Although there has yet been no undisputed discovery of a still-forming planet embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, the cleared inner holes of transitional disks may be signposts of young planets. Here, we show that the subset of accreting transitional disks with wide, optically thin inner holes of 15 AU or more can only be sculpted by multiple planets orbiting inside each hole. Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the origins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner holes where single planets open only narrow gaps. Second, the confined, non-axisymmetric accretion flows produced by multiple planets provide a way for an arbitrary amount of mass transfer to occur through an apparently optically thin hole without overproducing infrared excess flux. Rather than assuming that the gas and dust in the hole are evenly and axisymmetrically distributed, one can construct \u2026",
                "The N2K (\u201cnext 2000\u201d) consortium is carrying out a distributed observing campaign with the Keck, Magellan, and Subaru telescopes, as well as the automatic photometric telescopes of Fairborn Observatory, in order to search for short\u2010period gas giant planets around metal\u2010rich stars.

                "As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the United States, evidence is mounting that racial and ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are bearing a disproportionate burden of illness and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter\u2019s integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race\/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January 1\u2013April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African \u2026",
                "We report the detection of five Jovian\u2010mass planets orbiting high\u2010metallicity stars. Four of these stars were first observed as part of the N2K program, and exhibited low rms velocity scatter after three consecutive observations. However, follow\u2010up observations over the last 3 years now reveal the presence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days to a few years. HD 11506 is a G0 V star with a planet of   in a 3.85 yr orbit. HD 17156 is a G0 V star with a 3.12 MJup planet in a 21.2 day orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been detected. HD 125612 is a G3 V star with a planet of   in a 1.4 yr orbit. HD 170469 is a G5 IV star with a planet of   in a 3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8 V star with planet of 1.08 MJup in a 142 \u2026",
                "To date, there is no core accretion simulation that can successfully account for the formation of Uranus or Neptune within the observed 2\u20133 Myr lifetimes of protoplanetary disks. Since solid accretion rate is directly proportional to the available planetesimal surface density, one way to speed up planet formation is to take a full accounting of all the planetesimal-forming solids present in the solar nebula. By combining a viscously evolving protostellar disk with a kinetic model of ice formation, which includes not just water but methane, ammonia, CO and 54 minor ices, we calculate the solid surface density of a possible giant planet-forming solar nebula as a function of heliocentric distance and time. Our results can be used to provide the starting planetesimal surface density and evolving solar nebula conditions for core accretion simulations, or to predict the composition of planetesimals as a function of radius.
