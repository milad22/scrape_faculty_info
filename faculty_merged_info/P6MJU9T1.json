                "Bruce Sherwood, PH.D. Bruce Sherwood, PH.D. Visiting Scholar bruce.sherwood@unt.edu https:\/\/brucesherwood.net\/ I focus on improving and updating the calculus-based introductory physics course taken by science and engineering students. One component of this work is the inclusion in the course of an introduction to computational modeling, which is now central to all of STEM, and I am the lead developer of the VPython 3D computational environment that is used by students in the course. VPython is also used by physics faculty to create lecture demo programs, and by researchers who need an easy way to create 3D animations."
