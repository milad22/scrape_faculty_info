                "The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high-quality graphene and graphene devices. As the large-scale graphene films synthesized so far are typically polycrystalline, it is important to characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by ambient chemical vapour deposition on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between coalescing grains affect graphene\u2019s electronic properties. The graphene grains show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant Raman \u2018D\u2019peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene \u2026",
                "This chapter is a review of the application of Raman spectroscopy in characterizing the properties of graphene, both exfoliated and synthesized, and graphene-based materials such as graphene-oxide. Graphene is a 2-dimensional honeycomb lattice of sp2-bonded carbon atoms and has received enormous interest because of its host of interesting material properties and technological potentials. Raman spectroscopy (and Raman imaging) has become a powerful, noninvasive method to characterize graphene and related materials. A large amount of information such as disorder, edge and grain boundaries, thickness, doping, strain and thermal conductivity of graphene can be learned from the Raman spectrum and its behavior under varying physical conditions. In particular, this chapter will discuss Raman characterization of graphene with artificial disorder generated by irradiations",
                "Graphene with a large area was synthesized on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition under ambient pressure. A 4\u2033 \u00d7 4\u2033 graphene film was transferred onto a 6\u2033 Si wafer with a thermally grown oxide film. Raman mapping indicates monolayer graphene dominates the transferred graphene film. Gas sensors were fabricated on a 4 mm \u00d7 3 mm size graphene film with a 1 nm palladium film deposited for hydrogen detection. Hydrogen in air with concentrations in 0.0025\u20131% (25\u201310,000 ppm) was used to test graphene-based gas sensors. The gas sensors based on palladium-decorated graphene films show high sensitivity, fast response and recovery, and can be used with multiple cycles. The mechanism of hydrogen detection is also discussed.",
                "A rational yet scalable solution phase method has been established, for the first time, to obtain n-type Bi2Te3 ultrathin nanowires with an average diameter of 8 nm in high yield (up to 93%). Thermoelectric properties of bulk pellets fabricated by compressing the nanowire powder through spark plasma sintering have been investigated. Compared to the current commercial n-type Bi2Te3-based bulk materials, our nanowire devices exhibit an enhanced ZT of 0.96 peaked at 380 K due to a significant reduction of thermal conductivity derived from phonon scattering at the nanoscale interfaces in the bulk pellets, which corresponds to a 13% enhancement compared to that of the best n-type commercial Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 single crystals (\u223c0.85) and is comparable to the best reported result of n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 sample (ZT = 1.04) fabricated by the hot pressing of ball-milled powder.

                "We report on electronic properties of graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper then transferred to SiO2\/Si. Wafer-scale (up to 4 in.) graphene films have been synthesized, consisting dominantly of monolayer graphene as indicated by spectroscopic Raman mapping. Low temperature transport measurements are performed on microdevices fabricated from such CVD graphene, displaying ambipolar field effect (with on\/off ratio \u223c5 and carrier mobilities up to \u223c3000\u2002cm2\/V\u2009s) and \u201chalf-integer\u201d quantum Hall effect, a hall-mark of intrinsic electronic properties of monolayer graphene. We also observe weak localization and extract information about phase coherence and scattering of carriers.",
                "Improving energy\/fuel efficiency by converting waste heat into electricity using thermoelectric materials is of great interest due to its simplicity and reliability. However, many thermoelectric materials are composed of either toxic or scarce elements. Here, we report the experimental realization of using nontoxic and abundant copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) nanocrystals for potential thermoelectric applications. The CZTS nanocrystals can be synthesized in large quantities from solution phase reaction and compressed into robust bulk pellets through spark plasma sintering and hot press while still maintaining nanoscale grain size inside. Electrical and thermal measurements have been performed from 300 to 700 K to understand the electron and phonon transports. Extra copper doping during the nanocrystal synthesis introduces a significant improvement in the performance."
