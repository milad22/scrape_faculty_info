As the Director of Undergraduate Affairs Ryan supports student development and success at all stages of the Carnegie Mellon undergraduate physics program. Ryan works closely with physics students as they navigate their undergraduate experience and provides individualized support to assist physics students as they pursue their goals. In the classroom Ryan cultivates an inclusive environment so that all students can be active and engaged participants in learning. Ryan works to encourage students to think about how they think and to think about how they learn. Through teaching, advising, and by fostering meaningful extracurricular activities Ryan aims to help undergraduate physics students at Carnegie Mellon University meet their full potential. T.S.
