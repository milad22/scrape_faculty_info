                "We construct the quantum versions of the monodromy matrices of KdV theory. The traces of these quantum monodromy matrices, which will be called as \u201cT-operators,\u201d act in highest weight Virasoro modules. TheT-operators depend on the spectral parameter \u03bb and their expansion around \u03bb=\u221e generates an infinite set of commuting Hamiltonians of the quantum KdV system. TheT-operators can be viewed as the continuous field theory versions of the commuting transfermatrices of integrable lattice theory. In particular, we show that for the values  ,n=1,2,3 .... of the Virasoro central charge the eigenvalues of theT-operators satisfy a closed system of functional equations sufficient for determining the spectrum. For the ground-state eigenvalue these functional equations are equivalent to those of the massless Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the minimal conformal field theoryM 2,2n+3; in general \u2026",
                "This paper is a direct continuation of [1] where we began the study of the integrable structures in Conformal Field Theory.  We show here how to construct the operators ${\\bf Q}_{\\pm}(\\lambda)$ which act in the highest weight Virasoro module and commute for different values of the parameter \u03bb. These operators appear to be the CFT analogs of the Q - matrix of Baxter [2], in particular they satisfy  Baxter's famous T- Q equation. We also show that under natural assumptions about analytic properties of the operators   as the functions of \u03bb the Baxter's relation allows one to derive the nonlinear integral equations of Destri-de Vega (DDV) [3] for the eigenvalues of the Q-operators. We then use the DDV equation to obtain the  asymptotic expansions of the Q - operators at large \u03bb; it is remarkable that unlike the expansions of the T operators of  [1], the asymptotic series for  Q(\u03bb) contains the \u201cdual\u201d nonlocal Integrals of \u2026",
                "We propose an explicit expression for vacuum expectation values <eia\u03d5> of the exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model. Our expression agrees both with semi-classical results in the sine-Gordon theory and with perturbative calculations in the massive Thirring model. We use this expression to make new predictions about the large-distance asymptotic form of the two-point correlation function in the XXZ spin chain.",
                "In this paper we fill some gaps in the arguments of our previous papers [1,2]. In particular, we give a proof that the L operators of Conformal Field Theory indeed satisfy the defining relations of the Yang\u2013Baxter algebra. Among other results we  present a derivation of the functional relations satisfied by T and Q operators and a proof of the basic analyticity assumptions for these operators used in [1,2].",
                "We develop a method of computing the excited state energies in Integrable Quantum Field Theories (IQFT) in finite geometry, with the spatial coordinate compactified on a circle of circumference R. The IQFT \u201ccommuting transfer matrices\u201d introduced earlier [Commun. Math. Phys. 177 (1996) 381] for Conformal Field Theories (CFT) are generalized to non-conformal IQFT obtained by perturbing CFT with the operator \u03a61,3. We study the models in which the fusion relations for these \u201ctransfer matrices\u201d truncate and provide closed integral equations which generalize the equations of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to excited states. The explicit calculations are done for the first excited state in the \u201cscaling Lee-Yang model\u201d."
