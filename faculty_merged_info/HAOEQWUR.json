                "Top Kristina Launey Assistant Professor Ph.D., 2003 - Louisiana State University 211B\u00a0Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. 225-578-0351 kristina@phys.lsu.edu Personal Web Page Curriculum Vitae Theoretical nuclear\u00a0physics and astrophysics My main research focuses on strong interaction physics ranging from modeling atomic\n                  nuclei from first principles (or \"ab initio\" ), through electroweak- and strong-interaction driven nuclear reactions, to further\n                  understanding the nuclear interaction from the underlying foundation of Quantum Chromodynamics\n                  (QCD). Indeed, how the strong force bonds protons and neutrons into a plethora of\n                  nuclei is still not well understood, and presents a foremost challenge. The reason\n                  is that modeling the nucleus from first principles, which holds predictive power,\n                  is a computationally intense task and faces the difficulty, first, of strong interactions\n                  that prohibit perturbative treatments and, second, of accounting for emergent phenomena.\n                  Our research addresses some of these challenges by taking advantage of symmetries\n                  that dominate the many-body nuclear dynamics, inter-nucleon interaction and its effective\n                  counterparts in nuclear medium. It targets two overarching goals: Fundamentals of nuclear physics , namely, further advancing our knowledge of the complex nuclear structure and probing\n                     fundamental properties of the inter-nucleon interaction; Applications to nuclei-driven processes in natur e, including nuclear structure and reactions of importance to astrophysics, neutrino\n                     physics and energy-related applied physics. Recent studies include: no-core symplectic shell model (NCSpM) for large deformation\n                  and alpha-cluster substructures exemplified by the challenging Hoyle state in 12 C; symmetry-adapted no-core shell model (SA-NCSM) for ab initio nuclear structure with its first reach of intermediate-mass nuclei (isotopes of Ne,\n                  Mg, Al, and Si); spectral distribution theory (SDT) for effective interactions and\n                  for level densities needed as input to nuclear reactions for medium-mass nuclei above 56 Ni; similarity renormalization group (SRG) for effective interactions; R-matrix coupled-channel\n                  method (CCM) for nuclear reactions, such as proton-capture reactions of importance\n                  to Ne-Na\/Mg-Al chains in AGB stars and X-ray burst nucleosynthesis; electron and neutrino\n                  scattering; exact pairing of importance to density functional theory studies; quantum\n                  information applications with a focus on Shannon and von Neumann entropies of nuclear\n                  systems; group-theoretical approaches involving symplectic Sp(3,R) & Sp(2) groups\n                  and SU(3) group.
