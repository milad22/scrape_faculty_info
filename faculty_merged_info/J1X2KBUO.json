                "Semiconducting molybdenum disulfphide has emerged as an attractive material for novel nanoscale optoelectronic devices due to its reduced dimensionality and large direct bandgap. Since optoelectronic devices require electron-hole generation\/recombination, it is important to be able to fabricate ambipolar transistors to investigate charge transport both in the conduction band and in the valence band. Although n-type transistor operation for single-layer and few-layer MoS 2 with gold source and drain contacts was recently demonstrated, transport in the valence band has been elusive for solid-state devices. Here we show that a multi-layer MoS 2 channel can be hole-doped by palladium contacts, yielding MoS 2 p-type transistors. When two different materials are used for the source and drain contacts, for example hole-doping Pd and electron-doping Au, the Schottky junctions formed at the MoS 2 contacts \u2026",
                "We report measurements of mm-wavelength radiation from two-dimensional arrays of underdamped Josephson junctions. All of our samples emit coherently in a novel synchronized state, which is triggered by a resonance in the array structure. Measurements of the detected power as a function of the number N of active junctions show a threshold, suggesting population inversion. Above threshold, the power scales with N 2 up to an array size bigger than the free-space radiation wavelength. The highest measured conversion efficiency from dc to ac power is about 17%. Our data are consistent with stimulated emission causing coherence and cannot be explained by existing classical coupling mechanisms.",
                "We report an experimental method that clearly determines the sensing mechanism of carbon-nanotube field effect transistors. The nanotube\/electrode contacts are covered with a thick and long passivation layer that hinders their exposure to chemicals in a controlled fashion, leaving only the midsection of the nanotube exposed. In the case of nitrogen dioxide, a considerably delayed response is fully consistent with the diffusion of the gas through the passivation layer. The results clearly indicate that nitrogen dioxide detection is due to changes at the interfaces between the nanotube and the electrodes and not to molecules adsorbed on the nanotube surface.",
                "Gas sensing in carbon nanotubes is still poorly understood. Possible mechanisms are charge transfer between adsorbed gas molecules and the nanotubes or gas-induced changes at the interface between the nanotubes and their metal contacts. For carbon nanotube networks, it is also important to understand how defects and junctions formed by crossing nanotubes affect adsorption. Previous work demonstrates that for devices made with a single carbon nanotube, the response was mainly due to modifications at the nanotube\/metal contact interfaces rather than molecular adsorption on the nanotube. Here it is shown that in networks of carbon nanotubes the gas sensitivity is due to both the nanotube\/metal contacts and the carbon nanotube network. The network effects are dominated by gas-induced changes in nanotube\/nanotube junctions, rather than gas adsorption on regions of the nanotubes away from the \u2026",
                "We have measured the complex ac magnetic susceptibility of unshunted Josephson-junction arrays as a function of temperature T, amplitude of the excitation field h ac, and external magnetic field H dc. For small h ac Meissner screening occurs. For larger h ac, however, the screening is reentrant in T. This reentrance is not thermodynamic but dynamic and arises from the paramagnetic contribution of multijunction loops. This result gives an alternative explanation of the paramagnetic Meissner effect observed in granular superconductors. Experimental results are in agreement with a simplified model based on a single loop containing four junctions.",
                "Light absorption in graphene causes a large change in electron temperature due to the low electronic heat capacity and weak electron\u2013phonon coupling 1, 2, 3. This property makes graphene a very attractive material for hot-electron bolometers in the terahertz frequency range. Unfortunately, the weak variation of electrical resistance with temperature results in limited responsivity for absorbed power. Here, we show that, due to quantum confinement, quantum dots of epitaxial graphene on SiC exhibit an extraordinarily high variation of resistance with temperature (higher than 430 M\u03a9 K\u2212 1 below 6 K), leading to responsivities of 1\u00d7 10 10 V W\u2212 1, a figure that is five orders of magnitude higher than other types of graphene hot-electron bolometer. The high responsivity, combined with an extremely low electrical noise-equivalent power (\u223c 2\u00d7 10\u2212 16 W Hz\u2212 1\/2 at 2.5 K), already places our bolometers well above \u2026",
                "We study field-effect transistors made of single-and double-walled carbon nanotube networks for applications as memory devices. The transfer characteristics of the transistors exhibit a reproducible hysteresis which enables their use as nano-sized memory cells with operations faster than 10 ms, endurance longer than 10+ 4 cycles and charge retention of a few hours in air. We propose water enhanced charge trapping at the SiO 2\/air interface close to the nanotubes as the dominant mechanism for charge storage. We show that charge storage can be improved by limiting exposure of the device to air.",
                "We present experimental and theoretical results showing that the distributed electromagnetic environment of a Josephson junction array can cause the junctions in the array to synchronize. Based on our experimental results and our distributed array model, we find that an external load is not necessary for junction synchronization. Also, we show that the high-frequency performance of an array can be significantly better than the performance of a single isolated junction.",
                "The paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME) measured in high-T C granular superconductors has been attributed to the presence of \u03c0 junctions between the grains. Here we present measurements of complex ac magnetic susceptibility from two-dimensional arrays of conventional (non-\u03c0) Nb\/Al\/AlOx\/Nb Josephson junctions. We measured the susceptibility as a function of the temperature T, the ac amplitude of the excitation field h ac and the external magnetic field H dc. The experiments show a strong paramagnetic contribution from the multijunction loops, which manifests itself as a reentrant screening at low temperature, for values of h ac higher than 50 mOe. A highly simplified model, based on a single loop containing four junctions, accounts for this paramagnetic contribution and the range of parameters in which it appears. This model offers an alternative explanation of PME that does not involve \u03c0 junctions."
