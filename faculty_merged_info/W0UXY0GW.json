                "Comprehensive wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys of the sky have played a key role in astronomy, leading to fundamental new breakthroughs in our understanding of the Solar System; our Milky Way Galaxy and its constituent stars and gas; the nature, properties, and evolution of galaxies; and the universe as a whole. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which started routine operations in 2000 April, has carried out imaging and spectroscopy over roughly 1\/3 of the Celestial Sphere. SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5 m wide-field telescope (Gunn et al. 2006), instrumented with a sequence of sophisticated imagers and spectrographs. The SDSS has gone through a series of stages. SDSS-I (York et al. 2000), which was in operation through 2005, focused on a \u201cLegacy\u201d survey of five-band imaging (using what was at the time the largest camera ever used in optical astronomy; Gunn et al. 1998) and \u2026",
                "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) started observations in 1998 and has completed three different phases. The data collected includes optical imaging of most of the northern high Galactic latitude sky as well as optical and nearinfrared spectroscopy of over 3.5 million stars, galaxies, and quasars. These observations all used the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO; Gunn et al. 2006). This paper describes SDSS-IV, the fourth phase, and how it builds upon and extends both the infrastructure and scientific legacy of the previous generations of surveys.",
                "It is now 16 years since the first data release from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). This Early Data Release, or EDR, occurred in 2001 June (Stoughton et al. 2002). Since this time, annual data releases from SDSS have become part of the landscape of astronomy, populating databases used by thousands of astronomers worldwide (Raddick et al. 2014a, 2014b), and making the SDSS\u2019s 2.5 mSloan Foundation Telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) one of the most productive observatories in the world (Madrid & Macchetto 2009). This paper describes the 14th public data release from SDSS, or DR14, released on 2017 July 31. The SDSS has completed three phases and is currently in its fourth phase. SDSS-I and-II conducted a Legacy survey of galaxies and quasars (York et al. 2000), the SDSS-II Supernova Survey (Frieman et al. 2008; Sako et al. 2014), and conducted observations of stars for the \u2026",
                "Following the selection of The Gravitational Universe by ESA, and the successful flight of LISA Pathfinder, the LISA Consortium now proposes a 4 year mission in response to ESA's call for missions for L3. The observatory will be based on three arms with six active laser links, between three identical spacecraft in a triangular formation separated by 2.5 million km.LISA is an all-sky monitor and will offer a wide view of a dynamic cosmos using Gravitational Waves as new and unique messengers to unveil The Gravitational Universe. It provides the closest ever view of the infant Universe at TeV energy scales, has known sources in the form of verification binaries in the Milky Way, and can probe the entire Universe, from its smallest scales near the horizons of black holes, all the way to cosmological scales. The LISA mission will scan the entire sky as it follows behind the Earth in its orbit, obtaining both polarisations of the Gravitational Waves simultaneously, and will measure source parameters with astrophysically relevant sensitivity in a band from below  Hz to above  Hz.",
                "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) data releases began with the Early Data Release, or EDR, in 2001 June (Stoughton et al. 2002) and have been heavily used by astronomers and the broader public since that time (Raddick et al. 2014a, 2014b). Here, we present the 15th public data release from SDSS, or DR15, made publicly available on 2018 December 10.SDSS has been marked by four phases so far, with plans for a fifth. Details are available in the papers describing SDSS-I (EDR, DR1\u2013DR5; York et al. 2000), SDSS-II (DR6\u2013DR7; Frieman et al. 2008; Yanny et al. 2009), SDSS-III (DR8\u2013DR12; Eisenstein et al. 2011), and SDSS-IV (DR13\u2013DR15;",
                "LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is designed to observe gravitational waves from violent events in the Universe in a frequency range from 10\u2212 4 to 10\u2212 1 Hz which is totally inaccessible to ground based experiments. It uses highly stabilised laser light (Nd: YAG, \u03bb= 1.064 \u03bcm) in a Michelson\u2010type interferometer arrangement.",
                "Advanced LIGO detectors at Hanford and Livingston made two confirmed and one marginal detection of binary black holes during their first observing run. The first event, GW150914, was from the merger of two black holes much heavier that those whose masses have been estimated so far, indicating a formation scenario that might differ from \u201cordinary\u201d stellar evolution. One possibility is that these heavy black holes resulted from a previous merger. When the progenitors of a black hole binary merger result from previous mergers, they should (on average) merge later, be more massive, and have spin magnitudes clustered around a dimensionless spin\u223c 0.7. Here we ask the following question: can gravitational-wave observations determine whether merging black holes were born from the collapse of massive stars (\u201cfirst generation\u201d), rather than being the end product of earlier mergers (\u201csecond generation\u201d)? We \u2026",
                "During a galaxy merger, the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in each galaxy is thought to sink to the center of the potential and form an SMBH binary; this binary can eject stars via three-body scattering, bringing the SMBHs ever closer. In a static spherical galaxy model, the binary stalls at a separation of about a parsec after ejecting all the stars in its loss cone\u2014this is the well-known final parsec problem. Earlier work has shown that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxy models are key in refilling the loss cone at a high enough rate to prevent the black holes from stalling. However, the evolution of binary SMBHs has never been explored in axisymmetric galaxies, so it is not clear if the final parsec problem persists in these systems. Here we use a suite of direct N-body simulations to follow SMBH binary evolution in galaxy models with a range of ellipticity. For the first time, we show that mere axisymmetry can solve \u2026",
                "The evolution of a stellar bar transforms not only the galactic disc, but also the host dark matter halo. We present high-resolution, fully self-consistent N-body simulations that clearly demonstrate that dark matter halo central density cusps flatten as the bar torques the halo. This effect is independent of the bar formation mode and occurs even for rather short bars. The halo and bar evolution is mediated by resonant interactions between orbits in the halo and the bar pattern speed, as predicted by linear Hamiltonian perturbation theory. The bar lengthens and slows as it loses angular momentum, a process that occurs even in rather warm discs. We demonstrate that the bar and halo response can be critically underestimated for experiments that are unable to resolve the relevant resonant dynamics; this occurs when the phase space in the resonant region is undersampled or plagued by noise.",
                "We construct numerical models of mildly triaxial elliptical galaxies with central density cusps. Using a technique we call \u201cadiabatic squeezing,\u201d we begin with a spherical   Hernquist model and apply a drag to the velocities of the particles along each principal axis. The final models are stable in isolation, preserving their density structure and figure shape over many dynamical timescales. The density profile and axial ratios compare well to the observed properties of elliptical galaxies. The orbital structure of these models show a mixture of tubes, boxes, and boxlets, as expected for triaxial systems, with very few chaotic orbits. These N\u2010body realizations of cuspy triaxial galaxies provide a basis for the study of dynamical evolution of elliptical galaxies."
