                "We report terahertz (THz) light-induced second harmonic generation, in superconductors with inversion symmetry that forbid even-order nonlinearities. The THz second harmonic emission vanishes above the superconductor critical temperature and arises from precession of twisted Anderson pseudospins at a multicycle, THz driving frequency that is not allowed by equilibrium symmetry. We explain the microscopic physics by a dynamical symmetry breaking principle at sub-THz-cycle by using quantum kinetic modeling of the interplay between strong THz-lightwave nonlinearity and pulse propagation. The resulting nonzero integrated pulse area inside the superconductor leads to light-induced nonlinear supercurrents due to subcycle Cooper pair acceleration, in contrast to dc-biased superconductors, which can be controlled by the band structure and THz driving field below the superconducting gap.",
                "A grand challenge underlies the entire field of topology-enabled quantum logic and information science: how to establish topological control principles driven by quantum coherence and understand the time dependence of such periodic driving. Here we demonstrate a few-cycle THz-pulse-induced phase transition in a Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 that is periodically driven by vibrational coherence due to excitation of the lowest Raman active mode. Above a critical THz-pump field threshold, there emerges a long-lived metastable phase, approximately 100 ps, with unique Raman phonon-assisted topological switching dynamics absent for optical pumping. The switching also manifests itself by distinct features: nonthermal spectral shape, relaxation slowing near the Lifshitz transition where the critical Dirac point occurs, and diminishing signals at the same temperature that the Berry-curvature-induced anomalous Hall effect \u2026",
                "We discover hidden Rashba fine structure in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and demonstrate its quantum control by vibrational coherence through symmetry-selective vibronic (electron-phonon) coupling. Above a critical threshold of a single-cycle terahertz pump field, a Raman phonon mode distinctly modulates the middle excitonic states with persistent coherence for more than ten times longer than the ones on two sides that predominately couple to infrared phonons. These vibronic quantum beats, together with first-principles modeling of phonon periodically modulated Rashba parameters, identify a threefold excitonic fine structure splitting, ie, optically forbidden, degenerate dark states in between two bright ones with a narrow,\u223c 3 nm splitting. Harnessing of vibronic quantum coherence and symmetry inspires light-perovskite quantum control and sub-THz-cycle \u201cRashba engineering\u201d of spin-split bands for ultimate \u2026",
                "We report the discovery of helicity-dependent ultrafast photocurrent generation in organic-inorganic perovskite by measuring terahertz (THz) electric field emissions in the time-domain. We find signatures of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) where right circularly polarized light and left circularly polarized light lead to different photocurrent generation. The direction of photocurrent is also resolved by measuring the polarization of the emitted THz pulses. Furthermore, we observe distinct wavelength-dependent, coherent phonon dynamics using THz pump-induced differential reflectivity, indicative of multiple exciton resonances. Both the CPGE and exciton fine structure, together with theoretical simulations, provide compelling and complementary evidence for the existence of Rashba-type bands in perovskite."
