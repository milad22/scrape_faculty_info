                "Diluted magnetic semiconductors have received much attention due to their potential applications for spintronics devices. A prototypical system (Ga, Mn) As has been widely studied since the 1990s. The simultaneous spin and charge doping via hetero-valent (Ga 3+, Mn 2+) substitution, however, resulted in severely limited solubility without availability of bulk specimens. Here we report the synthesis of a new diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ba 1\u2212 x K x)(Zn 1\u2212 y Mn y) 2 As 2, which is isostructural to the 122 iron-based superconductors with the tetragonal ThCr 2 Si 2 (122) structure. Holes are doped via (Ba 2+, K 1+) replacements, while spins via isovalent (Zn 2+, Mn 2+) substitutions. Bulk samples with x= 0.1\u2212 0.3 and y= 0.05\u2212 0.15 exhibit ferromagnetic order with T C up to 180 K, which is comparable to the highest T C for (Ga, Mn) As and significantly enhanced from T C up to 50 K of the \u2018111\u2019-based Li (Zn, Mn) As \u2026",
                "We report the discovery of a diluted magnetic semiconductor, Li (Zn, Mn) P, in which charge and spin are introduced independently via lithium off-stoichiometry and the isovalent substitution of Mn 2+ for Zn 2+, respectively. Isostructural to (Ga, Mn) As, Li (Zn, Mn) P was found to be a p-type ferromagnetic semiconductor with excess lithium providing charge doping. First-principles calculations indicate that excess Li is favored to partially occupy the Zn site, leading to hole doping. Ferromagnetism with Curie temperature up to 34 K is achieved while the system still shows semiconducting transport behavior.",
                "We report the synthesis and characterization of a bulk diluted magnetic semiconductor (La 1\u2212 x Ba x)(Zn 1\u2212 x Mn x) AsO (0\u2a7d x\u2a7d 0.2) with a layered crystal structure identical to that of the 1111-type FeAs superconductors. No ferromagnetic order occurs with (Zn, Mn) substitution in the parent compound LaZnAsO without charge doping. Together with carrier doping via (La, Ba) substitution, a small amount of Mn substituting for Zn results in ferromagnetic order with T C up to\u223c 40 K, although the system remains semiconducting. Muon spin relaxation measurements confirm the development of ferromagnetic order in the entire volume, with the relationship between the internal field and T C consistent with the trend found in (Ga, Mn) As and the 111-type Li (Zn, Mn) As and the 122-type (Ba, K)(Zn, Mn) 2 As 2 systems.",
                "In its orthorhombic T d polymorph, MoTe 2 is a type-II Weyl semimetal, where the Weyl fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and hole pockets. Non-saturating magnetoresistance and superconductivity were also observed in T d-MoTe 2. Understanding the superconductivity in T d-MoTe 2, which was proposed to be topologically non-trivial, is of eminent interest. Here, we report high-pressure muon-spin rotation experiments probing the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth in T d-MoTe 2. A substantial increase of the superfluid density and a linear scaling with the superconducting critical temperature T c is observed under pressure. Moreover, the superconducting order parameter in T d-MoTe 2 is determined to have 2-gap s-wave symmetry. We also exclude time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state with zero-field \u03bcSR experiments. Considering the strong suppression \u2026"
