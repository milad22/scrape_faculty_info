                "X-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray Raman scattering were used to probe the molecular arrangement in the first coordination shell of liquid water. The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen\u2013bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen\u2013bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C, 5 to 10% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen\u2013bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water. Serious discrepancies with structures based on current molecular dynamics simulations are observed.",
                "The creation of a 1s core hole in a 3d transition metal ion gives rise to an emission spectrum that can be recorded using a crystal analyzer. K shell X-ray spectroscopy using an analyser energy bandwidth of \u223c1 eV is sensitive to electron\u2013electron interactions and orbital splittings and preserves the advantages of the hard X-ray probe. We review recent developments in K\u03b1 and K\u03b2 spectroscopy and show how the chemical sensitivity of the fluorescence lines can be exploited for selective X-ray absorption studies. When the photo excitation energy is tuned close to the K edge threshold, the phenomenon known as X-ray resonant Raman or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) occurs. RIXS spectroscopy on 3d transition metals at the 1s resonances with lowest incident energies (K pre-edge) is a very recent technique. We discuss basic aspects and demonstrate with several examples its potential as a future routine \u2026",
                "Nitrogenase is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia. Despite insight from structural and biochemical studies, its structure and mechanism await full characterization. An iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is thought to be the site of dinitrogen reduction, but the identity of a central atom in this cofactor remains unknown. Fe K\u03b2 x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of intact nitrogenase MoFe protein, isolated FeMoco, and the FeMoco-deficient \u2206nifB protein indicates that among the candidate atoms oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, it is carbon that best fits the XES data. The experimental XES is supported by computational efforts, which show that oxidation and spin states do not affect the assignment of the central atom to C4\u2013. Identification of the central atom will drive further studies on its role in catalysis.",
                "X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to measure the damage caused by exposure to x-rays to the Mn4Ca active site in single crystals of photosystem II as a function of dose and energy of x-rays, temperature, and time. These studies reveal that the conditions used for structure determination by x-ray crystallography cause serious damage specifically to the metal-site structure. The x-ray absorption spectra show that the structure changes from one that is characteristic of a high-valent Mn4(III2,IV2) oxo-bridged Mn4Ca cluster to that of Mn(II) in aqueous solution. This damage to the metal site occurs at a dose that is more than one order of magnitude lower than the dose that results in loss of diffractivity and is commonly considered safe for protein crystallography. These results establish quantitative x-ray dose parameters that are applicable to redox-active metalloproteins. This case study shows that a careful \u2026",
                "Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is used to demonstrate the presence of density fluctuations in ambient water on a physical length-scale of \u22481 nm; this is retained with decreasing temperature while the magnitude is enhanced. In contrast, the magnitude of fluctuations in a normal liquid, such as CCl4, exhibits no enhancement with decreasing temperature, as is also the case for water from molecular dynamics simulations under ambient conditions. Based on X-ray emission spectroscopy and X-ray Raman scattering data we propose that the density difference contrast in SAXS is due to fluctuations between tetrahedral-like and hydrogen-bond distorted structures related to, respectively, low and high density water. We combine our experimental observations to propose a model of water as a temperature-dependent, fluctuating equilibrium between the two types of local structures driven by incommensurate \u2026",
                "Intense femtosecond x-ray pulses produced at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) were used for simultaneous x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of microcrystals of photosystem II (PS II) at room temperature. This method probes the overall protein structure and the electronic structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of PS II. XRD data are presented from both the dark state (S1) and the first illuminated state (S2) of PS II. Our simultaneous XRD-XES study shows that the PS II crystals are intact during our measurements at the LCLS, not only with respect to the structure of PS II, but also with regard to the electronic structure of the highly radiation-sensitive Mn4CaO5 cluster, opening new directions for future dynamics studies.",
                "Crucial to many light-driven processes in transition metal complexes is the absorption and dissipation of energy by 3d electrons 1, 2, 3, 4. But a detailed understanding of such non-equilibrium excited-state dynamics and their interplay with structural changes is challenging: a multitude of excited states and possible transitions result in phenomena too complex to unravel when faced with the indirect sensitivity of optical spectroscopy to spin dynamics 5 and the flux limitations of ultrafast X-ray sources 6, 7. Such a situation exists for archetypal polypyridyl iron complexes, such as [Fe (2, 2\u2032-bipyridine) 3] 2+, where the excited-state charge and spin dynamics involved in the transition from a low-to a high-spin state (spin crossover) have long been a source of interest and controversy 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Here we demonstrate that femtosecond resolution X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, with its sensitivity to \u2026",
                "A key question for the understanding of photosynthetic water oxidation is whether the four oxidizing equivalents necessary to oxidize water to dioxygen are accumulated on the four Mn ions of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), or whether some ligand-centered oxidations take place before the formation and release of dioxygen during the S3 \u2192 [S4] \u2192 S0 transition. Progress in instrumentation and flash sample preparation allowed us to apply Mn K\u03b2 X-ray emission spectroscopy (K\u03b2 XES) to this problem for the first time. The K\u03b2 XES results, in combination with Mn X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data obtained from the same set of samples, show that the S2 \u2192 S3 transition, in contrast to the S0 \u2192 S1 and S1 \u2192 S2 transitions, does not involve a Mn-centered oxidation. On the basis of new structural data from the S3-state, manganese \u03bc-oxo bridge radical \u2026",
                "Delayed coherent nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron radiation by polycrystalline Fe foils (both isotopically enriched and naturally abundant) has been measured. Quantum beats wre observed in the time spectra. With the chosen experimental conditions these can only arise from coherent scattering. The 5-meV bandwidth provided by a special silicon crystal monochromator obviates the need for a nuclear resonant filter. This direct approach offers the possibility of performing a wide range of M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy experiments using synchrotron radiation.",
                "A propagating excitation with a velocity of sound of 3200\u00b1100 m\/s is measured in H 2 O at 294 K between 4 and 14 nm\u2212 1, using inelastic x-ray scattering with 5 meV energy resolution. The existence of fast sound is therefore demonstrated in an energy-momentum region much wider than that of previous neutron measurements on D 2 O. The equivalence of the fast sound velocity in H 2 O and in D 2 O rules out models where this mode propagates only on the hydrogen network. These results show the ability of inelastic x-ray scattering to study the collective dynamics of liquids."
