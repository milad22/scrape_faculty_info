                "We describe a high-resolution, high-bandwidth technique for determining the local viscoelasticity of soft materials such as polymer gels. Loss and storage shear moduli are determined from the power spectra of thermal fluctuations of embedded micron-sized probe particles, observed with an interferometric microscope. This provides a passive, small-amplitude measurement of rheological properties over a much broader frequency range than previously accessible to microrheology. We study both F-actin biopolymer solutions and polyacrylamide (PAAm) gels, as model semiflexible and flexible systems, respectively. We observe high-frequency \u03c9 3\/4 scaling of the shear modulus in F-actin solutions, in contrast to \u03c9 1\/2 scaling for PAAm.",
                "Recent experiments in some polymer melts quenched below the melting temperature have reported spinodal kinetics in small-angle x-ray scattering before the emergence of a crystalline structure. To explain these observations we propose that the coupling between density and chain conformation induces a liquid-liquid binodal within the equilibrium liquid-crystalline solid coexistence region. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to illustrate this idea, and several experimentally testable consequences are discussed. Shear is shown to enhance the kinetic role of the hidden binodal.",
                "In this review, I present an idiosyncratic view of the current state of shear banding in complex fluids. Particular attention is paid to some of the outstanding issues and questions facing the field, including the applicability of models that have \u201ctraditionally\u201d been used to model experiments; future directions and challenges for experimentalists; and some of the issues surrounding vorticity banding, which has been discussed theoretically and whose experiments are fewer in number yet, in many ways, more varied in character.",
                "Proteins show diverse responses when placed under mechanical stress. The molecular origins of their differing mechanical resistance are still unclear, although the orientation of secondary structural elements relative to the applied force vector is thought to have an important function. Here, by using a method of protein immobilization that allows force to be applied to the same all-\u03b2 protein, E2lip3, in two different directions, we show that the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding is markedly anisotropic. These results, in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reveal that the unfolding pathway depends on the pulling geometry and is associated with unfolding forces that differ by an order of magnitude. Thus, the mechanical resistance of a protein is not dictated solely by amino acid sequence, topology or unfolding rate constant, but depends critically on the direction of the applied extension.",
                "We analyze the steady planar shear flow of the modified Johnson-Segalman model, which has an added nonlocal term. We find that the new term allows for unambiguous selection of the stress at which two \u201cphases\u201d coexist, in contrast to the original model. For general differential constitutive models we show the singular nature of stress selection in terms of a saddle connection between fixed points in the equivalent dynamical system. The result means that stress selection is unique under most conditions for space nonlocal models. Finally, illustrated by simple models, we show that stress selection generally depends on the form of the nonlocal terms (weak universality).",
                "We study the Johnson\u2013Segalman (JS) model as a paradigm for some complex fluids which are observed to phase separate, or \u201cshear band\u201d in flow. We analyze the behavior of this model in cylindrical Couette flow and demonstrate the history dependence inherent in the local JS model. We add a simple gradient term to the stress dynamics and demonstrate how this term breaks the degeneracy of the local model and prescribes a much smaller (discrete, rather than continuous) set of banded steady state solutions. We investigate some of the effects of the curvature of Couette flow on the observable steady state behavior and kinetics, and discuss some of the implication for metastability.",
                "Macroscopic fluid motion can have dramatic consequences near the isotropic-nematic transition in fluids of nematogens. We explore some of these consequences using both deterministic and stochastic descriptions involving coupled hydrodynamic equations of motion for the nematic order parameter and fluid velocity fields. By analyzing the deterministic equations of motion we identify the locally stable states of homogeneous nematic order and strain rate, thus determining the homogeneous nonequilibrium steady states which the fluid may adopt. By examining inhomogeneous steady states we construct the analog of a first-order phase boundary, ie, a line in the nonequilibrium phase diagram spanned by temperature and applied stress, at which nonequilibrium states may coexist, and which terminates in a nonequilibrium analog of a critical point. From an analysis of the nematic order-parameter discontinuity \u2026",
                "We consider the impact of shear flow on the isotropic-nematic transition in crystalline liquids by generalizing Leslie-Ericksen dynamics of nematic systems to include amplitude and biaxial degrees of freedom. Neglecting fluctuations, we find steady-state solutions to the equations of motion for the nematic order parameter and fluid velocity and interpret them in terms of nonequilibrium steady states. We predict a transition temperature increasing with shear rate up to a nonequilibrium critical point, and discuss the singular behavior of the order parameter and external stress near this point.",
                "\u03b2-sheet proteins are generally more able to resist mechanical deformation than \u03b1-helical proteins. Experiments measuring the mechanical resistance of \u03b2-sheet proteins extended by their termini led to the hypothesis that parallel, directly hydrogen-bonded terminal \u03b2-strands provide the greatest mechanical strength. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the mechanical properties of protein L, a domain with a topology predicted to be mechanically strong, but with no known mechanical function. A pentamer of this small, topologically simple protein is resistant to mechanical deformation over a wide range of extension rates. Molecular dynamics simulations show the energy landscape for protein L is highly restricted for mechanical unfolding and that this protein unfolds by the shearing apart of two structural units in a mechanism similar to that proposed for ubiquitin, which belongs to the same structural class as \u2026",
                "Polyolefins comprise the most widely used class of synthetic polymers, and their conversion into products generally involves shaping a liquid (using a die or a mold) and then stabilizing that shape by crystallization. In the semicrystalline solid state the degree of crystallinity and crystal orientation determines the physical properties and is strongly dependent on processing conditions. 1 The morphology spans a structural hierarchy from molecular (< nm) to just visible (< mm) length scales that is technologically very important and scientifically rather challenging. Flow introduces a profound change from isotropic spherulites to highly oriented \u201cshish kebabs\u201d with a corresponding large increase in stiffness and strength. 2 All industrial polymers have a distribution of molecular species, in terms of both their total length and degree of branching, and the flowinduced morphological transition is particularly sensitive to those \u2026"

Following\u00a0post-docs at Exxon, Cambridge, and the University of Michigan, where he\u00a0worked on a variety of soft matter physics topics (membrane, polymers,\u00a0biophysics, liquid crystals and liquid crystalline elastomers), he moved to Leeds in 1996 for a University\u00a0Research Fellowship. He became Professor in 2005, and led the Soft\u00a0Matter Physics group in Leeds from 2008-2013. In 2014 he moved to Georgetown University in Washington DC, as Joseph Semmes Ives Chair in Physics, where he joined the new Institute for Soft Matter Synthesis and Metrology (ISM2). He is currently the Director of the Institute. Olmsted is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (UK), and a Fellow of the American Physical Society (Division of Polymer Physics), and he was awarded the British Society of Rheology Annual Award in 2008. His research achievements include models for polymer crystallization at rest and under flow, explanations for shear banding in complex fluids such as polymer and surfactants, and an experimental-computational collaboration\u00a0that revealed how mechanical force unfolds proteins. While in the UK he was in several European Union networks on Soft Matter, and led the EU Integrated Training Network DYNACOP (Dynamics of Architecturally Complex Fluids) from 2008-2012. \u00a0He was\u00a0the Secretary\/Treasurer of the APS Topical Group on Soft Matter (GSOFT) from 2014-2018. Olmsted\u2019s current research is mainly theory and\u00a0computer simulation, and includes rheology, dynamics and instabilities in soft matter, polymers, lipid membranes, and proteins. Common threads in his work are phase transitions, non-equilibrium phenomena, and fluctuations. He works\u00a0closely with experimentalists, and often on industrially-motivated problems.
