                "The successive discoveries of fullerenes1 and carbon nanotubes2 (CNTs) around 1990 triggered a hot wave of scientific research to explore the properties and applications of these new forms of carbonous materials over the past two decades. Figure 1 shows schematically the research area centered at fullerene C60. Differing from the two long-known allotropes of carbon, ie, diamond and graphite, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes have displayed brand-new, unique, and fascinating structural, electronic, electric, mechanic, and optical properties and should find their power in a wide variety of applications. 3, 4 Some of their unique properties can be related to the curved \u03c0-conjugation within their curved hexagonal (for CNTs) or hybrid hexagon-pentagon (for fullerenes) carbon-carbon networks. The curved \u03c0-conjugation and aromaticity, as well as the related chemistry, of fullerene [60] and its larger homologues \u2026",
                "All carbon cages (fullerenes) synthesized so far, such as C60 and its larger homologs, faithfully satisfy the isolated pentagon rale (1PR)(\/). which governs the stability of fullerenes comprising hexagons and exactly 12 pentagons. The smaller non-IPR fullerenes (2-\u042f), which are predicted to have unusual properties because of their adjacent pentagons and high curvature (2 8), are so labile that their properties and reactivity have only been studied in the gas phase (1-3). Experimental efforts directed at their bulk synthesis have produced some results (4-6), but complete structural characterization is still under way (7). Here we report the synthesis in milligram quantity of a small non-IPR fullercnc C50, a long-sought little sister of CM (\/, 3, 8, 9), through the introduction of chlorine in the form of carbon tetrachloride (CCI4) during synthesis from graphite. C4)-containing soot (~ 90 g) was synthesized in a modified graphite arc \u2026",
                "The ongoing rapid expansion of the Word Wide Web (WWW) greatly increases the information of effective transmission from heterogeneous individuals to various systems. Extensive research for information diffusion is introduced by a broad range of communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and empirical studies, unification and comparison of different theories and approaches are lacking, which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments in information diffusion and discuss the major challenges. We compare and evaluate available models and algorithms to respectively investigate their physical roles and optimization designs. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed. We emphasize that information diffusion has great scientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it \u2026",
                "To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV).Based on the susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infected\u2010removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019\u2010nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real\u2010time reports on the number of 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases \u2026",
                "The generation of \u03b1-imino gold carbenes via gold-catalyzed intermolecular reaction of azides and ynamides is disclosed. This new methodology allows for highly regioselective access to valuable 2-aminoindoles and 3-amino-\u03b2-carbolines in generally good to excellent yields. A mechanistic rationale for this tandem reaction, especially for the observed high regioselectivity, is supported by DFT calculations.",
                "The generation of gold carbenes via the gold-catalyzed intermolecular reaction of nucleophiles containing relatively labile N\u2013O or N\u2013N bonds with alkynes has received considerable attention during recent years. However, this protocol is not atom-economic as the reaction produces a stoichiometric amount of pyridine or quinoline waste, the cleaved part of the N\u2013O or N\u2013N bonds. In this article, we disclose an unprecedented gold-catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition between ynamides and isoxazoles, allowing rapid and practical access to a wide range of synthetically-useful 2-aminopyrroles. Most importantly, mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that this reaction presumably proceeds via an \u03b1-imino gold carbene pathway, thus providing a strategically novel, atom-economic route to the generation of gold carbenes. Other significant features of this approach include the use of readily-available \u2026",
                "Breaking the rule: The metal\u2010carbide endofullerene Sc 2 C 2@ C 68 was isolated and characterized (see picture). It has a valence state (Sc 3+) 2 (C 2) 2\u2212@ C 68 4\u2212, and its carbon cage does not comply with the isolated\u2010pentagon rule (IPR). This result, in combination with previous work on Sc 3 N@ C 68, shows that different non\u2010IPR C 68 cages can be synthesized by using different endohedral clusters as templates.",
                "Sudden, large-scale and diffuse human migration can amplify localized outbreaks of disease into widespread epidemics 1, 2, 3, 4. Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative. Here we use 11,478,484 counts of mobile phone data from individuals leaving or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout mainland China. First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across mainland China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal \u2018risk source\u2019model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize \u2026",
                "Effective response to infectious disease epidemics requires focused control measures in areas predicted to be at high risk of new outbreaks. We aimed to test whether mobile operator data could predict the early spatial evolution of the 2010 Haiti cholera epidemic. Daily case data were analysed for 78 study areas from October 16 to December 16, 2010. Movements of 2.9 million anonymous mobile phone SIM cards were used to create a national mobility network. Two gravity models of population mobility were implemented for comparison. Both were optimized based on the complete retrospective epidemic data, available only after the end of the epidemic spread. Risk of an area experiencing an outbreak within seven days showed strong dose-response relationship with the mobile phone-based infectious pressure estimates. The mobile phone-based model performed better (AUC 0.79) than the retrospectively \u2026",
                "Anti-aromatic compounds, as well as small cyclic alkynes or carbynes, are particularly challenging synthetic goals. The combination of their destabilizing features hinders attempts to prepare molecules such as pentalyne, an 8\u03c0-electron anti-aromatic bicycle with extremely high ring strain. Here we describe the facile synthesis of osmapentalyne derivatives that are thermally viable, despite containing the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne carbon. The compounds are characterized using X-ray crystallography, and their computed energies and magnetic properties reveal aromatic character. Hence, the incorporation of the osmium centre not only reduces the ring strain of the parent pentalyne, but also converts its H\u00fcckel anti-aromaticity into Craig-type M\u00f6bius aromaticity in the metallapentalynes. The concept of aromaticity is thus extended to five-membered rings containing a metal\u2013carbon triple bond \u2026"
