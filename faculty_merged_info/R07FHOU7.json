                "This reprinted article originally appeared in Developmental Psychology, 2004, Vol 40 [5], 703-713.(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2006-20488-023.) Although existing literature demonstrates that developmental benefits are associated with religion for adolescents, little is understood about the dynamics of this relationship. Drawing on social capital theory, this study tested a conceptual model exploring socially embedded religious influences on moral outcomes. A three-dimensional model of social capital demonstrated how social interaction, trust, and shared vision enable social ties associated with religiousness to influence moral behavior. Structural equation modeling was used with data gathered from 735 urban youths to test a proposed model of the effects of religiousness on moral outcomes. Results suggested that religiously active youths report higher levels of social capital \u2026",
                "The role of religious identity in positive youth development was examined in this study of personal meaning and prosocial concerns in adolescence. A structural equation model was tested on a sample of 801 urban public high school students. Participants responded to questionnaires assessing religious identity, personal meaning, and prosocial personality. Prototypical descriptors derived from Walker and Pitts's (1998) highly religious person concept were examined as a measure of religious identity. Findings demonstrate a positive relationship between religious self-understanding, personal meaning, and prosocial personality. Differences were noted in the relationship of personal meaning to prosocial personality across age and gender cohorts. The findings provide further support for considering religion as a developmental resource associated with personal meaning and a concern for others among youth.",

                "In this article we preset the results of a discovery\u2010oriented task analysis research study identifying specific therapist behaviors that facilitate softening events in emotionally focused therapy (EFT) for couples. Therapy sessions conducted by an expert EFT therapist were examined. Six therapist content theme shifts were identified and specific interventions were delineated within each using an EFT coding scheme (EFT\u2010CS) created for this study. This study extends the theoretical understanding of the softening process\u2010a key change event in an empirically validated couples therapy approach\u2010and provides a detailed clinical map for the training of therapists.",
                "Religious involvement is associated with a variety of positive developmental outcomes including restraint from risk, increased coping, and prosocial values and behavior. This study examines a model that explains religious influence on these positive outcomes through the mediating effects of developmental resources important in adolescence. Tests of the model on questionnaire responses derived from a sample of 20,020 youth in grades 6-12 suggest that religious factors are associated with increased developmental assets that in turn predict positive behaviors and values among youth. Findings support the hypothesis that religious influences upon positive outcomes are mediated primarily through their effect on developmental assets. While differences in outcomes were noted across gender and grade cohorts, little variation in the proposed model was noted in cohort comparisons. Results of the study question the \u2026"
