                "We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) using 278.8 days of data collected with the XENON1T experiment at LNGS. XENON1T utilizes a liquid xenon time projection chamber with a fiducial mass of (1.30\u00b10.01) t o n, resulting in a 1.0 ton yr exposure. The energy region of interest,[1.4, 10.6] keV ee ([4.9, 40.9] keV nr), exhibits an ultralow electron recoil background rate of [82\u2212 3+ 5 (syst)\u00b13 (stat)] events\/(t o n yr keV ee). No significant excess over background is found, and a profile likelihood analysis parametrized in spatial and energy dimensions excludes new parameter space for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic scatter cross section for WIMP masses above 6 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 4.1\u00d7 10\u2212 47 cm 2 at 30 GeV\/c 2 and a 90% confidence level.",
                "We report the first dark matter search results from XENON1T, a\u223c 2000\u2212 kg-target-mass dual-phase (liquid-gas) xenon time projection chamber in operation at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy and the first ton-scale detector of this kind. The blinded search used 34.2 live days of data acquired between November 2016 and January 2017. Inside the (1042\u00b112)\u2212 kg fiducial mass and in the [5, 40] keV nr energy range of interest for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter searches, the electronic recoil background was (1.93\u00b10.25)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 events\/(kg\u00d7 day\u00d7 keV ee), the lowest ever achieved in such a dark matter detector. A profile likelihood analysis shows that the data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. We derive the most stringent exclusion limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section for WIMP masses above 10 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 7.7\u00d7 \u2026",
                "The XENON1T experiment is currently in the commissioning phase at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. In this article we study the experiment's expected sensitivity to the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section, based on Monte Carlo predictions of the electronic and nuclear recoil backgrounds.",
                "We report on WIMP search results of the XENON100 experiment, combining three runs summing up to 477 live days from January 2010 to January 2014. Data from the first two runs were already published. A blind analysis was applied to the last run recorded between April 2013 and January 2014 prior to combining the results. The ultralow electromagnetic background of the experiment,\u223c 5\u00d7 10\u2212 3 events\/(keV ee\u00d7 kg\u00d7 day)) before electronic recoil rejection, together with the increased exposure of 48 kg\u00d7 yr, improves the sensitivity. A profile likelihood analysis using an energy range of (6.6\u201343.3) keV nr sets a limit on the elastic, spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section for WIMP masses above 8 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 1.1\u00d7 10\u2212 45 cm 2 at 50 GeV\/c 2 and 90% confidence level. We also report updated constraints on the elastic, spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections obtained with the \u2026",
                "The XENON1T experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is the first WIMP dark matter detector operating with a liquid xenon target mass above the ton-scale. Out of its 3.2 t liquid xenon inventory, 2.0 t constitute the active target of the dual-phase time projection chamber. The scintillation and ionization signals from particle interactions are detected with low-background photomultipliers. This article describes the XENON1T instrument and its subsystems as well as strategies to achieve an unprecedented low background level. First results on the detector response and the performance of the subsystems are also presented.",
                "We present the first results of searches for axions and axionlike particles with the XENON100 experiment. The axion-electron coupling constant, g Ae, has been probed by exploiting the axioelectric effect in liquid xenon. A profile likelihood analysis of 224.6 live days\u00d7 34-kg exposure has shown no evidence for a signal. By rejecting g Ae larger than 7.7\u00d7 10\u2212 12 (90% CL) in the solar axion search, we set the best limit to date on this coupling. In the frame of the DFSZ and KSVZ models, we exclude QCD axions heavier than 0.3 and 80 eV\/c 2, respectively. For axionlike particles, under the assumption that they constitute the whole abundance of dark matter in our galaxy, we constrain g Ae to be lower than 1\u00d7 10\u2212 12 (90% CL) for masses between 5 and 10 keV\/c 2.",
                "We report constraints on light dark matter (DM) models using ionization signals in the XENON1T experiment. We mitigate backgrounds with strong event selections, rather than requiring a scintillation signal, leaving an effective exposure of (22\u00b13) tonne day. Above\u223c 0.4 keV e e, we observe< 1 event\/(tonne day keV e e), which is more than 1000 times lower than in similar searches with other detectors. Despite observing a higher rate at lower energies, no DM or CEvNS detection may be claimed because we cannot model all of our backgrounds. We thus exclude new regions in the parameter spaces for DM-nucleus scattering for DM masses m \u03c7 within 3\u20136 GeV\/c 2, DM-electron scattering for m \u03c7> 30 MeV\/c 2, and absorption of dark photons and axionlike particles for m \u03c7 within 0.186\u20131 keV\/c 2.",
                "We report the first experimental results on spin-dependent elastic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) nucleon scattering from the XENON1T dark matter search experiment. The analysis uses the full ton year exposure of XENON1T to constrain the spin-dependent proton-only and neutron-only cases. No significant signal excess is observed, and a profile likelihood ratio analysis is used to set exclusion limits on the WIMP-nucleon interactions. This includes the most stringent constraint to date on the WIMP-neutron cross section, with a minimum of 6.3\u00d7 10\u2212 42 cm 2 at 30 GeV\/c 2 and 90% confidence level. The results are compared with those from collider searches and used to exclude new parameter space in an isoscalar theory with an axial-vector mediator.",
                "We perform a low-mass dark matter search using an exposure of 30 kg\u00d7 yr with the XENON100 detector. By dropping the requirement of a scintillation signal and using only the ionization signal to determine the interaction energy, we lowered the energy threshold for detection to 0.7 keV for nuclear recoils. No dark matter detection can be claimed because a complete background model cannot be constructed without a primary scintillation signal. Instead, we compute an upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section under the assumption that every event passing our selection criteria could be a signal event. Using an energy interval from 0.7 keV to 9.1 keV, we derive a limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section that excludes WIMPs with a mass of 6 GeV\/c 2 above 1.4\u00d7 10\u2212 41 cm 2 at 90% confidence level.",
                "The XENON100 dark matter experiment uses liquid xenon in a time projection chamber (TPC) to measure xenon nuclear recoils resulting from the scattering of dark matter weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). In this paper, we report the observation of single-electron charge signals which are not related to WIMP interactions. These signals, which show the excellent sensitivity of the detector to small charge signals, are explained as being due to the photoionization of impurities in the liquid xenon and of the metal components inside the TPC. They are used as a unique calibration source to characterize the detector. We explain how we can infer crucial parameters for the XENON100 experiment: the secondary-scintillation gain, the extraction yield from the liquid to the gas phase and the electron drift velocity."
