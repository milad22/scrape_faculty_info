                "We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus\u2013nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au\u2009+\u2009Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet \u2026",
                "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",
                "Angular correlations between charged trigger and associated particles are measured by the ALICE detector in p\u2013Pb collisions at a nucleon\u2013nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV for transverse momentum ranges within 0.5< p T, assoc< p T, trig< 4 GeV\/c. The correlations are measured over two units of pseudorapidity and full azimuthal angle in different intervals of event multiplicity, and expressed as associated yield per trigger particle. Two long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near side and one on the away side, are observed when the per-trigger yield obtained in low-multiplicity events is subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity events. The excess on the near-side is qualitatively similar to that recently reported by the CMS Collaboration, while the excess on the away-side is reported for the first time. The two-ridge structure projected onto azimuthal angle is quantified with the second and third Fourier \u2026",
                "We report measurements of single-particle inclusive spectra and two-particle azimuthal distributions of charged hadrons at high transverse momentum (high p T) in minimum bias and central d+ A u collisions at s N N= 200 G e V. The inclusive yield is enhanced in d+ A u collisions relative to binary-scaled p+ p collisions, while the two-particle azimuthal distributions are very similar to those observed in p+ p collisions. These results demonstrate that the strong suppression of the inclusive yield and back-to-back correlations at high p T previously observed in central A u+ A u collisions are due to final-state interactions with the dense medium generated in such collisions.",
                "Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral collisions, corresponding to 0\u20135% and 70\u201380% of the hadronic Pb\u2013Pb cross section. The measured charged particle spectra in| \u03b7|< 0.8 and 0.3< p T< 20 GeV\/c are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same s NN, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon\u2013nucleon collisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor R AA. The result indicates only weak medium effects (R AA\u2248 0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, R AA reaches a minimum of about 0.14 at p T= 6\u20137 GeV\/c and increases significantly at larger p T. The measured suppression of high-p T particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies, indicating that a very \u2026",
                "The centrality dependence of the charged-particle multiplicity density at midrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV is presented. The charged-particle density normalized per participating nucleon pair increases by about a factor of 2 from peripheral (70%\u201380%) to central (0%\u20135%) collisions. The centrality dependence is found to be similar to that observed at lower collision energies. The data are compared with models based on different mechanisms for particle production in nuclear collisions.",
                "We report the first measurement of charged particle elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at s N N= 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region (| \u03b7|< 0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2< p t< 5.0 GeV\/c. The elliptic flow signal v 2, measured using the 4-particle correlation method, averaged over transverse momentum and pseudorapidity is 0.087\u00b10.002 (stat)\u00b10.003 (syst) in the 40%\u201350% centrality class. The differential elliptic flow v 2 (p t) reaches a maximum of 0.2 near p t= 3 GeV\/c. Compared to RHIC Au-Au collisions at s N N= 200 GeV, the elliptic flow increases by about 30%. Some hydrodynamic model predictions which include viscous corrections are in agreement with the observed increase.",
                "In this paper measurements are presented of \u03c0\u00b1, K\u00b1, p, and p production at midrapidity (| y|< 0.5), in Pb-Pb collisions at s N N= 2.76 TeV as a function of centrality. The measurement covers the transverse-momentum (p T) range from 100, 200, and 300 MeV\/c up to 3, 3, and 4.6 GeV\/c for \u03c0, K, and p, respectively. The measured p T distributions and yields are compared to expectations based on hydrodynamic, thermal and recombination models. The spectral shapes of central collisions show a stronger radial flow than measured at lower energies, which can be described in hydrodynamic models. In peripheral collisions, the p T distributions are not well reproduced by hydrodynamic models. Ratios of integrated particle yields are found to be nearly independent of centrality. The yield of protons normalized to pions is a factor\u223c 1.5 lower than the expectation from thermal models.",
                "Azimuthal correlations for large transverse momentum charged hadrons have been measured over a wide pseudorapidity range and full azimuth in A u+ A u and p+ p collisions at s N N= 200 G e V. The small-angle correlations observed in p+ p collisions and at all centralities of A u+ A u collisions are characteristic of hard-scattering processes previously observed in high-energy collisions. A strong back-to-back correlation exists for p+ p and peripheral A u+ A u. In contrast, the back-to-back correlations are reduced considerably in the most central A u+ A u collisions, indicating substantial interaction as the hard-scattered partons or their fragmentation products traverse the medium.",

Allan Bromley Professor Emeritus WL-W 311 203-432-6106 john.harris@yale.edu Experimental Nuclear Physics The research interests of Professor John Harris are focused on understanding high energy density Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) created in relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei. QCD calculations on a lattice predict that a transition from normal nuclear or hadronic matter to a deconfined phase of matter consisting of strongly interacting quarks and gluons, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), will occur at extremely high energy densities above approximately 2 GeV\/fm 3 . This corresponds to a temperature of 2 x 10 12 Kelvin. Such energy densities are predicted to have existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang, are created in collisions of heavy nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies and may exist in the cores of neutron stars. Formation and discovery of the QGP is the primary purpose of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in New York and at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.\nJohn Harris was involved in the original proposal to initiate a nucleus-nucleus experimental program at CERN to search for a possible QGP phase transition, and has been an active member in the planning, conceptual design, construction, data acquisition and physics of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus experiments NA35 and NA49 at CERN, and the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC) experiment at Brookhaven. He was the founding spokesperson for STAR from 1991 until 2002. He is currently involved in the ALICE experiment at the LHC at CERN and has served as the National Coordinator for the ALICE-USA Collaboration, Chair and Deputy Chair of the ALICE Collaboration Board and on other boards in ALICE (e.g. Physics Board). Research activities focus on the use of hard scattering processes to identify the properties of the QGP utilizing heavy ions and the design of a comprehensive experiment for the forthcoming Electron Ion Collider .
