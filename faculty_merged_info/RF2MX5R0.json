                "The use of octadecylamine modified montmorillonite as substitute of carbon black in natural rubber (NR) compounds is studied. Rubber with 10 parts per hundred resin (phr) of pristine (clay) and octadecylamine modified montmorillonite (organoclay) were compared with 10 and 40 phr carbon black as filler. The modified silicate is analysed by X-ray, FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis. Vulcametric curves show that the organoclay and carbon black accelerate the vulcanization reaction and, furthermore, give rise to a marked increase in the torque, indicating a higher degree of crosslinking as was also confirmed by swelling measurements and DSC. The vulcanisation rate and torque value of the organoclay compound are sensibly higher than the carbon black compound even at high contents (40 phr). Mechanical characterization shows the strong reinforcing effect of both fillers up to 350% in the strength in relation \u2026",
                "Graphene has attracted the attention of a growing number of scientists from several disciplines due to its remarkable physical properties and chemical functionalisation capabilities. This review presents an overview of graphene\/polymer nanocomposites discussing preparation, properties and potential applications. The challenges and outlook of these emerging polymer nanocomposites are also discussed.",
                "In this work well uniform dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) was achieved by shear mixing. The results obtained from the differential scanning calorimetry curves indicate that the addition of low SWNT amounts (less than 1 wt%) led to an increase in the rate of polymer crystallization with no substantial changes in the crystalline structure, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The tensile mechanical properties showed that Young\u2019s modulus and tensile strength considerably increase in the presence of nanotubes, with a maximum for 0.75 wt%. The reinforcing effect of SWNTs was also confirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis where, by adding nanotubes, a noticeable increase in the storage modulus was detected. The beneficial effects of SWNT incorporation was underlined comparing the results obtained with those of carbon black used as a filler.",
                "This review reports the promising prospects of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based nanostructured materials considering two of their main potential uses, packaging and tissue engineering. The review initially discusses the significant progresses in the development of PLA bionanocomposites for packaging applications. The review then continues with a comprehensive analysis of the recent advances in tissue engineering applications focusing in the synthesis of PLA nanoparticles, the processing of PLA based multifunctional nanocomposites and PLA surface modification techniques. In summary, the review presents the current state of nanostructured PLA materials and establishes the exciting present and future prospects of these materials at the interface of chemistry, biology and material science.",
                "In this article we report the successful manufacture of a novel functionalized graphene sheet (FGS)\/silicone porous nanocomposite. Both the cellular microstructure and the properties of the porous nanocomposite were investigated in detail. The thermal properties show great stability and heat dissipation efficiency, highlighting their potential in applications with intense thermal requirements. Additionally, compression measurements indicate that there was a favourable interaction between the graphene nanosheets and the polymer.",
                "Graphene materials containing different functional groups were prepared from a natural graphite, by means of two different oxidation methods (Hummers and Brodie). It was observed that the differences in the structure of the resultant graphite oxides (GOs) greatly affect the structure of the graphenes resulting from their thermal exfoliation\/reduction. Although the oxidation of the graphite was more effective with the modified Hummers method than with Brodie\u2019s method (C\/O of 1.8 vs 2.9, as determined by XPS), the former generated a lower residual oxygen content after thermal exfoliation\/reduction and a better reconstruction of the 2D graphene structure (with fewer defects). This is explained by the presence of conjugated epoxy and hydroxyl groups in the GO obtained by Brodie\u2019s method, which upon thermal treatment, lead to the incorporation of oxygen into the carbon lattice preventing its complete restoration \u2026",
                "The effect of the incorporation of a bentonite on the vulcanization kinetics of natural rubber was investigated by means of both cure\u2010meter testing and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under dynamic and isothermal conditions. The vulcanization curves showed that the modified clay behaved as an effective vulcanizing agent, accelerating the vulcanization reaction of the elastomer. A marked decrease in the induction time and optimum cure time of the elastomer were observed in the presence of the organoclay. Although the octadecylamine itself accelerated the vulcanization process, the octadecylamine\u2010modified clay gave rise to a further noticeable increase in the vulcanization rate, which could be attributed to a synergetic effect between the filler and the amine. Moreover, in the presence of the organoclay, a dramatic increase in the torque value was obtained because of the formation of a higher number of \u2026",
                "Polylactide, PLA, is a biodegradable thermoplastic polyester derived from biomass that has restricted packaging applications due to its high brittleness and poor crystallisation behaviour. Here, new formulations based on natural rubber\u2013PLA blends have been developed. The processing windows, temperature, time, and rotor rate, and the rubber content have been optimised in order to obtain a blend with useful properties. The rubber phase was uniformly dispersed in the continuous PLA matrix with a droplet size range from 1.1 to 2.0 \u03bcm. The ductility of PLA has been significantly improved by blending with natural rubber, NR. The elongation at break improved from 5% for neat PLA to 200% by adding 10 wt% NR. In addition, the incorporation of NR not only increased the crystallisation rate but also enhanced the crystallisation ability of PLA. These materials are, therefore, very promising for industrial applications.",
                "Electro-active polymers (EAPs) are emerging as feasible materials to mimic muscle-like actuation. Among EAPs, dielectric elastomer (DE) devices are soft or flexible capacitors, composed of a thin elastomeric membrane sandwiched between two compliant electrodes, that are able to transduce electrical to mechanical energy, actuators, and vice versa, generators. Initial studies concentrated mainly on dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) and identified the electro-mechanical principles and material requirements for an optimal performance. Those requirements include the need for polymers with high dielectric permittivity and stretchability and low dielectric loss and viscoelastic damping. Hence, attaining elastomeric materials with those features is the focus of current research developments. This review provides a systematic overview of such research, highlighting the advances, challenges and future applications of \u2026",
                "This paper compares the filler percolation network of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) grown by chemical vapor deposition and thermally reduced functionalized graphene sheets (FGSs) in an epoxy resin. The filler network was evaluated by the plate\u2013plate rheological response of un-cured dispersions and the electrical properties of cured materials. We found that FGS did not raise the viscosity of the system as much as MWCNT, maintaining the Newtonian behavior even at 1.5 wt.% FGS. MWCNT readily formed a filler network compared to FGS, evidenced by lower electrical and rheological percolation thresholds, presence of yield stress and higher storage modulus of the dispersions. On the other hand, the mechanical performance of the cured FGS nanocomposites outperformed the MWCNT, with enhancements of 50% and 15% of Young\u2019s modulus and strength, respectively. This combination of good \u2026"
