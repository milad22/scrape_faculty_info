                "Nanowire field-effect transistors (NW-FETs) are emerging as powerful sensors for detection of chemical\/biological species with various attractive features including high sensitivity and direct electrical readout. Yet to date there have been limited systematic studies addressing how the fundamental factors of devices affect their sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the sensitivity of NW-FET sensors can be exponentially enhanced in the subthreshold regime where the gating effect of molecules bound on a surface is the most effective due to the reduced screening of carriers in NWs. This principle is exemplified in both pH and protein sensing experiments where the operational mode of NW-FET biosensors was tuned by electrolyte gating. The lowest charge detectable by NW-FET sensors working under different operational modes is also estimated. Our work shows that optimization of NW-FET structure and operating \u2026",
                "We report the study of a novel linear magneto-resistance (MR) under perpendicular magnetic fields in Bi2Se3 nanoribbons. Through angular dependence magneto-transport experiments, we show that this linear MR is purely due to two-dimensional (2D) transport, in agreement with the recently discovered linear MR from 2D topological surface state in bulk Bi2Te3, and the linear MR of other gapless semiconductors and graphene. We further show that the linear MR of Bi2Se3 nanoribbons persists to room temperature, underscoring the potential of exploiting topological insulator nanomaterials for room-temperature magneto-electronic applications."

Gao Research Group Interests Our lab focuses on the understanding and exploration of how quantum nature of matter, low dimensionality, confinement, electronic structure topology, symmetry, and electron-electron correlation effects etc give rise to new electrical, thermal, magnetic and optical phenomena or properties in nanoscale\/low-dimensional solid state systems. The material systems we study span semiconductors, semimetals, oxides, and even organic compounds, often in the form of nanostructures. The techniques we use in research include but not limited to vapor deposition growth of materials, nano-device fabrication, electron transport, magneto-transport, capacitance spectroscopy, thermal transport, scanning photoconductivity microscopy characterizations, and various composition\/ structural analysis methods. We are also interested in applying our results to real life applications (e.g. electronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion\/harvesting). We are looking for talented and motivated students (both undergraduates and graduates) and postdocs to help solve important issues in condensed matter physics and nanoscience.
