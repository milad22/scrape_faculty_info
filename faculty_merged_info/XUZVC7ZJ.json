                "Quantum criticality describes the collective fluctuations of matter undergoing a second-order phase transition at zero temperature. Heavy-fermion metals have in recent years emerged as prototypical systems to study quantum critical points. There have been considerable efforts, both experimental and theoretical, that use these magnetic systems to address problems that are central to the broad understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Here, we summarize some of the basic issues, including the extent to which the quantum criticality in heavy-fermion metals goes beyond the standard theory of order-parameter fluctuations, the nature of the Kondo effect in the quantum-critical regime, the non-Fermi-liquid phenomena that accompany quantum criticality and the interplay between quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity.",
                "When a metal undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition, non-Fermi-liquid behaviour arises near the critical point. All the low-energy degrees of freedom induced by quantum criticality are usually assumed to be spatially extended, corresponding to long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. But this picture has been contradicted by the results of recent experiments on a prototype system: heavy fermion metals at a zero-temperature magnetic transition. In particular, neutron scattering from CeCu 6-x Au x has revealed anomalous dynamics at atomic length scales, leading to much debate as to the fate of the local moments in the quantum-critical regime. Here we report our theoretical finding of a locally critical quantum phase transition in a model of heavy fermions. The dynamics at the critical point are in agreement with experiment. We propose local criticality to be a phenomenon of general relevance \u2026",
                "We consider the iron pnictides in terms of a proximity to a Mott insulator. The superexchange interactions contain competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor components. In the undoped parent compound, these frustrated interactions lead to a two-sublattice collinear antiferromagnet (each sublattice forming a N\u00e9el ordering), with a reduced magnitude for the ordered moment. Electron or hole doping, together with the frustration effect, suppresses the magnetic ordering and allows a superconducting state. The exchange interactions favor a d-wave superconducting order parameter; in the notation appropriate for the Fe square lattice, its orbital symmetry is d x y. A number of existing and future experiments are discussed in light of the theoretical considerations.",
                "We discuss non-Fermi liquid and quantum critical behaviour in heavy-fermion materials, focusing on the mechanism by which the electron mass appears to diverge at the quantum critical point. We ask whether the basic mechanism for the transformation involves electron diffraction off a quantum critical spin-density wave, or whether a breakdown in the composite nature of the heavy electron takes place at the quantum critical point. We show that the Hall constant changes continuously in the first scenario, but mayjump'discontinuously at a quantum critical point where the composite character of the electron quasiparticles changes.",
                "A quantum critical point (QCP) develops in a material at absolute zero when a new form of order smoothly emerges in its ground state. QCPs are of great current interest because of their singular ability to influence the finite temperature properties of materials. Recently, heavy-fermion metals have played a key role in the study of antiferromagnetic QCPs. To accommodate the heavy electrons, the Fermi surface of the heavy-fermion paramagnet is larger than that of an antiferromagnet 1, 2, 3. An important unsolved question is whether the Fermi surface transformation at the QCP develops gradually, as expected if the magnetism is of spin-density-wave (SDW) type 4, 5, or suddenly, as expected if the heavy electrons are abruptly localized by magnetism 6, 7, 8. Here we report measurements of the low-temperature Hall coefficient (R H)\u2014a measure of the Fermi surface volume\u2014in the heavy-fermion metal YbRh 2 Si 2 \u2026",
                "Quantum phase transitions arise in many-body systems because of competing interactions that promote rivaling ground states. Recent years have seen the identification of continuous quantum phase transitions, or quantum critical points, in a host of antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compounds. Studies of the interplay between the various effects have revealed new classes of quantum critical points and are uncovering a plethora of new quantum phases. At the same time, quantum criticality has provided fresh insights into the electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties of the heavy-fermion metals. We review these developments, discuss the open issues, and outline some directions for future research.",
                "At a generic quantum critical point, the thermal expansion \u03b1 is more singular than the specific heat c p. Consequently, the \u201cGr\u00fcneisen ratio,\u201d \u0393= \u03b1\/c p, diverges. When scaling applies, \u0393\u223c T\u2212 1\/(\u03bd z) at the critical pressure p= p c, providing a means to measure the scaling dimension of the most relevant operator that pressure couples to; in the alternative limit T\u2192 0 and p\u2260 p c, \u0393\u223c 1\/(p\u2212 p c) with a prefactor that is, up to the molar volume, a simple universal combination of critical exponents. For a magnetic-field driven transition, similar relations hold for the magnetocaloric effect (1\/T)\u2202 T\/\u2202 H| S. Finally, we determine the corrections to scaling in a class of metallic quantum critical points.",
                "Superconductivity develops in metals upon the formation of a coherent macroscopic quantum state of electron pairs. Iron pnictides and chalcogenides are materials that have high superconducting transition temperatures. In this Review, we describe the advances in the field that have led to higher superconducting transition temperatures in iron-based superconductors and the wide range of materials that are used to form these superconductors. We summarize the essential aspects of the normal state and the mechanism for superconductivity. We emphasize the degree of electron\u2013electron correlations and their manifestation in properties of the normal state. We examine the nature of magnetism, analyse its role in driving the electronic nematicity and discuss quantum criticality at the border of magnetism in the phase diagram. Finally, we review the amplitude and structure of the superconducting pairing, and survey \u2026",
                "Neutron experiments have indicated that the structure factor S (q, \u03c9) for the two cuprates YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 and La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4 has a different q dependence. Commensurate peaks at (\u03c0\/a, \u03c0\/a) are observed in the former case, whereas clearly incommensurate peaks are seen in the latter, for metallic hole concentrations. We attribute this contrasting q dependence to differences in the Fermi-surface geometry, obtained in band-structure approaches, and (for the YBaCuO system) also corroborated by photoemission experiments. Using a large Coulomb-U, Fermi-liquid-based scheme, we present results for the q, \u03c9 and temperature dependence of the neutron cross section as well as for the temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation, in both cuprate families at various hole concentrations. When antiferromagnetic quasiparticle interactions of moderate strength are included, these calculations compare favorably \u2026",
                "Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) offer wonderful examples of the radical macroscopic effects inherent in quantum physics: phase changes between different forms of matter driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations, typically at very low temperatures. QPTs provide new insight into outstanding problems such as high-temperature superconductivit"
