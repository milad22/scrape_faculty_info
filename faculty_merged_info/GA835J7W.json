                "Geant4 is a software toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. It is used by a large number of experiments and projects in a variety of application domains, including high energy physics, astrophysics and space science, medical physics and radiation protection. Over the past several years, major changes have been made to the toolkit in order to accommodate the needs of these user communities, and to efficiently exploit the growth of computing power made available by advances in technology. The adaptation of Geant4 to multithreading, advances in physics, detector modeling and visualization, extensions to the toolkit, including biasing and reverse Monte Carlo, and tools for physics and release validation are discussed here.",
                "A possible way to valorize citrus peels and seeds, which are byproducts of the juice extraction industry, is to use them as natural antioxidants. The antioxidant activity of several citrus peel and seed extracts obtained either by methanol extraction (free phenolic compounds) or by alkaline hydrolysis (bound phenolic compounds) was tested in a model system based on accelerated citronellal oxidation. Generally, seeds possessed greater antioxidant activity than peels. The composition of all tested samples was studied by HPLC:\u2009 methanol extracts are rich in flavones and glycosylated flavanones, whereas hydrolyzed extracts contain mainly phenolic acids and flavonols. The phenolic composition of some citrus peels and seeds was described for the first time. No clear relationship could be shown between the antioxidant activity and the phenolic composition of the extracts. Keywords:  Citrus fruits; byproducts \u2026",
                "The rate of detection of thyroid nodules and carcinomas has increased with the widespread use of ultrasonography (US), which is the mainstay for the detection and risk stratification of thyroid nodules as well as for providing guidance for their biopsy and nonsurgical treatment. The Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KSThR) published their first recommendations for the US-based diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules in 2011. These recommendations have been used as the standard guidelines for the past several years in Korea. Lately, the application of US has been further emphasized for the personalized management of patients with thyroid nodules. The Task Force on Thyroid Nodules of the KSThR has revised the recommendations for the ultrasound diagnosis and imaging-based management of thyroid nodules. The review and recommendations in this report have been based on a comprehensive analysis of the current literature and the consensus of experts.",
                "The CRISPR\/Cas9 system enables genome editing and somatic cell genetic screens in mammalian cells. We performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens in 33 cancer cell lines to identify genes essential for proliferation\/survival and found a strong correlation between increased gene copy number and decreased cell viability after genome editing. Within regions of copy-number gain, CRISPR\/Cas9 targeting of both expressed and unexpressed genes, as well as intergenic loci, led to significantly decreased cell proliferation through induction of a G2 cell-cycle arrest. By examining single-guide RNAs that map to multiple genomic sites, we found that this cell response to CRISPR\/Cas9 editing correlated strongly with the number of target loci. These observations indicate that genome targeting by CRISPR\/Cas9 elicits a gene-independent antiproliferative cell response. This effect has important practical implications \u2026",
                "Naturalized plants were identified and recorded in South Korea based on field surveys and related literatures. These plants consisted of 321 taxa in total, belonging to 40 families, 175 genera, 302 species, 15 varieties and 4 forms. Among the plants the family Compositae was dominant containing 68 taxa (21.2% of the total population) and Poaceae with 62 taxa (19.3%) successively. Most of the plants were herbs and only 7 taxa trees. 221 taxa (68.8%) appeared to have invaded the country during the third period (1964-2010). 41.8%(134 taxa) of the total population were originated from Europe. These invasive plants were assessed with the degree of naturalisation which was categorized as IV types.",
                "Fully rollable transparent nanogenerators have been developed using chemical vapor deposition\u2010grown large\u2010scale graphene sheets as transparent electrodes and piezoelectric ZnO\u2010nanorod arrays. The electrical and structural stability of the nanogenerators with excellent charge scavenging performance under external mechanical loads such as bending and rolling shows that graphene\u2010based nanogenerators are suitable for self\u2010powered rollable transparent device applications.",
                "This study developed a Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (SAPS) based on the existing internet and cellular phone addiction scales. For the development of this scale, 29 items (1.5 times the final number of items) were initially selected as preliminary items, based on the previous studies on internet\/phone addiction as well as the clinical experience of involved experts. The preliminary scale was administered to a nationally representative sample of 795 students in elementary, middle, and high schools across South Korea. Then, final 15 items were selected according to the reliability test results. The final scale consisted of four subdomains: (1) disturbance of adaptive functions, (2) virtual life orientation, (3) withdrawal, and (4) tolerance. The final scale indicated a high reliability with Cronbach's \u03b1 of .880. Support for the scale's criterion validity has been demonstrated by its relationship to the internet addiction scale, KS-II (r = .49). For the analysis of construct validity, we tested the Structural Equation Model. The results showed the four-factor structure to be valid (NFI = .943, TLI = .902, CFI = .902, RMSEA = .034). Smartphone addiction is gaining a greater spotlight as possibly a new form of addiction along with internet addiction. The SAPS appears to be a reliable and valid diagnostic scale for screening adolescents who may be at risk of smartphone addiction. Further implications and limitations are discussed.",
                "DNA hydroxylation catalyzed by Tet dioxygenases occurs abundantly in embryonic stem cells and neurons in mammals. However, its biological function in vivo is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Tet1 plays an important role in regulating neural progenitor cell proliferation in adult mouse brain. Mice lacking Tet1 exhibit impaired hippocampal neurogenesis accompanied by poor learning and memory. In adult neural progenitor cells deficient in Tet1, a cohort of genes involved in progenitor proliferation were hypermethylated and downregulated. Our results indicate that Tet1 is positively involved in the epigenetic regulation of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the adult brain."
