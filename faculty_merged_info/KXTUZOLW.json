Research in theoretical nuclear astrophysics My research group studies how neutron star observations\n\t    can be used to understand how neutrons and protons\n\t    interact and how nuclear physics plays a role in\n\t    astrophysical objects and processes. Recently, we have determined how the equation of state and superfluid\n\t\tnature of dense matter is determined by neutron star\n\t\tobservations, showed how tidal deformabilities are modified by\n\t\tstrong phase transitions, and combined modern theoretical results on neutron\n\t\tmatter and neutron star observations to make\n\t\tpredictions for neutron star tidal deformabilities for\n\t\tLIGO. 103 South College, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, UTK,\n        Knoxville, TN 37996 awsteiner utk . edu Built with Bootstrap and Octicons"
