He was a Robert H. Dicke fellow from 1996 until 1998 and an assistant professor from 1998 until 2001 at Princeton University. He joined the UC Berkeley Physics faculty as an associate professor in 2002. My general field of research is String Theory, which is an umbrella term for a worldwide effort in theoretical high-energy physics, ranging from a quest for the fundamental Laws of Nature, looking at gravity under extreme conditions, applications and new models for particle physics, extra dimensions, new techniques for solving strongly interacting quantum systems, and new areas of mathematical physics. My interests include various aspects of M-theory, F-theory, matrix-models, noncommutative Geometry, six-dimensional quantum field theories, S-duality, the fractional quantum Hall effect, infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to M-theory, twistors, and Number Theory. Contributions Recent contributions include a proposal for a supersymmetric Lagrangian that describes nonlocal interactions induced on M5-branes immersed in strong flux, an analysis of compactifications with S-duality twists, a new realization of the fractional quantum Hall effect using M5-branes, and computation of the index of ray-operators in 5d CFTs. Earlier contributions include observation of a connection between imaginary roots of the infinite dimensional Lie algebra E10 and brane charges in M-theory, analysis of orbifolds of M-theory in terms of E10, a conjecture about twisted partition functions of M-theory and E10, proposals for new nonlocal field theories from string theory (Puff Field Theory and Dipole Theory), analysis of twistor string theory in 3d, proposals for Seiberg-Witten curves for compactifications of 6d CFTs, connection between moduli spaces of compactified 6d CFTs and noncommutative instantons, topological terms on the Coulomb branch of the 6d (2,0)-theory, computation of current-current correlators in 4d and 6d CFTs, rudimentary analysis of chiral compactifications of 6d CFTs and compactification of 6d CFTs on 4-manifolds, analysis of zeroes of superpotentials in F-theory, analysis of toroidally compactified BFSS Matrix models, surface operators in 6d CFTs and an early look at their large N limit, and proposal of the 6d E-string.
