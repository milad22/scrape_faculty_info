                "We have measured the electron-energy-loss rate in an n-doped GaAs\u2212 Al x Ga 1\u2212 x As heterostructure by finding the power required to establish a steady-state temperature offset between the electrons and the lattice. The measurement utilizes the temperature dependence of the resistance as a self-thermometer; heat is injected by an additional dc current. We find that for our sample the energy relaxation rate below 1 K is \u03c4 \u025b\u2212 1=(2.5\u00d7 10 6) T 3 sec\u2212 1 K\u2212 3.",
                "The crossover from weak to strong localization in the resistance of quasi-1D conductors is observed for the first time with decreasing the temperature; it occurs when the phase-breaking length becomes comparable with the localization length. The signature of the strong-localization regime is an activation-type temperature dependence of the resistance and exponentially strong negative magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistance is well described by the theory of doubling of the localization length in quasi-1D conductors in strong fields; this provides a direct measurement of the localization length.",
                "The A 1 and A 2 transitions, which delineate the A 1 phase of superfluid He 3, are measured in magnetic fields up to 3 T over a wide range of pressures. At zero pressure the A 1\u2212 A 2 splitting is found to be smaller than at melting pressure by a factor of 5. Strong-coupling effects are similarly smaller by an order of magnitude.",
                "We have studied thin disordered metal films at low temperatures under nonequilibrium conditions. The electron temperature was raised above the lattice temperature by applying a dc bias. The Coulomb anomaly and weak localization were used as thermometers for the electrons. We confirm that at temperatures below 1 K the electron temperatures as derived from either the Coulomb anomaly or weak localization are consistent. The electron-phonon energy relaxation rate was measured to be proportional to T 3. Our results disagree with theoretical calculations of the electron-phonon rates for dirty metals which predict electron-phonon scattering rates proportional to T 4 for three-dimensional phonons."
