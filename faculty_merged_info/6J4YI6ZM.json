D 95, 023013 (2017), arXiv: 1608.01994 Tongyan Lin Ph.D, Harvard University, 2012 Office: MH 5210 tongyan@physics.ucsd.edu The existence of dark matter is the most striking evidence of physics beyond the standard model, yet the properties of dark matter are unknown. My research aims to address basic questions about dark matter, such as what kinds of non-gravitational interactions it has. My work uses theoretical and computational methods to develop new ways of testing properties of dark matter, whether by astrophysical observations, direct detection experiments, or at colliders. To this end, I have employed existing data and also proposed new searches for dark matter which could provide clues on the possible existence of dark sectors as well as inform our understanding of early universe cosmology."
