                "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with all features of the metabolic syndrome. Although deposition of excess triglycerides within liver cells, a hallmark of NAFLD, is associated with a loss of insulin sensitivity, it is not clear which cellular abnormality arises first. We have explored this in mice overexpressing carbohydrate responsive element\u2013binding protein (ChREBP). On a standard diet, mice overexpressing ChREBP remained insulin sensitive, despite increased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis\/fatty acid esterification and resultant hepatic steatosis (simple fatty liver). Lipidomic analysis revealed that the steatosis was associated with increased accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). In primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes, ChREBP overexpression induced expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of saturated fatty \u2026",
                "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) is a nuclear receptor expressed in tissues with high oxidative activity that plays a central role in metabolism. In this work, we investigated the effect of hepatocyte PPAR\u03b1 on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).We constructed a novel hepatocyte-specific PPAR\u03b1 knockout (Ppar\u03b1hep\u2212\/\u2212) mouse model. Using this novel model, we performed transcriptomic analysis following fenofibrate treatment. Next, we investigated which physiological challenges impact on PPAR\u03b1. Moreover, we measured the contribution of hepatocytic PPAR\u03b1 activity to whole-body metabolism and fibroblast growth factor 21 production during fasting. Finally, we determined the influence of hepatocyte-specific PPAR\u03b1 deficiency in different models of steatosis and during ageing.Hepatocyte PPAR\u03b1 deletion impaired fatty acid catabolism, resulting in hepatic lipid \u2026",
                "Changes in lifestyle are suspected to have strongly influenced the current obesity epidemic. Based on recent experimental, clinical, and epidemiological work, it has been proposed that some food contaminants may exert damaging effects on endocrine and metabolic functions, thereby promoting obesity and associated metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this work, we investigated the effect of one suspicious food contaminant, bisphenol A (BPA), in vivo. We used a transcriptomic approach in male CD1 mice exposed for 28 days to different doses of BPA (0, 5, 50, 500, and 5,000 \u03bcg\/kg\/day) through food contamination. Data analysis revealed a specific impact of low doses of BPA on the hepatic transcriptome, more particularly on genes involved in lipid synthesis. Strikingly, the effect of BPA on the expression of de novo lipogenesis followed a nonmonotonic dose\u2010response curve \u2026",
                "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles are known to be in complex with lipoproteins. As a result of this interaction, the low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) has been proposed as a potential entry factor for HCV; however, its implication in virus entry remains unclear. Here, we reinvestigated the role of the LDLR in the HCV life cycle by comparing virus entry to the mechanism of lipoprotein uptake. A small interfering RNA targeting the LDLR in Huh\u20107 cells reduced HCV infectivity, confirming that this receptor plays a role in the life cycle of HCV generated in cell culture. However, kinetics of internalization were much faster for lipoproteins than for infectious HCV particles. Furthermore, a decrease in HCV RNA replication was observed by blocking the LDLR with a specific antibody, and this was associated with an increase in the ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine in host cells. Nevertheless, a \u2026",
                "During the orchestrated process leading to mature erythrocytes, reticulocytes must synthesize large amounts of hemoglobin, while eliminating numerous cellular components. Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that play an important role in this process of specific elimination. To understand the mechanisms of proteolipidic sorting leading to their biogenesis, we have explored changes in the composition of exosomes released by reticulocytes during their differentiation, in parallel to their physical properties. By combining proteomic and lipidomic approaches, we found dramatic alterations in the composition of the exosomes retrieved over the course of a 7-day in vitro differentiation protocol. Our data support a previously proposed model, whereby in reticulocytes the biogenesis of exosomes involves several distinct mechanisms for the preferential recruitment of particular proteins and lipids and suggest that the \u2026",
                "Dietary cholesterol absorption contributes to a large part of the circulating cholesterol. However, the mechanism of sterol intestinal uptake is not clearly elucidated. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), major component in the control of cholesterol homeostasis, is expressed in the intestine, but its role in this organ remains unclear. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BI primarily in the intestine by using the mouse SR-BI gene under the control of intestinal specific \u201capoC-III enhancer coupled with apoA-IV promoter.\u201d We found SR-BI overexpression with respect to the natural protein along the intestine and at the top of the villosities. After a meal containing [14C]cholesterol and [3H]triolein, SR-BI transgenic mice presented a rise in intestinal absorption of both lipids that was not due to a defect in chylomicron clearance nor to a change in the bile flow or the bile acid content. Nevertheless, SR-BI \u2026",
                "Lipid autacoids derived from n-3\/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are some of the earliest signals triggered by an inflammatory reaction. They are acting also as essential regulators of numerous biological processes in physiological conditions. With regards to their importance, a robust and rapid procedure to quantify a large variety of PUFA metabolites, applicable to diverse biological components needed to be formulated. We have developed a simple methodology using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry allowing quantification of low-level of PUFA metabolites including bioactive mediators, inactive products and pathway biomarkers. Solid phase extraction was used for samples preparation with an extraction yield of 80% ranging from 65% to 98%. The method was optimized to obtain a rapid (8.5 min) and accurate separation of 26 molecules, with a very high sensitivity of detection and \u2026",
                "Biallelic inactivating mutations of the transcription factor 1 gene (TCF1), encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF1\u03b1) were identified in 50% of hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) phenotypically characterized by a striking steatosis. To understand the molecular basis of this aberrant lipid storage, we performed a microarray transcriptome analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and lipid profiling. In mutated HCA, we showed a repression of gluconeogenesis coordinated with an activation of glycolysis, citrate shuttle, and fatty acid synthesis predicting elevated rates of lipogenesis. Moreover, the strong down-regulation of liver fatty acid-binding protein suggests that impaired fatty acid trafficking may also contribute to the fatty phenotype. In addition, transcriptional profile analysis of the observed deregulated genes in non-HNF1\u03b1-mutated HCA as well as in non-tumor livers allowed \u2026",
                "Obesity and aging are characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity (IS) and muscle protein synthesis. Intramuscular ceramide accumulation has been implicated in insulin resistance during obesity. We aimed to measure IS, muscle ceramide level, protein synthesis, and activation of intracellular signaling pathways involved in translation initiation in male Wistar young (YR, 6\u2010month) and old (OR, 25\u2010month) rats receiving a low\u2010 (LFD) or a high\u2010fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. A corresponding cellular approach using C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate to induce intracellular ceramide deposition was taken. A decreased ability of adipose tissue to store lipids together with a reduced adipocyte diameter and a development of fibrosis were observed in OR after the HFD. Consequently, OR fed the HFD were insulin resistant, showed a strong increase in intramuscular ceramide level and a decrease in muscle protein \u2026",
                "In mice, activation of the transient receptor potential cation channels (TRP) TRPV1, TRPV4, and TRPA1 causes visceral hypersensitivity. These receptors and their agonists might be involved in development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, which activate TRPs, are present in colon tissues from patients with IBS and act as endogenous agonists to induce hypersensitivity.We analyzed colon biopsy samples from 40 patients with IBS (IBS biopsies) and 11 healthy individuals undergoing colorectal cancer screening (controls), collected during colonoscopy at the University of Bologna, Italy. Levels of the PUFA metabolites that activate TRPV1 (12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and leukotriene B4), TRPV4 (5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid [EET] and 8,9 \u2026"
