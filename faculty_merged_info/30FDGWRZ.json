                "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies\u2014a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly\u2014were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of \u2026",
                "The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes, including humans. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the \u223c120-megabase euchromatic portion of theDrosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome encodes \u223c13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegansgenome, but with comparable \u2026",
                "The recently commissioned Linac Coherent Light Source is an X-ray free-electron laser at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. It produces coherent soft and hard X-rays with peak brightness nearly ten orders of magnitude beyond conventional synchrotron sources and a range of pulse durations from 500 to< 10 fs (10\u2212 15 s). With these beam characteristics this light source is capable of imaging the structure and dynamics of matter at atomic size and timescales. The facility is now operating at X-ray wavelengths from 22 to 1.2 \u00c5 and is presently delivering this high-brilliance beam to a growing array of scientific researchers. We describe the operation and performance of this new \u2018fourth-generation light source\u2019.",
                "We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron\u2013positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward\u2013backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, m Z and \u0393 Z, and its couplings to fermions, for example the \u03c1 parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured: m Z= 91.1875\u00b10.0021 GeV, \u0393 Z= 2.4952\u00b10.0023 GeV, \u03c1 \u2113= 1.0050\u00b10.0010, sin 2 \u03b8 eff lept= 0.23153\u00b10.00016. The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840\u00b10.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions \u2026",
                "The pre-eminent reference on coagulation disorders is now in its thoroughly updated Fifth Edition. Written by more than 160 of the world's foremost authorities, this encyclopedic volume integrates basic science and clinical practice and details all that is currently known about blood clotting disorders and how to manage patients with these and related problems. This edition has been reorganized into smaller, more tightly focused chapters to help readers find information easily. A new co-editor, Samuel Z. Goldhaber, MD, has expanded the cardiology portion of the book. Other new features include a two-color page design and more than 100 full-color illustrations.",
