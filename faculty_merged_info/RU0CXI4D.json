                "Precipitation-hardened Cu-0.804Cr-0.063Zr alloy is a potential material to be used for the fabrication of heat sinks in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) applications. The softening temperature of these alloys is 500 \u00b0C, which makes it suitable for the fabrication of components subjected to high heat flux. During welding, the precipitates get completely dissolved in the melted zone, which results in lower hardness and softening temperature. The aim of this study was to understand the effects of electron beam welding (EBW) on weld bead geometry and mechanical properties of this alloy. Accelerating voltage, beam current, welding speed, and focusing distance were selected as input variables, and bead geometric parameters like bead width, bead penetration, and microhardness values of the fusion and heat-affected zones were considered as outputs.
