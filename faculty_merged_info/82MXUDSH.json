                "Graphene, a two dimensional monoatomic thick building block of a carbon allotrope, has emerged as an exotic material of the 21st century, and received world-wide attention due to its exceptional charge transport, thermal, optical, and mechanical properties. Graphene and its derivatives are being studied in nearly every field of science and engineering. Recent progress has shown that the graphene-based materials can have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic devices, chemical sensors, nanocomposites and energy storage. The aim of this review article is to provide a comprehensive scientific progress of graphene to date and evaluate its future perspective. Various synthesis processes of single layer graphene, graphene nanoribbons, chemically derived graphene, and graphene-based polymer and nano particle composites are reviewed. Their structural, thermal, optical, and electrical properties \u2026",
                "Ultralight multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) aerogel is fabricated from a wet gel of well-dispersed pristine MWCNTs. On the basis of a theoretical prediction that increasing interaction potential between CNTs lowers their critical concentration to form an infinite percolation network, poly(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate) (PTMSPMA) is used to disperse and functionalize MWCNTs where the subsequent hydrolysis and condensation of PTMSPMA introduces strong and permanent chemical bonding between MWCNTs. The interaction is both experimentally and theoretically proven to facilitate the formation of a MWCNT percolation network, which leads to the gelation of MWCNT dispersion at ultralow MWCNT concentration. After removing the liquid component from the MWCNT wet gel, the lightest ever free-standing MWCNT aerogel monolith with a density of 4 mg\/cm3 is obtained. The MWCNT aerogel has \u2026",
                "A complete dispersion of both single\u2010wall and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to individual tube level was achieved using a conjugated block copolymer without chemical modification of the pristine CNTs. The block copolymer contains two structural segments, a conjugated poly (3\u2010hexylthiophene)(P3HT) segment and a polystyrene (PS) segment. P3HT block forms \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with CNTs, while the polystyrene block provides a good solubility to the de\u2010bundled carbon nanotubes. This approach is generic for carbon nanotube dispersion.",
                "Regioregular poly (3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT) is a promising semiconductive material for low-cost, large-scale, and flexible electronics such as thin film solar cells and field-effect transistors. 1-3 In these devices, P3HT is usually deposited from its solutions and then crystallizes dynamically into polycrystalline thin films upon solidification. The crystalline structure and morphology of P3HT significantly affect the thin film charge transport properties and consequently dominate the device performance. Understanding P3HT crystallization and controlling the crystal dimension is important to improve device performance as well as to design new semiconductive polymers with high charge mobility. 4-6 Extensive work on the crystallization of P3HT reveals a very complex process influenced by many factors such as thermal treatments, 7, 8 solvents, 9, 10 film thickness, 11 and polymer molecular weight (Mn). 12-14 In searching \u2026",
                "We report ultrahigh density assembly of aligned single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) two-dimensional arrays via AC dielectrophoresis using high-quality surfactant-free and stable SWNT solutions. After optimization of frequency and trapping time, we can reproducibly control the linear density of the SWNT between prefabricated electrodes from 0.5 SWNT\/\u03bcm to more than 30 SWNT\/\u03bcm by tuning the concentration of the nanotubes in the solution. Our maximum density of 30 SWNT\/\u03bcm is the highest for aligned arrays via any solution processing technique reported so far. Further increase of SWNT concentration results in a dense array with multiple layers. We discuss how the orientation and density of the nanotubes vary with concentrations and channel lengths. Electrical measurement data show that the densely packed aligned arrays have low sheet resistances. Selective removal of metallic SWNTs via controlled \u2026",
                "By creating defects via oxygen plasma treatment, we demonstrate optical properties variation of single-layer MoS2. We found that, with increasing plasma exposure time, the photoluminescence (PL) evolves from very high intensity to complete quenching, accompanied by gradual reduction and broadening of MoS2 Raman modes, indicative of distortion of the MoS2 lattice after oxygen bombardment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study shows the appearance of the Mo6+ peak, suggesting the creation of MoO3 disordered regions in the MoS2 flake. Finally, using band structure calculations, we demonstrate that the creation of MoO3 disordered domains upon exposure to oxygen plasma leads to a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition in single-layer MoS2, which explains the observed PL quenching.",
                "In this work, we study the crystallization and electrical resistivity of the formed oxides in a Cu\/SiO2\/Si thin film after thermal oxidation by ex-situ annealing at different temperatures up to 1000 \u00b0C. Upon increasing the annealing temperature, from the X ray diffractogram the phase evolution Cu \u2192 Cu + Cu2O \u2192 Cu2O \u2192 Cu2O + CuO \u2192 CuO was detected. Pure Cu2O films are obtained at 200 \u00b0C, whereas uniform CuO films without structural surface defects such as terraces, kinks, porosity or cracks are obtained in the temperature range 300\u2013550 \u00b0C. In both oxides, crystallization improves with annealing temperature. A resistivity phase diagram, which is obtained from the current\u2013voltage response, is presented here. The resistivity was expected to increase linearly as a function of the annealing temperature due to evolution of oxides. However, anomalous decreases are observed at different temperatures ranges, this \u2026",
                "We fabricated large area infrared photodetector devices from thin film of chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets and studied their photoresponse as a function of laser position. We found that the photocurrent either increases, decreases, or remain almost zero depending upon the position of the laser spot with respect to the electrodes. The position sensitive photoresponse is explained by Schottky barrier modulation at the RGO film-electrode interface. The time response of the photocurrent is dramatically slower than single sheet of graphene possibly due to disorder from the chemical synthesis and interconnecting sheets.",
                "Achieving tunability of two dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) functions calls for the introduction of hybrid 2D materials by means of localized interactions with zero dimensional (0D) materials. A metal-semiconductor interface, as in gold (Au)-molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2), is of great interest from the standpoint of fundamental science as it constitutes an outstanding platform to investigate plasmonic-exciton interactions and charge transfer. The applied aspects of such systems introduce new options for electronics, photovoltaics, detectors, gas sensing, catalysis and biosensing. Here we consider pristine MoS 2 and study its interaction with Au nanoislands, resulting in local variations of photoluminescence (PL) in Au-MoS 2 hybrid structures. By depositing monolayers of Au on MoS 2, we investigate the electronic structure of the resulting hybrid systems. We present strong evidence of PL \u2026",
                "We have demonstrated that the electrical property of single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can be significantly tuned from the semiconducting to the insulating regime via controlled exposure to oxygen plasma. The mobility, on-current and resistance of single-layer MoS2 devices were varied by up to four orders of magnitude by controlling the plasma exposure time. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory studies suggest that the significant variation of electronic properties is caused by the creation of insulating MoO3-rich disordered domains in the MoS2 sheet upon oxygen plasma exposure, leading to an exponential variation of resistance and mobility as a function of plasma exposure time. The resistance variation calculated using an effective medium model is in excellent agreement with the measurements. The simple approach described here can be used for the \u2026"

After finishing the Ph.D., Dr. Khondaker worked first as an assistant professor and then as an associate professor at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh from 1999 to 2001. In 2001, he started a postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Texas at Austin, where he worked on the nanoscale device fabrication and characterization. From 2003 to 2005, he worked as an assistant director at the center for nano and molecular science and technology at the University of Texas at Austin. He joined UCF in 2005. Highlights My research group is interested in the fabrication of nanoscale electrical and optical devices consisting of low dimensional chemical nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanowires, \u00a0nanotubes, and molecules and investigation of their electronic transport properties. Nanoscience and nanotechnology deals with the study, development, and application of materials, devices, and systems with dimensions in the 1\u2013100 nm range. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of materials at the nanoscale differ in fundamental and valuable ways from the properties of bulk matter. The many novel phenomena observed at the nanoscale are primarily the consequence of the appearance of quantum effects that begin to play an important role at length scales approaching a few nanometers. Our research effort is directed toward creating and characterizing improved materials, devices, and systems at the nanoscale that exploit these new properties. Specific areas of research interest includes: (i) Controlled assembly of carbon nanotubes and their device properties, (ii) Beyond Moors Law: Single electron transistors (iii) Chemically functionalized graphene: fundamentals and applications and (iv) Novel techniques for fabricating organic electronic and photovoltaic devices.
