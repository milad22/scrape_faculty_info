                "For over 30 years, researchers have investigated students\u2019 ideas about energy with the intent of reforming instructional practice. In this pursuit, Watts contributed an influential study with his 1983 paper \u201cSome alternative views of energy\u201d[Phys. Educ. 18, 213 (1983)]. Watts\u2019\u201calternative frameworks\u201d continue to be used for categorizing students\u2019 non-normative ideas about energy. Using a resources framework, we propose an alternate analysis of student responses from Watts\u2019 interviews. In our analysis, we show how students\u2019 activated resources about energy are disciplinarily productive. We suggest that fostering seeds of scientific understandings in students\u2019 ideas about energy may play an important role in their development of scientific literacy.",
                "When students share and explore chemistry ideas with others, they use gestures and their bodies to perform their understanding. As a publicly visible, spatio\u2013dynamic medium of expression, gestures and the body provide productive resources for imagining the submicroscopic, three-dimensional, and dynamic phenomena of chemistry together. In this paper, we analyze the role of gestures and the body as interactional resources in interactive spaces for collaborative meaning-making in chemistry. With our moment-by-moment analysis of video-recorded interviews, we demonstrate how creating spaces for, attending to, and interacting with students\u2019 gestures and bodily performances generate opportunities for learning. Implications for teaching and assessment that are responsive to students\u2019 ideas in chemistry are discussed.",
                "Energy is a crosscutting concept in science and features prominently in national science education documents. In the Next Generation Science Standards, the primary conceptual learning goal is for learners to conserve energy as they track the transfers and transformations of energy within, into, or out of the system of interest in complex physical processes. As part of tracking energy transfers among objects, learners should (i) distinguish energy from matter, including recognizing that energy flow does not uniformly align with the movement of matter, and should (ii) identify specific mechanisms by which energy is transferred among objects, such as mechanical work and thermal conduction. As part of tracking energy transformations within objects, learners should (iii) associate specific forms with specific models and indicators (e.g., kinetic energy with speed and\/or coordinated motion of molecules, thermal energy with \u2026",
                "This article explores the origins of metaphorical language to describe energy by reviewing the historical development of the concept by physicists since the early 19th century. In addition to examples of historical and contemporary use of metaphors in academic writing, observable manifestations of energy are identified as the origin of energy \u201cforms.\u201d The historical-philosophical review and presentation of examples from contemporary physics literature contribute a disciplinary foundation to recent claims about the productiveness of physics learners' use of metaphors and indicators to describe energy.",
                "We present a detailed account of interactional mechanisms that support participation in STEM disciplinary practices as an adult and a child explore a technology-enabled embodied learning environment for mathematics. Drawing on ethnomethodological studies of technology-rich workplaces, we trace the process of transforming a vague reference into a mutually available mathematical object: a covariant variable. Our analysis reveals that this mathematical object is an interactional achievement, configured via a reciprocal process of instructing one another\u2019s attention. In particular, we demonstrate how participants\u2019 explicit responsiveness to indexical and multimodal resources achieves this object.",
                "Proximal formative assessment, the just-in-time elicitation of students' ideas that informs ongoing instruction, is usually associated with the instructor in a formal classroom setting. However, the elicitation, assessment, and subsequent instruction that characterize proximal formative assessment are also seen in discourse among peers. We present a case in which secondary teachers in a professional development course at SPU are discussing energy flow in refrigerators. In this episode, a peer is invited to share her thinking (elicitation). Her idea that refrigerators move heat from a relatively cold compartment to a hotter environment is inappropriately judged as incorrect (assessment). The \"instruction\" (peer explanation) that follows is based on the second law of thermodynamics, and acts as corrective rather than collaborative.",
                "A growing program of research in science education acknowledges the beginnings of disciplinary reasoning in students\u2019 ideas and seeks to inform instruction that responds productively to these disciplinary progenitors in the moment to foster their development into sophisticated scientific practice. This dissertation examines secondary school students\u2019 ideas about energy for progenitors of disciplinary knowledge and practice. Previously, researchers argued that students\u2019 ideas about energy were constrained by stable and coherent conceptual structures that conflicted with an assumed unified scientific conception and therefore needed to be replaced. These researchers did not attend to the productive elements in students\u2019 ideas about energy.",
                "We examine the types of emergent language eighth grade students in rural Maine middle schools use when they discuss energy in their first experiences with Project-Based Inquiry Science: Energy, a research-based curriculum that uses a specific language for talking about energy. By comparative analysis of the language used by the curriculum materials to students\u2019 language, we find that students\u2019 talk is at times more aligned with a Stores and Transfer model of energy than the Forms model supported by the curriculum.",
                "We present a detailed account of the interactional work between a programming instructor and a middle school student that leads to the resolution of an elusive error in the student's code. By tracing the fine details of how this resolution came to be, we demonstrate how learning to debug in face-to-face interactions resembles a process of enskilment.",
                "Learning physics is socially organized through interactions with peers and more competent others. Instructors\u2019 and peers\u2019 assessment of and responsiveness to learners\u2019 ideas in the moment is critical for the collaborative construction of knowledge in physics. However, we still know little about how instructors and learners negotiate the value and productiveness of ideas. While to an outsider, some of the ideas physics learners discuss do not seem immediately valuable or productive for the problem being solved, Duckworth encourages us to pursue an \u201cinsider\u2019s view\u201d on how learners experience their ideas. Building on this notion, I pursue an \u201cinsider\u2019s view\u201d to better understand how peers and teachers experience each other\u2019s ideas. In particular, I examine the interactional methods and resources physics students use to express their ideas and to mark their own or others\u2019 ideas as wonderful or not-so-wonderful. I demonstrate how participants rely on a variety of multimodal communicational tools, including speech, words, gestures, and whiteboard inscriptions to negotiate wonderfulness, extending our current understanding of how peers and instructors are responsive to physics ideas in the moment."
