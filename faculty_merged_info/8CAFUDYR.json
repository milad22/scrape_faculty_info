                "We investigate zero-bias conductance peaks that arise from coalescing subgap Andreev states, consistent with emerging Majorana zero modes, in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor wires defined in a two-dimensional InAs\/Al heterostructure using top-down lithography and gating. The measurements indicate a hard superconducting gap, ballistic tunneling contact, and in-plane critical fields up to 3 T. Top-down lithography allows complex geometries, branched structures, and straightforward scaling to multicomponent devices compared to structures made from assembled nanowires."

After two years of research on semiconductor-based qubits at Harvard University, he joined UC Santa Barbara. There, he worked closely with Microsoft research on hybrid semiconductors\/superconductors heterostructures to study topological superconductivity. He is an expert in quantum materials and devices for computation technologies. He is currently an assistant professor of Physics at New York University. His current research interests are 1)\u00a0Novel states of matter at interfaces with focus on hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems 2)\u00a0Mesoscopic and nanoscale physics with emphasis on low dimensional semiconductors with focus on\u00a0new materials\/device development for quantum information 3)\u00a0Physics of integer and fractional quantum Hall effect and 4)\u00a0Epitaxial growth of compound superconducting metals-semiconductor, including high mobility two-dimensional electron systems and nano-plates using molecular beam epitaxy.

Such systems can serve as platforms for a wide variety of applications from Josephson field effect circuits to superconducting qubits and topological quantum computing. Our group develops atomically-tailored materials using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to realize sharp SN junctions that will later become part of functional quantum devices using micro-\/nano-fabrication techniques. Eventual characterization of those devices using low-temperature DC and RF measurements is used as the feedback for our materials growth processes. This cycle is continued until materials systems of perfect characteristics are grown for our specific applications. Current Openings Postdoctoral Associates Shabani Lab is seeking candidates for two postdoctoral associate positions focused on growth, fabrication and characterization of quantum materials and devices. The successful candidates will participate in scholarly activities including experimental condensed matter physics research and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. Ideal candidates should have a strong background in condensed matter physics and materials science with hands on experience in MBE materials growth, micro\/nanofabrication and RF\/DC low-temperature measurements. Interested applicants must submit a cover letter, CV and list of three references directly to Dr. Shabani. Graduate Students Shabani Lab has multiple openings for graduate students. If interested, please contact Dr.Shabani directly via e-mail. Skip back to main navigation Center for Quantum Phenomena The Center for Quantum Phenomena (CQP) is the third research center that is currently being formed in the Department. The research in CQP will be focused on condensed matter and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, as well as their applications to material science, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and quantum information technology. Its current members are Profs. Paul Chaikin, Andy Kent, Aditi Mitra, Javad Shabani, Tycho Sleator, Dan Stein, Andrew Wray and Jiehang Zhang.
