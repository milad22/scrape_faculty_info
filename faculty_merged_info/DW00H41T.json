                "Most information retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate information discovery. However, much knowledge work involves finding and re-using previously seen information. We describe the design and evaluation of a system, called Stuff I've Seen (SIS), that facilitates information re-use. This is accomplished in two ways. First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation."

My field of research is high-energy theoretical physics. I study the structures that arise in quantum field theory, especially conformal field theory, and in string theory. The goal which drives much of my research program is to understand the \"space of consistent theories\". Many questions stem from this goal: Given some way of describing a class of theories, how can we determine which examples are self-consistent? What are the relationships between different classes of theories? What can these quantum consistency conditions tell us about the laws which govern our universe? String theory, besides being the most promising candidate for a consistent quantum theory of gravity, is also a rich source of quantum field theory constructions relevant to the questions above. My research investigates these ideas and looks for connections among them and to other areas of physics and mathematics. Publications"
