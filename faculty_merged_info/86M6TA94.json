                "Ray Hall Title: Professor of Physics McL 24 (559) 278-8345 rhall@csufresno.edu PHYS 4BL 6PM to 8:50PM M Ph.D., U.C. Riverside The majority of my published research involved the D\u00d8 Collaboration (a 700+ member\n                  experimental\u00a0particle physics experiment at Fermilab) which took place from June 1989\u00a0to\n                  2010. A highlight of my\u00a0participation included the discovery of the top quark, a fundamental\n                  particle of nature. My current research centers on understanding best practices for teaching critical\n                  thinking and\u00a0methodologies of science, and how to best assess student learning outcomes\n                  in these areas.
