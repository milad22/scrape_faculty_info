                "The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and its applications. Today, ARPES experiments with 2-meV energy resolution and 0.2 angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-T c superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase \u2026",
                "Three-dimensional topological insulators are a new state of quantum matter with a bulk gap and odd number of relativistic Dirac fermions on the surface. By investigating the surface state of Bi2Te3 with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the surface state consists of a single nondegenerate Dirac cone. Furthermore, with appropriate hole doping, the Fermi level can be tuned to intersect only the surface states, indicating a full energy gap for the bulk states. Our results establish that Bi2Te3 is a simple model system for the three-dimensional topological insulator with a single Dirac cone on the surface. The large bulk gap of Bi2Te3 also points to promising potential for high-temperature spintronics applications.",
                "Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) represent an unusual state of quantum matter that can be viewed as \u201c3D graphene.\u201d In contrast to 2D Dirac fermions in graphene or on the surface of 3D topological insulators, TDSs possess 3D Dirac fermions in the bulk. By investigating the electronic structure of Na3Bi with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we detected 3D Dirac fermions with linear dispersions along all momentum directions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the robustness of 3D Dirac fermions in Na3Bi against in situ surface doping. Our results establish Na3Bi as a model system for 3D TDSs, which can serve as an ideal platform for the systematic study of quantum phase transitions between rich topological quantum states.",
                "Coupling between electrons and phonons (lattice vibrations) drives the formation of the electron pairs responsible for conventional superconductivity 1. The lack of direct evidence for electron\u2013phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics\u2014velocity and scattering rate\u2014for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50\u201380 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron \u2026",
                "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron\u2013electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe 2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe 2 on graphene\u2014orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than \u2026",
                "Angle-resolved photoemission experiments reveal evidence of an energy gap in the normal state excitation spectrum of the cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4. This gap exists only in underdoped samples and closes around the doping level at which the superconducting transition temperature Tc is a maximum. The momentum dependence and magnitude of the gap closely resemble those of the dx2\u2212y2 gap observed in the superconducting state. This observation is consistent with results from several other experimental techniques, which also indicate the presence of a gap in the normal state. Some possible theoretical explanations for this effect are reviewed.",
                "Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) are a recently proposed state of quantum matter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 that have attracted increasing attention in physics and materials science. A 3D TDS is not only a bulk analogue of graphene; it also exhibits non-trivial topology in its electronic structure that shares similarities with topological insulators. Moreover, a TDS can potentially be driven into other exotic phases (such as Weyl semimetals 1, 7, axion insulators 1, 4 and topological superconductors 8, 9), making it a unique parent compound for the study of these states and the phase transitions between them. Here, by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe a pair of 3D Dirac fermions in Cd 3 As 2, proving that it is a model 3D TDS. Compared with other 3D TDSs, for example, \u03b2-cristobalite BiO 2 (ref. 3) and Na 3 Bi (refs 4, 5), Cd 3 As 2 is stable and has much higher \u2026",
                "Superconducting gap anisotropy at least an order of magnitude larger than that of the conventional superconductors has been observed in the a-b plane of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. For samples with T c of 88 K, the gap size reaches a maximum of approximately 20 meV along the Cu-O bond direction, and a minimum of much smaller or vanishing magnitude 45 away. The experimental data are discussed within the context of various theoretical models. In particular, a detailed comparison with what is expected from a superconductor with a d x 2-y 2 order parameter is carried out, yielding a consistent picture.",
                "In addition to a bulk energy gap, topological insulators accommodate a conducting, linearly dispersed Dirac surface state. This state is predicted to become massive if time reversal symmetry is broken, and to become insulating if the Fermi energy is positioned inside both the surface and bulk gaps. We introduced magnetic dopants into the three-dimensional topological insulator dibismuth triselenide (Bi2Se3) to break the time reversal symmetry and further position the Fermi energy inside the gaps by simultaneous magnetic and charge doping. The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.",
                "Quantum systems in confined geometries are host to novel physical phenomena. Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors 1 and Dirac electrons in graphene 2. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and a potential route to valleytronics 6, 7, 8 in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX 2 (M= Mo, W; X= S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers 9, 10, 11, 12. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe 2 with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe 2 \u2026"

H., Pisitpipathsin, N., Unruan, M., Siriroj, S., He, R., Mo, S., Watcharapasorn, A., Yimnirun, R., Tokura, Y., Shen, Z., Hwang, H. Y., Maensiri, S., Meevasana, W. 2020 10 (1) : 16834 The discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the [Formula: see text] interface has set a new platform for all-oxide electronics which could potentially exhibit the interplay among charge, spin, orbital, superconductivity, ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. In this work, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and conductivity measurement, we found the reduction of 2DEGs and the changes of the conductivity nature of some ferroelectric oxides including insulating Nb-lightly-substituted [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] (BTO) and (Ca,Zr)-doped BTO across paraelectric-ferroelectric transition. We propose that these behaviours could be due to the increase of space-charge screening potential at the 2DEG\/ferroelectric regions which is a result of the realignment of ferroelectric polarisation upon light irradiation. This finding suggests an opportunity for controlling the 2DEG at a bare oxide surface (instead of interfacial system) by using both light and ferroelectricity.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Xu, K., Chen, S., He, Y., He, J., Tang, S., Jia, C., Ma, E. Y., Mo, S., Lu, D., Hashimoto, M., Devereaux, T. P., Shen, Z. 2020 The resistance of a conventional insulator diverges as temperature approaches zero. The peculiar low-temperature resistivity saturation in the 4f Kondo insulator (KI) SmB6 has spurred proposals of a correlation-driven topological Kondo insulator (TKI) with exotic ground states. However, the scarcity of model TKI material families leaves difficulties in disentangling key ingredients from irrelevant details. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study FeSb2, a correlated d-electron KI candidate that also exhibits a low-temperature resistivity saturation. On the (010) surface, we find a rich assemblage of metallic states with two-dimensional dispersion. Measurements of the bulk band structure reveal band renormalization, a large temperature-dependent band shift, and flat spectral features along certain high-symmetry directions, providing spectroscopic evidence for strong correlations. Our observations suggest that exotic insulating states resembling those in SmB6 and YbB12 may also exist in systems with d instead of f electrons.

Nano letters Rubio-Verdu, C., Garci A-Garci A, A. M., Ryu, H., Choi, D., Zaldi Var, J., Tang, S., Fan, B., Shen, Z., Mo, S., Pascual, J. I., Ugeda, M. M. 2020 Eigenstate multifractality is a distinctive feature of noninteracting disordered metals close to a metal-insulator transition, whose properties are expected to extend to superconductivity. While multifractality in three dimensions (3D) only develops near the critical point for specific strong-disorder strengths, multifractality in 2D systems is expected to be observable even for weak disorder. Here we provide evidence for multifractal features in the superconducting state of an intrinsic, weakly disordered single-layer NbSe2 by means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy. The superconducting gap, characterized by its width, depth, and coherence peaks' amplitude, shows a characteristic spatial modulation coincident with the periodicity of the quasiparticle interference pattern. The strong spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting gap width, proportional to the local order parameter in the weak-disorder regime, follows a log-normal statistical distribution as well as a power-law decay of the two-point correlation function, in agreement with our theoretical model. Furthermore, the experimental singularity spectrum f(alpha) shows anomalous scaling behavior typical from 2D weakly disordered systems.

A., Pei, D., Liu, Z., Shen, Z., Chen, Y. 2020 91 (3) : 033905 Two dimensional (2D) peak finding is a common practice in data analysis for physics experiments, which is typically achieved by computing the local derivatives. However, this method is inherently unstable when the local landscape is complicated or the signal-to-noise ratio of the data is low. In this work, we propose a new method in which the peak tracking task is formalized as an inverse problem, which thus can be solved with a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we show that the underlying physics principle of the experiments can be used to generate the training data. By generalizing the trained neural network on real experimental data, we show that the CNN method can achieve comparable or better results than traditional derivative based methods. This approach can be further generalized in different physics experiments when the physical process is known.

Nano letters Rugar, A. E., Lu, H., Dory, C., Sun, S., McQuade, P. J., Shen, Z., Melosh, N. A., Vuckovic, J. 2020 Group IV color centers in diamond have garnered great interest for their potential as optically active solid-state spin qubits. The future utilization of such emitters requires the development of precise site-controlled emitter generation techniques that are compatible with high-quality nanophotonic devices. This task is more challenging for color centers with large group IV impurity atoms, which are otherwise promising because of their predicted long spin coherence times without a dilution refrigerator. For example, when applied to the negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV-) center, conventional site-controlled color center generation methods either damage the diamond surface or yield bulk spectra with unexplained features. Here we demonstrate a novel method to generate site-controlled SnV- centers with clean bulk spectra. We shallowly implant Sn ions through a thin implantation mask and subsequently grow a layer of diamond via chemical vapor deposition. This method can be extended to other color centers and integrated with quantum nanophotonic device fabrication.

Science advances Wu, J., Zhuo, Z., Rong, X., Dai, K., Lebens-Higgins, Z., Sallis, S., Pan, F., Piper, L. F., Liu, G., Chuang, Y., Hussain, Z., Li, Q., Zeng, R., Shen, Z., Yang, W. 2020 6 (6) : eaaw3871 The oxygen redox (OR) activity is conventionally considered detrimental to the stability and kinetics of batteries. However, OR reactions are often confused by irreversible oxygen oxidation. Here, based on high-efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of both the transition metal and oxygen, we distinguish the lattice OR in Na0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 and compare it with Na2\/3[Mg1\/3Mn2\/3]O2. Both systems display strong lattice OR activities but with distinct electrochemical stability. The comparison shows that the substantial capacity drop in Na0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 stems from non-lattice oxygen oxidations, and its voltage decay from an increasing Mn redox contribution upon cycling, contrasting those in Na2\/3[Mg1\/3Mn2\/3]O2. We conclude that lattice OR is not the ringleader of the stability issue. Instead, irreversible oxygen oxidation and the changing cationic reactions lead to the capacity and voltage fade. We argue that lattice OR and other oxygen activities should\/could be studied and treated separately to achieve viable OR-based electrodes.

Here, we use X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory to show that the electronic structure of LaNiO2 and NdNiO2, while similar to the cuprates, includes significant distinctions. Unlike cuprates, the rare-earth spacer layer in the infinite-layer nickelate supports a weakly interacting three-dimensional 5d metallic state, which hybridizes with a quasi-two-dimensional, strongly correlated state with [Formula: see text] symmetry in the NiO2 layers. Thus, the infinite-layer nickelate can be regarded as a sibling of the rare-earth intermetallics13-15, which are well known for heavy fermion behaviour, where the NiO2 correlated layers play an analogous role to the 4f states in rare-earth heavy fermion compounds. This Kondo- or Anderson-lattice-like 'oxide-intermetallic' replaces the Mott insulator as the reference state from which superconductivity emerges upon doping.

A., Shen, Z., Chan, K., Tan, T., Chu, S., Cui, Y. 2020 To date, effective control over the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multicarbon products (C\u22652) has been very challenging. Here, we report a design principle for the creation of a selective yet robust catalytic interface for heterogeneous electrocatalysts in the reduction of CO2 to C2 oxygenates, demonstrated by rational tuning of an assembly of nitrogen-doped nanodiamonds and copper nanoparticles. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of ~63% towards C2 oxygenates at applied potentials of only -0.5V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, this catalyst shows an unprecedented persistent catalytic performance up to 120h, with steady current and only 19% activity decay. Density functional theory calculations show that CO binding is strengthened at the copper\/nanodiamond interface, suppressing CO desorption and promoting C2 production by lowering the apparent barrier for CO dimerization. The inherent compositional and electronic tunability of the catalyst assembly offers an unrivalled degree of control over the catalytic interface, and thereby the reaction energetics and kinetics.

Sr_{2}IrO_{4} is a 5d-electron counterpart of the cuprates in which both the pseudogap and a d-wave instability have been observed. Here, we report spectroscopic evidence for the presence of the third key player in electron-doped Sr_{2}IrO_{4}: electron-boson coupling. A\u00a0kink in nodal dispersion is observed with an energy scale of \u223c50\u2009\u2009meV. The strength of the kink changes with doping, but the energy scale remains the same. These results provide the first noncuprate platform for exploring the relationship between the pseudogap, d-wave instability, and electron-boson coupling in doped Mott insulators.

C., Ota, Y., Yamamoto, H., Shin, S., Hashimoto, M., Lu, D. H., Shen, Z., Tajima, S., Fujimori, A. 2019 9 : 16418 The isovalent-substituted iron pnictide compound SrFe2(As1-xPx)2 exhibits multiple evidence for nodal superconductivity via various experimental probes, such as the penetration depth, nuclear magnetic resonance and specific heat measurements. The direct identification of the nodal superconducting (SC) gap structure is challenging, partly because the presence of nodes is not protected by symmetry but instead caused by an accidental sign change of the order parameter, and also because of the three-dimensionality of the electronic structure. We have studied the SC gaps of SrFe2(As0.65P0.35)2 in three-dimensional momentum space by synchrotron and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The three hole Fermi surfaces (FSs) at the zone center have SC gaps with different magnitudes, whereas the SC gaps of the electron FSs at the zone corner are almost isotropic and kz-independent. As a possible nodal SC gap structure, we propose that the SC gap of the outer hole FS changes sign around the Z-X [(0, 0, 2\u03c0)\u2009-\u2009(\u03c0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0)] direction.

A. 2019 4 (10) : 2436\u201343 Low work function materials are essential for efficient thermionic energy converters (TECs), electronics, and electron emission devices. Much effort has been put into finding thermally stable material combinations that exhibit low work functions. Submonolayer coatings of alkali metals have proven to significantly reduce the work function; however, a work function less than 1 eV has not been reached. We report a record-low work function of 0.70 eV by inducing a surface photovoltage (SPV) in an n-type semiconductor with an alkali metal coating. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy indicates a work function of 1.06 eV for cesium\/oxygen-activated GaAs consistent with density functional theory model predictions. By illuminating with a 532 nm laser we induce an additional shift down to 0.70 eV due to the SPV. Further, we apply the SPV to the collector of an experimental TEC and demonstrate an I-V curve shift consistent with the collector work function reduction. This method opens an avenue toward efficient TECs and next-generation electron emission devices.

We observe the formation of one-dimensional interfaces between topologically nontrivial 1T' domains having different rotational orientations, as well as induced interfaces between topologically nontrivial 1T' and topologically trivial 1H phases. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show that 1T'\/1T' interface states are localized at domain boundaries, consistent with theoretically predicted unprotected interface modes that form dispersive bands in and around the energy gap of this quantum spin Hall insulator. We observe a qualitative difference in the experimental spectral line shape between topologically \"unprotected\" states at 1T'\/1T' domain boundaries and protected states at 1T'\/1H and 1T'\/vacuum boundaries in single-layer WSe2.

C., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Tokura, Y., Shen, Z. 2019 Quantum-relativistic materials often host electronic phenomena with exotic spatial distributions. In particular, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators feature topological boundary currents whose chirality is determined by the magnetization orientation. However, understanding the microscopic nature of edge vs. bulk currents has remained a challenge due to the emergence of multidomain states at the phase transitions. Here we use microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) to directly image chiral edge currents and phase transitions in a magnetic topological insulator. Our images reveal a dramatic change in the edge state structure and an unexpected microwave response at the topological phase transition between the Chern number [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] states, consistent with the emergence of an insulating [Formula: see text] state. The magnetic transition width is independent of film thickness, but the transition pattern is distinct in differently initiated field sweeps. This behavior suggests that the [Formula: see text] state has 2 surface states with Hall conductivities of [Formula: see text] but with opposite signs.

Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we study coherent phonons in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{0.92}Y_{0.08}Cu_{2}O_{8+\u03b4}. Sub-meV modulations of the electronic band structure are observed at frequencies of 3.94\u00b10.01 and 5.59\u00b10.06\u2009\u2009THz. For the dominant mode at 3.94\u00a0THz, the amplitude of the band energy oscillation weakly increases as a function of momentum away from the node. Theoretical calculations allow identifying the observed modes as CuO_{2}-derived A_{1g} phonons. The Bi- and Sr-derived A_{1g} modes which dominate Raman spectra in the relevant frequency range are absent in our measurements. This highlights the mode selectivity for phonons coupled to the near-Fermi-level electrons, which originate from CuO_{2} planes and dictate thermodynamic properties.

We image the unoccupied band structure as it evolves following a circularly polarized optical excitation and observe an asymmetric electron population in momentum space, which is the spectroscopic signature of a photocurrent. By analyzing the rise times of the population we identify which occupied and unoccupied electronic states are coupled by the optical excitation. We conclude that photocurrents can only be excited via resonant optical transitions coupling to spin-orbital textured states. Our work provides a microscopic understanding of how to control photocurrents in systems with spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry.

In electron-doped cuprate Nd2-x Ce x CuO4 (NCCO), an unexpected FS reconstruction has been observed in optimal- and overdoped regime (x = 0.15-0.17) by quantum oscillation measurements (QOM). This is all the more puzzling because neutron scattering suggests that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order, which is believed to reconstruct the FS, vanishes before x = 0.14. To reconcile the conflict, a widely discussed external magnetic-field-induced AFM long-range order in QOM explains the FS reconstruction as an extrinsic property. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) evidence of FS reconstruction in optimal- and overdoped NCCO. The observed FSs are in quantitative agreement with QOM, suggesting an intrinsic FS reconstruction without field. This reconstructed FS, despite its importance as a basis to understand electron-doped cuprates, cannot be explained under the traditional scheme. Furthermore, the energy gap of the reconstruction decreases rapidly near x = 0.17 like an order parameter, echoing the quantum critical doping in transport. The totality of the data points to a mysterious order between x = 0.14 and 0.17, whose appearance favors the FS reconstruction and disappearance defines the quantum critical doping. A recent topological proposal provides an ansatz for its origin.

F. 2019 5 (2) : eaau0073 Electron dynamics at interfaces is a subject of great scientific interest and technological importance. Detailed understanding of such dynamics requires access to the angstrom length scale defining interfaces and the femtosecond time scale characterizing interfacial motion of electrons. In this context, the most precise and general way to remotely measure charge dynamics is through the transient current flow and the associated electromagnetic radiation. Here, we present quantitative measurements of interfacial currents on the subnanometer length and femtosecond time scale by recording the emitted terahertz radiation following ultrafast laser excitation. We apply this method to interlayer charge transfer in heterostructures of two transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers less than 0.7 nm apart. We find that charge relaxation and separation occur in less than 100 fs. This approach allows us to unambiguously determine the direction of current flow, to demonstrate a charge transfer efficiency of order unity, and to characterize saturation effects.

H., Cui, Y. 2019 5 (2) : eaat8799 A two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator exhibits the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in which topologically protected conducting channels exist at the sample edges. Experimental signatures of the QSH effect have recently been reported in an atomically thin material, monolayer WTe2. Here, we directly image the local conductivity of monolayer WTe2 using microwave impedance microscopy, establishing beyond doubt that conduction is indeed strongly localized to the physical edges at temperatures up to 77 K and above. The edge conductivity shows no gap as a function of gate voltage, and is suppressed by magnetic field as expected. We observe additional conducting features which can be explained by edge states following boundaries between topologically trivial and nontrivial regions. These observations will be critical for interpreting and improving the properties of devices incorporating WTe2. Meanwhile, they reveal the robustness of the QSH channels and the potential to engineer them in the monolayer material platform.

In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the metallic state above the highest transition temperature is anomalous and is known as the \"strange metal.\" We studied this state using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. With increasing doping across a temperature-independent critical value pc ~ 0.19, we observed that near the Brillouin zone boundary, the strange metal, characterized by an incoherent spectral function, abruptly reconstructs into a more conventional metal with quasiparticles. Above the temperature of superconducting fluctuations, we found that the pseudogap also discontinuously collapses at the very same value of pc These observations suggest that the incoherent strange metal is a distinct state and a prerequisite for the pseudogap; such findings are incompatible with existing pseudogap quantum critical point scenarios.

G. 2019 Oxide materials are important candidates for the next generation of electronics due to a wide array of desired properties, which they can exhibit alone or when combined with other materials. While SrTiO3 (STO) is often considered a prototypical oxide, it, too, hosts a wide array of unusual properties, including a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), which can form at the surface when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Using layer-by-layer growth of high-quality STO films, we show that the 2DEG only forms with the SrO termination and not with the TiO2 termination, contrary to expectation. This dichotomy of the observed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra is similarly seen in BaTiO3 (BTO), in which the 2DEG is only observed for BaO-terminated films. These results will allow for a deeper understanding and better control of the electronic structure of titanate films, substrates, and heterostructures.

F. 9 : 3401 Transition metal dichalcogenide materials are unique in the wide variety of structural and electronic phases they exhibit in the two-dimensional limit. Here we show how such polymorphic flexibility can be used to achieve topological states at highly ordered phase boundaries in a new quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), 1T'-WSe2. We observe edge states at the crystallographically aligned interface between a quantum spin Hall insulating domain of 1T'-WSe2 and a semiconducting domain of 1H-WSe2 in contiguous single layers. The QSHI nature of single-layer 1T'-WSe2 is verified using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to determine band inversion around a 120\u2009meV energy gap, as well as scanning tunneling spectroscopy to directly image edge-state formation. Using this edge-state geometry we confirm the predicted penetration depth of one-dimensional interface states into the two-dimensional bulk of a QSHI for a well-specified crystallographic direction. These interfaces create opportunities for testing predictions of the microscopic behavior of topologically protected boundary states.

Multistep nucleation via metastable states could explain unexpectedly rapid nucleation in many contexts, yet experimental energy landscapes supporting such mechanisms are scarce, particularly at nanoscale dimensions. In this work, we measured the nucleation energy landscape of diamond during chemical vapor deposition, using a series of diamondoid molecules as atomically defined protonuclei. We find that 26-carbon atom clusters, which do not contain a single bulk atom, are postcritical nuclei and measure the nucleation barrier to be more than four orders of magnitude smaller than prior bulk estimations. These data support both classical and nonclassical concepts for multistep nucleation and growth during the gas-phase synthesis of diamond and other semiconductors. More broadly, these measurements provide experimental evidence that agrees with recent conceptual proposals of multistep nucleation pathways with metastable molecular precursors in diverse processes, ranging from cloud formation to protein crystallization, and nanoparticle synthesis.

The use of a modulated source allows for the measurement of photoconductivity in a single scan without a reference region on the sample, as well as removing most topographical artifacts and enhancing signal to noise as compared with unmodulated measurement. A broadband light source with a tunable monochrometer is then used to measure energy resolved photoconductivity with the same methodology. Finally, a pulsed optical source is used to measure local photo-carrier lifetimes via MIM, using the same 50 nm resolution tip.

A. 554 (7693) : 505-+ Mechanical stimuli can modify the energy landscape of chemical reactions and enable reaction pathways, offering a synthetic strategy that complements conventional chemistry. These mechanochemical mechanisms have been studied extensively in one-dimensional polymers under tensile stress using ring-opening and reorganization, polymer unzipping and disulfide reduction as model reactions. In these systems, the pulling force stretches chemical bonds, initiating the reaction. Additionally, it has been shown that forces orthogonal to the chemical bonds can alter the rate of bond dissociation. However, these bond activation mechanisms have not been possible under isotropic, compressive stress (that is, hydrostatic pressure). Here we show that mechanochemistry through isotropic compression is possible by molecularly engineering structures that can translate macroscopic isotropic stress into molecular-level anisotropic strain. We engineer molecules with mechanically heterogeneous components-a compressible ('soft') mechanophore and incompressible ('hard') ligands. In these 'molecular anvils', isotropic stress leads to relative motions of the rigid ligands, anisotropically deforming the compressible mechanophore and activating bonds. Conversely, rigid ligands in steric contact impede relative motion, blocking reactivity. We combine experiments and computations to demonstrate hydrostatic-pressure-driven redox reactions in metal-organic chalcogenides that incorporate molecular elements that have heterogeneous compressibility, in which bending of bond angles or shearing of adjacent chains activates the metal-chalcogen bonds, leading to the formation of the elemental metal. These results reveal an unexplored reaction mechanism and suggest possible strategies for high-specificity mechanosynthesis. PubMedID 29469090 Monochromatic Photocathodes from Graphene-Stabilized Diamondoids NANO LETTERS Yan, H., Narasimha, K. T., Denlinger, J., Li, F., Mo, S., Hohman, J., Dahl, J. P., Carlson, R. K., Tkachenko, B. A., Fokin, A. A., Schreiner, P. R., Hussain, Z., Shen, Z., Melosh, N. A. 18 (2) : 1099\u20131103 The monochromatic photoemission from diamondoid monolayers provides a new strategy to create electron sources with low energy dispersion and enables compact electron guns with high brightness and low beam emittance for aberration-free imaging, lithography, and accelerators. However, these potential applications are hindered by degradation of diamondoid monolayers under photon irradiation and electron bombardment. Here, we report a graphene-protected diamondoid monolayer photocathode with 4-fold enhancement of stability compared to the bare diamondoid counterpart. The single-layer graphene overcoating preserves the monochromaticity of the photoelectrons, showing 12.5 meV ful width at half-maximum distribution of kinetic energy. Importantly, the graphene coating effectively suppresses desorption of the diamondoid monolayer, enhancing its thermal stability by at least 100 K. Furthermore, by comparing the decay rate at different photon energies, we identify electron bombardment as the principle decay pathway for diamondoids under graphene protection. This provides a generic approach for stabilizing volatile species on photocathode surfaces, which could greatly improve performance of electron emitters.

Solid-state color centers are promising candidates for scalable quantum optics due to their long coherence time and small inhomogeneous broadening. However, once excited, color centers often decay through phonon-assisted processes, limiting the efficiency of single-photon generation and photon-mediated entanglement generation. Herein, we demonstrate strong enhancement of spontaneous emission rate of a single silicon-vacancy center in diamond embedded within a monolithic optical cavity, reaching a regime in which the excited-state lifetime is dominated by spontaneous emission into the cavity mode. We observe 10-fold lifetime reduction and 42-fold enhancement in emission intensity when the cavity is tuned into resonance with the optical transition of a single silicon-vacancy center, corresponding to 90% of the excited-state energy decay occurring through spontaneous emission into the cavity mode. We also demonstrate the largest coupling strength (g\/2\u03c0 = 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 GHz) and cooperativity (C = 1.4) to date for color-center-based cavity quantum electrodynamics systems, bringing the system closer to the strong coupling regime.

We demonstrate that 3 \u00d7 3 charge-density-wave (CDW) order persists despite distinct changes in the low energy electronic structure highlighted by the reduction in the number of bands crossing the Fermi energy and the corresponding modification of Fermi surface topology. Enhanced spin-orbit coupling and lattice distortion in the single-layer play a crucial role in the formation of CDW order. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the nature of CDW order in the two-dimensional limit. PubMedID 29300484 Modification of Transition-Metal Redox by Interstitial Water in Hexacyanometalate Electrodes for Sodium-Ion Batteries JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY Wu, J., Song, J., Dai, K., Zhuo, Z., Wray, L., Liu, G., Shen, Z., Zeng, R., Lu, Y., Yang, W. 139 (50) : 18358\u201364 A sodium-ion battery (SIB) solution is attractive for grid-scale electrical energy storage. Low-cost hexacyanometalate is a promising electrode material for SIBs because of its easy synthesis and open framework. Most hexacyanometalate-based SIBs work with aqueous electrolyte, and interstitial water in the material has been found to strongly affect the electrochemical profile, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we provide a comparative study of the transition-metal redox in hexacyanometalate electrodes with and without interstitial water based on soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. We found distinct transition-metal redox sequences in hydrated and anhydrated NaxMnFe(CN)6\u00b7zH2O. The Fe and Mn redox in hydrated electrodes are separated and are at different potentials, leading to two voltage plateaus. On the contrary, mixed Fe and Mn redox in the same potential range is found in the anhydrated system. This work reveals for the first time how transition-metal redox in batteries is strongly affected by interstitial molecules that are seemingly spectators. The results suggest a fundamental mechanism based on three competing factors that determine the transition-metal redox potentials. Because most hexacyanometalate electrodes contain water, this work directly reveals the mechanism of how interstitial molecules could define the electrochemical profile, especially for electrodes based on transition-metal redox with well-defined spin states.

S., Shen, Z. 357 (6346) : 71\u201374 The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a \"coherent lock-in\" measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. PubMedID 28684521 Visualizing dispersive features in 2D image via minimum gradient method REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS He, Y., Wang, Y., Shen, Z. 88 (7) : 073903 We developed a minimum gradient based method to track ridge features in a 2D image plot, which is a typical data representation in many momentum resolved spectroscopy experiments. Through both analytic formulation and numerical simulation, we compare this new method with existing DC (distribution curve) based and higher order derivative based analyses. We find that the new method has good noise resilience and enhanced contrast especially for weak intensity features and meanwhile preserves the quantitative local maxima information from the raw image. An algorithm is proposed to extract 1D ridge dispersion from the 2D image plot, whose quantitative application to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on high temperature superconductors is demonstrated.

A. 16 (3) : 349-355 Controlling inorganic structure and dimensionality through structure-directing agents is a versatile approach for new materials synthesis that has been used extensively for metal-organic frameworks and coordination polymers. However, the lack of 'solid' inorganic cores requires charge transport through single-atom chains and\/or organic groups, limiting their electronic properties. Here, we report that strongly interacting diamondoid structure-directing agents guide the growth of hybrid metal-organic chalcogenide nanowires with solid inorganic cores having three-atom cross-sections, representing the smallest possible nanowires. The strong van der Waals attraction between diamondoids overcomes steric repulsion leading to a cis configuration at the active growth front, enabling face-on addition of precursors for nanowire elongation. These nanowires have band-like electronic properties, low effective carrier masses and three orders-of-magnitude conductivity modulation by hole doping. This discovery highlights a previously unexplored regime of structure-directing agents compared with traditional surfactant, block copolymer or metal-organic framework linkers.

M., Yan, H., Schreiner, P. R., Vuckovic, J., Shen, Z., Melosh, N., Chu, S. Color center-containing nanodiamonds have many applications in quantum technologies and biology. Diamondoids, molecular-sized diamonds have been used as seeds in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth. However, optimizing growth conditions to produce high crystal quality nanodiamonds with color centers requires varying growth conditions that often leads to ad-hoc and time-consuming, one-at-a-time testing of reaction conditions. In order to rapidly explore parameter space, we developed a microwave plasma CVD technique using a vertical, rather than horizontally oriented stage-substrate geometry. With this configuration, temperature, plasma density, and atomic hydrogen density vary continuously along the vertical axis of the substrate. This variation allowed rapid identification of growth parameters that yield single crystal diamonds down to 10 nm in size and 75 nm diameter optically active center silicon-vacancy (Si-V) nanoparticles. Furthermore, this method may provide a means of incorporating a wide variety of dopants in nanodiamonds without ion irradiation damage.

Y., Lee, D., Shen, Z. 8 The observation of replica bands in single-unit-cell FeSe on SrTiO3 (STO)(001) by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has led to the conjecture that the coupling between FeSe electrons and the STO phonons are responsible for the enhancement of Tc over other FeSe-based superconductors. However the recent observation of a similar superconducting gap in single-unit-cell FeSe\/STO(110) raised the question of whether a similar mechanism applies. Here we report the ARPES study of the electronic structure of FeSe\/STO(110). Similar to the results in FeSe\/STO(001), clear replica bands are observed. We also present a comparative study of STO(001) and STO(110) bare surfaces, and observe similar replica bands separated by approximately the same energy, indicating this coupling is a generic feature of the STO surfaces and interfaces. Our findings suggest that the large superconducting gaps observed in FeSe films grown on different STO surface terminations are likely enhanced by a common mechanism.

To elucidate the mechanisms behind the enhanced T_{c} in monolayer (1\u00a0ML) FeSe on SrTiO_{3} (STO), we grew highly strained 1\u00a0ML FeSe on the rectangular (100) face of rutile TiO_{2}, and observed the coexistence of replica bands and superconductivity with a T_{c} of 63\u00a0K. From the similar T_{c} between this system and 1ML FeSe on STO (001), we conclude that strain and dielectric constant are likely unimportant to the enhanced T_{c} in these systems. A systematic comparison of 1\u00a0ML FeSe on TiO_{2} with other systems in the FeSe family shows that while charge transfer alone can enhance T_{c}, it is only with the addition of interfacial electron-phonon coupling that T_{c} can be increased to the level seen in 1\u00a0ML FeSe on STO.

Over the past decade, the advances in grating-based soft X-ray spectrometers have revolutionized the soft X-ray spectroscopies in materials research. However, these novel spectrometers are mostly dedicated designs, which cannot be easily adopted for applications with diverging demands. Here we present a versatile spectrometer design concept based on the Hettrick-Underwood optical scheme that uses modular mechanical components. The spectrometer's optics chamber can be used with gratings operated in either inside or outside orders, and the detector assembly can be reconfigured accordingly. The spectrometer can be designed to have high spectral resolution, exceeding 10 000 resolving power when using small source (\u223c1\u03bcm) and detector pixels (\u223c5\u03bcm) with high line density gratings (\u223c3000 lines\/mm), or high throughput at moderate resolution. We report two such spectrometers with slightly different design goals and optical parameters in this paper. We show that the spectrometer with high throughput and large energy window is particularly useful for studying the sustainable energy materials. We demonstrate that the extensive resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) map of battery cathode material LiNi1\/3Co1\/3Mn1\/3O2 can be produced in few hours using such a spectrometer. Unlike analyzing only a handful of RIXS spectra taken at selected excitation photon energies across the elemental absorption edges to determine various spectral features like the localized dd excitations and non-resonant fluorescence emissions, these features can be easily identified in the RIXS maps. Studying such RIXS maps could reveal novel transition metal redox in battery compounds that are sometimes hard to be unambiguously identified in X-ray absorption and emission spectra. We propose that this modular spectrometer design can serve as the platform for further customization to meet specific scientific demands.

In contrast, other mainstream semiconductors lack stable oxides and must rely on deposited insulators, presenting numerous compatibility challenges. We demonstrate that layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors HfSe2 and ZrSe2 have band gaps of 0.9 to 1.2 eV (bulk to monolayer) and technologically desirable \"high-\u03ba\" native dielectrics HfO2 and ZrO2, respectively. We use spectroscopic and computational studies to elucidate their electronic band structure and then fabricate air-stable transistors down to three-layer thickness with careful processing and dielectric encapsulation. Electronic measurements reveal promising performance (on\/off ratio > 106; on current, ~30 \u03bcA\/\u03bcm), with native oxides reducing the effects of interfacial traps. These are the first 2D materials to demonstrate technologically relevant properties of silicon, in addition to unique compatibility with high-\u03ba dielectrics, and scaling benefits from their atomically thin nature.

F., Shen, Z. 117 (26) An extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has recently been observed in several nonmagnetic semimetals. Increasing experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that the XMR can be driven by either topological protection or electron-hole compensation. Here, by investigating the electronic structure of a XMR material, YSb, we present spectroscopic evidence for a special case which lacks topological protection and perfect electron-hole compensation. Further investigations reveal that a cooperative action of a substantial difference between electron and hole mobility and a moderate carrier compensation might contribute to the XMR in YSb.

A., Kao, C., Zhu, D., Lee, J. 113 (51) : 14645-14650 The existence of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in cuprate superconductors has now been established. However, the nature of the CDW ground state has remained uncertain because disorder and the presence of superconductivity typically limit the CDW correlation lengths to only a dozen unit cells or less. Here we explore the field-induced 3D CDW correlations in extremely pure detwinned crystals of YBa2Cu3O2 (YBCO) ortho-II and ortho-VIII at magnetic fields in excess of the resistive upper critical field ([Formula: see text]) where superconductivity is heavily suppressed. We observe that the 3D CDW is unidirectional and possesses a long in-plane correlation length as well as significant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes. It is significant that we observe only a single sharply defined transition at a critical field proportional to [Formula: see text], given that the field range used in this investigation overlaps with other high-field experiments including quantum oscillation measurements. The correlation volume is at least two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the zero-field CDW. This is by far the largest CDW correlation volume observed in any cuprate crystal and so is presumably representative of the high-field ground state of an \"ideal\" disorder-free cuprate.

R., Shen, Z. 117 (18) We report simultaneous transport and scanning microwave impedance microscopy to examine the correlation between transport quantization and filling of the bulk Landau levels in the quantum Hall regime in gated graphene devices. Surprisingly, a comparison of these measurements reveals that quantized transport typically occurs below the complete filling of bulk Landau levels, when the bulk is still conductive. This result points to a revised understanding of transport quantization when carriers are accumulated by gating. We discuss the implications on transport study of the quantum Hall effect in graphene and related topological states in other two-dimensional electron systems.

A., Gotlieb, K., Kemper, A. F., Rotundu, C. R., Birgeneau, R. J., Hussain, Z., Lee, D., Shen, Z., Lanzara, A. 7 Topological insulators host spin-polarized surface states born out of the energetic inversion of bulk bands driven by the spin-orbit interaction. Here we discover previously unidentified consequences of band-inversion on the surface electronic structure of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. By performing simultaneous spin, time, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we map the spin-polarized unoccupied electronic structure and identify a surface resonance which is distinct from the topological surface state, yet shares a similar spin-orbital texture with opposite orientation. Its momentum dependence and spin texture imply an intimate connection with the topological surface state. Calculations show these two distinct states can emerge from trivial Rashba-like states that change topology through the spin-orbit-induced band inversion. This work thus provides a compelling view of the coevolution of surface states through a topological phase transition, enabled by the unique capability of directly measuring the spin-polarized unoccupied band structure.

G., Li, W., Yi, M., Hashimoto, M., Lu, D. H., Devereaux, T. P., Lee, D., Shen, Z. 117 (11) Superconductivity originates from pairing of electrons near the Fermi energy. The Fermi surface topology and pairing symmetry are thus two pivotal characteristics of a superconductor. Superconductivity in one monolayer (1\u00a0ML) FeSe thin film has attracted great interest recently due to its intriguing interfacial properties and possibly high superconducting transition temperature over 65\u00a0K. Here, we report high-resolution measurements of the Fermi surface and superconducting gaps in 1\u00a0ML FeSe using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Two ellipselike electron pockets are clearly resolved overlapping with each other at the Brillouin zone corner. The superconducting gap is nodeless but moderately anisotropic, which puts strong constraint on determining the pairing symmetry. The gap maxima locate on the d_{xy} bands along the major axis of the ellipse and four gap minima are observed at the intersections of electron pockets. The gap maximum location combined with the Fermi surface geometry deviate from a single d-wave, extended s-wave or s_{\u00b1} gap function, suggesting an important role of the multiorbital nature of Fermi surface and orbital-dependent pairing in 1\u00a0ML FeSe. The gap minima location may be explained by a sign change on the electron pockets, or a competition between intra- and interorbital pairing.

Y., Cui, Y., Johnston, S., Yang, Y., Agarwal, K., Kelly, M. A., Shen, Z., Chen, X. 87 (9) A quantitative approach is used to determine an effective height of probe beyond which the capacitance contribution is not significant in microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). We compare the effective height for three different modes of measurement, i.e., capacitance C(l) (l is the tip-sample distance), derivative of capacitance (C'(l)), and second derivative of capacitance (C\u2033(l)). We discuss the effects of tip geometry and sample properties such as relative permittivity and sample height on the effective height with examples and analyze the implication on the spatial resolution of MIM. Finally, our results are verified by microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) measurement.

Y., Cui, Y., Chen, Y. 16 (8) : 4738-4745 Layered transition metal chalcogenides with large spin orbit coupling have recently sparked much interest due to their potential applications for electronic, optoelectronic, spintronics, and valleytronics. However, most current understanding of the electronic structure near band valleys in momentum space is based on either theoretical investigations or optical measurements, leaving the detailed band structure elusive. For example, the exact position of the conduction band valley of bulk MoS2 remains controversial. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution (micro-ARPES), we systematically imaged the conduction\/valence band structure evolution across representative chalcogenides MoS2, WS2, and WSe2, as well as the thickness dependent electronic structure from bulk to the monolayer limit. These results establish a solid basis to understand the underlying valley physics of these materials, and also provide a link between chalcogenide electronic band structure and their physical properties for potential valleytronics applications.

P., Sher, M., Jost, P., Kaes, M., Salinga, M., von Hoegen, A., Wuttig, M., Lindenberg, A. M. 117 (6) : 067601-? Many chalcogenide glasses undergo a breakdown in electronic resistance above a critical field strength. Known as threshold switching, this mechanism enables field-induced crystallization in emerging phase-change memory. Purely electronic as well as crystal nucleation assisted models have been employed to explain the electronic breakdown. Here, picosecond electric pulses are used to excite amorphous Ag_{4}In_{3}Sb_{67}Te_{26}. Field-dependent reversible changes in conductivity and pulse-driven crystallization are observed. The present results show that threshold switching can take place within the electric pulse on subpicosecond time scales-faster than crystals can nucleate. This supports purely electronic models of threshold switching and reveals potential applications as an ultrafast electronic switch.

Y., Shen, Z. 87 (6) Microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), a near-field microwave scanning probe technique, has become a powerful tool to characterize local electrical responses in solid state samples. We present the design of a new type of MIM sensor based on quartz tuning fork and electrochemically etched thin metal wires. Due to a higher aspect ratio tip and integration with tuning fork, such design achieves comparable MIM performance and enables easy self-sensing topography feedback in situations where the conventional optical feedback mechanism is not available, thus is complementary to microfabricated shielded stripline-type probes. The new design also enables stable differential mode MIM detection and multiple-frequency MIM measurements with a single sensor.

The combination of angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy, and optical absorption measurements reveal the atomic and electronic structures evolution and optical response of WSe2\/BLG. We observe that a bilayer of WSe2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor, when integrated in a BLG-based heterostructure, thus shifting the direct-indirect band gap crossover to trilayer WSe2. In the monolayer limit, WSe2 shows a spin-splitting of 475 meV in the valence band at the K point, the largest value observed among all the MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) materials. The exciton binding energy of monolayer-WSe2\/BLG is found to be 0.21 eV, a value that is orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional three-dimensional semiconductors, yet small as compared to other two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogennides (TMDCs) semiconductors. Finally, our finding regarding the overall modification of the electronic structure by an alkali metal surface electron doping opens a route to further control the electronic properties of TMDCs.

A. 11 (3) : 267-272 Electron emission is critical for a host of modern fabrication and analysis applications including mass spectrometry, electron imaging and nanopatterning. Here, we report that monolayers of diamondoids effectively confer dramatically enhanced field emission properties to metal surfaces. We attribute the improved emission to a significant reduction of the work function rather than a geometric enhancement. This effect depends on the particular diamondoid isomer, with [121]tetramantane-2-thiol reducing gold's work function from \u223c5.1\u2005eV to 1.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2005eV, corresponding to an increase in current by a factor of over 13,000. This reduction in work function is the largest reported for any organic species and also the largest for any air-stable compound. This effect was not observed for sp(3)-hybridized alkanes, nor for smaller diamondoid molecules. The magnitude of the enhancement, molecule specificity and elimination of gold metal rearrangement precludes geometric factors as the dominant contribution. Instead, we attribute this effect to the stable radical cation of diamondoids. Our computed enhancement due to a positively charged radical cation was in agreement with the measured work functions to within \u00b10.3\u2005eV, suggesting a new paradigm for low-work-function coatings based on the design of nanoparticles with stable radical cations.

T., Huang, D. J. 6 Measurements of spin excitations are essential for an understanding of spin-mediated pairing for superconductivity; and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) provides a considerable opportunity to probe high-energy spin excitations. However, whether RIXS correctly measures the collective spin excitations of doped superconducting cuprates remains under debate. Here we demonstrate distinct Raman- and fluorescence-like RIXS excitations of Bi1.5Pb0.6Sr1.54CaCu2O(8+\u03b4). Combining photon-energy and momentum dependent RIXS measurements with theoretical calculations using exact diagonalization provides conclusive evidence that the Raman-like RIXS excitations correspond to collective spin excitations, which are magnons in the undoped Mott insulators and evolve into paramagnons in doped superconducting compounds. In contrast, the fluorescence-like shifts are due primarily to the continuum of particle-hole excitations in the charge channel. Our results show that under the proper experimental conditions RIXS indeed can be used to probe paramagnons in doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors.

We developed a table-top vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser with 113.778 nm wavelength (10.897 eV) and demonstrated its viability as a photon source for high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This sub-nanosecond pulsed VUV laser operates at a repetition rate of 10 MHz, provides a flux of 2 \u00d7 10(12) photons\/s, and enables photoemission with energy and momentum resolutions better than 2 meV and 0.012 \u00c5(-1), respectively. Space-charge induced energy shifts and spectral broadenings can be reduced below 2 meV. The setup reaches electron momenta up to 1.2 \u00c5(-1), granting full access to the first Brillouin zone of most materials. Control over the linear polarization, repetition rate, and photon flux of the VUV source facilitates ARPES investigations of a broad range of quantum materials, bridging the application gap between contemporary low energy laser-based ARPES and synchrotron-based ARPES. We describe the principles and operational characteristics of this source and showcase its performance for rare earth metal tritellurides, high temperature cuprate superconductors, and iron-based superconductors.

Non-equilibrium conditions may lead to novel properties of materials with broken symmetry ground states not accessible in equilibrium as vividly demonstrated by non-linearly driven mid-infrared active phonon excitation. Potential energy surfaces of electronically excited states also allow to direct nuclear motion, but relaxation of the excess energy typically excites fluctuations leading to a reduced or even vanishing order parameter as characterized by an electronic energy gap. Here, using femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate a tendency towards transient stabilization of a charge density wave after near-infrared excitation, counteracting the suppression of order in the non-equilibrium state. Analysis of the dynamic electronic structure reveals a remaining energy gap in a highly excited transient state. Our observation can be explained by a competition between fluctuations in the electronically excited state, which tend to reduce order, and transiently enhanced Fermi surface nesting stabilizing the order.

The experimental realization of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetically-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 films stands out as a landmark of modern condensed matter physics. However, ultra-low temperatures down to few tens of mK are needed to reach the quantization of Hall resistance, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the ferromagnetic phase transition temperature of the films. Here, we systematically study the band structure of V-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 thin films by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and show unambiguously that the bulk valence band (BVB) maximum lies higher in energy than the surface state Dirac point.

Y., Cui, Y., Kelly, M. A., Nakamura, M., Kawasaki, M., Tokura, Y., Tang, Q., Zhang, K., Li, X., Shen, Z. 115 (26) Complex many-body interaction in perovskite manganites gives rise to a strong competition between ferromagnetic metallic and charge-ordered phases with nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity and glassy behaviors. Investigating this glassy state requires high-resolution imaging techniques with sufficient sensitivity and stability. Here, we present the results of a near-field microwave microscope imaging on the strain-driven glassy state in a manganite film. The high contrast between the two electrically distinct phases allows direct visualization of the phase separation. The low-temperature microscopic configurations differ upon cooling with different thermal histories. At sufficiently high temperatures, we observe switching between the two phases in either direction. The dynamic switching, however, stops below the glass transition temperature. Compared with the magnetization data, the phase separation was microscopically frozen, while spin relaxation was found in a short period of time.

F., Mo, S., Hussain, Z., Bourret-Courchesne, E., Lanzara, A., Hashimoto, M., Lu, D. H., Shen, Z., Birgeneau, R. J. 115 (25) We present a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the substitution dependence of the electronic structure of Rb_{0.8}Fe_{2}(Se_{1-z}S_{z})_{2} (z=0, 0.5, 1), where superconductivity is continuously suppressed into a metallic phase. Going from the nonsuperconducting Rb_{0.8}Fe_{2}S_{2} to superconducting Rb_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, we observe little change of the Fermi surface topology, but a reduction of the overall bandwidth by a factor of 2. Hence, for these heavily electron-doped iron chalcogenides, we have identified electron correlation as explicitly manifested in the quasiparticle bandwidth to be the important tuning parameter for superconductivity, and that moderate correlation is essential to achieving high T_{C}.

However, their nature at high fields inferred from nuclear magnetic resonance is distinct from that measured with x-ray scattering at zero and low fields. We combined a pulsed magnet with an x-ray free-electron laser to characterize the CDW in YBa2Cu3O6.67 via x-ray scattering in fields of up to 28 tesla. While the zero-field CDW order, which develops at temperatures below ~150 kelvin, is essentially two dimensional, at lower temperature and beyond 15 tesla, another three-dimensionally ordered CDW emerges. The field-induced CDW appears around the zero-field superconducting transition temperature; in contrast, the incommensurate in-plane ordering vector is field-independent. This implies that the two forms of CDW and high-temperature superconductivity are intimately linked.

In a magnetic insulator, where the magnetic order is tied to its bulk insulating property, it has been postulated that electrical properties are drastically different along the domain walls, where the order is inevitably disturbed. Here we report the discovery of highly conductive magnetic domain walls in a magnetic insulator, Nd2Ir2O7, that has an unusual all-in-all-out magnetic order, via transport and spatially resolved microwave impedance microscopy. The domain walls have a virtually temperature-independent sheet resistance of ~1 kilohm per square, show smooth morphology with no preferred orientation, are free from pinning by disorders, and have strong thermal and magnetic field responses that agree with expectations for all-in-all-out magnetic order.

A simple device is built from large-area monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition, transferred onto 20 nm HfO2 on Si, enabling high electric fields capacitive charge accumulation in the graphene. We first observed over 0.7 eV work function change due to electrostatic gating as measured by scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy and confirmed by conductivity measurements. The deposition of Cs\/O further reduced the work function, as measured by photoemission in an ultrahigh vacuum environment, which reaches nearly 1 eV, the lowest reported to date for a conductive, nondiamond material.

Y., Cui, Y. 10 (8) : 707-713 The ability to detect light over a broad spectral range is central to practical optoelectronic applications and has been successfully demonstrated with photodetectors of two-dimensional layered crystals such as graphene and MoS2. However, polarization sensitivity within such a photodetector remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a broadband photodetector using a layered black phosphorus transistor that is polarization-sensitive over a bandwidth from \u223c400\u2005nm to 3,750\u2005nm. The polarization sensitivity is due to the strong intrinsic linear dichroism, which arises from the in-plane optical anisotropy of this material. In this transistor geometry, a perpendicular built-in electric field induced by gating can spatially separate the photogenerated electrons and holes in the channel, effectively reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing the performance for linear dichroism photodetection. The use of anisotropic layered black phosphorus in polarization-sensitive photodetection might provide new functionalities in novel optical and optoelectronic device applications.

Y., Bryant, B., Tokunaga, Y., Aeppli, G., Tokura, Y., Shen, Z. 6 Interfaces and boundaries in condensed-matter systems often have electronic properties distinct from the bulk material and thus have become a topic of both fundamental scientific interest and technological importance. Here we identify, using microwave impedance microscopy, enhanced conductivity of charge-order domain walls in the layered manganite Pr(Sr0.1Ca0.9)2Mn2O7. We obtain a complete mesoscopic map of surface topography, crystalline orientation and electronic phase, and visualize the thermal phase transition between two charge-ordered phases. In both phases, charge-order domains occur with domain walls showing enhanced conductivity likely due to local lifting of the charge order. Finite element analysis shows that the resolved domain walls can be as narrow as few nanometres. The domain walls are stabilized by structural twins and have a strong history dependence, suggesting that they may be manipulated to create novel devices.

S., Shen, Z. 15 (6) : 4150-4154 Ultrathin FeSe films grown on SrTiO3 substrates are a recent milestone in atomic material engineering due to their important role in understanding unconventional superconductivity in Fe-based materials. By using femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we study phonon frequencies in ultrathin FeSe\/SrTiO3 films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. After optical excitation, we observe periodic modulations of the photoelectron spectrum as a function of pump-probe delay for 1-unit-cell, 3-unit-cell, and 60-unit-cell thick FeSe films. The frequencies of the coherent intensity oscillations increase from 5.00 \u00b1 0.02 to 5.25 \u00b1 0.02 THz with increasing film thickness. By comparing with previous works, we attribute this mode to the Se A1g phonon. The dominant mechanism for the phonon softening in 1-unit-cell thick FeSe films is a substrate-induced lattice strain. Our results demonstrate an abrupt phonon renormalization due to a lattice mismatch between the ultrathin film and the substrate.

P., Lee, W. 6 Ultrafast light pulses can modify electronic properties of quantum materials by perturbing the underlying, intertwined degrees of freedom. In particular, iron-based superconductors exhibit a strong coupling among electronic nematic fluctuations, spins and the lattice, serving as a playground for ultrafast manipulation. Here we use time-resolved X-ray scattering to measure the lattice dynamics of photoexcited BaFe2As2. On optical excitation, no signature of an ultrafast change of the crystal symmetry is observed, but the lattice oscillates rapidly in time due to the coherent excitation of an A1g mode that modulates the Fe-As-Fe bond angle. We directly quantify the coherent lattice dynamics and show that even a small photoinduced lattice distortion can induce notable changes in the electronic and magnetic properties. Our analysis implies that transient structural modification can be an effective tool for manipulating the electronic properties of multi-orbital systems, where electronic instabilities are sensitive to the orbital character of bands.

W., Zhang, S., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Kelly, M. A., Shen, Z. 6 The realization of quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells is considered a milestone in the discovery of topological insulators. Quantum spin Hall states are predicted to allow current flow at the edges of an insulating bulk, as demonstrated in various experiments. A key prediction yet to be experimentally verified is the breakdown of the edge conduction under broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we first establish a systematic framework for the magnetic field dependence of electrostatically gated quantum spin Hall devices. We then study edge conduction of an inverted quantum well device under broken time-reversal symmetry using microwave impedance microscopy, and compare our findings to a non-inverted device. At zero magnetic field, only the inverted device shows clear edge conduction in its local conductivity profile, consistent with theory. Surprisingly, the edge conduction persists up to 9\u2009T with little change. This indicates physics beyond simple quantum spin Hall model, including material-specific properties and possibly many-body effects.

F. 15 (4) : 2594-2599 Despite the weak nature of interlayer forces in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, their properties are highly dependent on the number of layers in the few-layer two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we present a combined scanning tunneling microscopy\/spectroscopy and GW theoretical study of the electronic structure of high quality single- and few-layer MoSe2 grown on bilayer graphene. We find that the electronic (quasiparticle) bandgap, a fundamental parameter for transport and optical phenomena, decreases by nearly one electronvolt when going from one layer to three due to interlayer coupling and screening effects. Our results paint a clear picture of the evolution of the electronic wave function hybridization in the valleys of both the valence and conduction bands as the number of layers is changed. This demonstrates the importance of layer number and electron-electron interactions on van der Waals heterostructures and helps to clarify how their electronic properties might be tuned in future 2D nanodevices.

We report findings of strong anomalies in both mutual inductance and inelastic Raman spectroscopy measurements of single-unit-cell FeSe film grown on Nb-doped SrTiO3, which occur near the temperature where the superconductinglike energy gap opens. Analysis suggests that the anomaly is associated with a broadened ferroelectric transition in a thin layer near the FeSe\/SrTiO3 interface. The coincidence of the ferroelectric transition and gap-opening temperatures adds credence to the central role played by the film-substrate interaction on the strong Cooper pairing in this system. We discuss scenarios that could explain such a coincidence.

P., Shen, Z. 14 (1) : 37-42 In the high-temperature (Tc) cuprate superconductors, a growing body of evidence suggests that the pseudogap phase, existing below the pseudogap temperature T(\u2217), is characterized by some broken electronic symmetries distinct from those associated with superconductivity. In particular, recent scattering experiments have suggested that charge ordering competes with superconductivity. However, no direct link of an interplay between the two phases has been identified from the important low-energy excitations. Here, we report an antagonistic singularity at Tc in the spectral weight of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 as compelling evidence for phase competition, which persists up to a high hole concentration p ~ 0.22. Comparison with theoretical calculations confirms that the singularity is a signature of competition between the order parameters for the pseudogap and superconductivity. The observation of the spectroscopic singularity at finite temperatures over a wide doping range provides new insights into the nature of the competitive interplay between the two orders and the complex phase diagram near the pseudogap critical point.

Q., Chu, C. W., Fisher, I. R., Si, Q., Shen, Z., Lu, D. H. 6 : 7777-? Establishing the appropriate theoretical framework for unconventional superconductivity in the iron-based materials requires correct understanding of both the electron correlation strength and the role of Fermi surfaces. This fundamental issue becomes especially relevant with the discovery of the iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure three representative iron chalcogenides, FeTe0.56Se0.44, monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO3 and K0.76Fe1.72Se2. We show that these superconductors are all strongly correlated, with an orbital-selective strong renormalization in the dxy bands despite having drastically different Fermi surface topologies. Furthermore, raising temperature brings all three compounds from a metallic state to a phase where the dxy orbital loses all spectral weight while other orbitals remain itinerant. These observations establish that iron chalcogenides display universal orbital-selective strong correlations that are insensitive to the Fermi surface topology, and are close to an orbital-selective Mott phase, hence placing strong constraints for theoretical understanding of iron-based superconductors.

F. 13 (12) : 1091-1095 Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics. Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron-electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects. Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe2 on graphene\u2014orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for MoSe2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations which include electron correlation effects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting TMDs.

P., Lee, D., Shen, Z. 515 (7526) : 245-U207 Films of iron selenide (FeSe) one unit cell thick grown on strontium titanate (SrTiO3 or STO) substrates have recently shown superconducting energy gaps opening at temperatures close to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77\u00a0kelvin), which is a record for the iron-based superconductors. The gap opening temperature usually sets the superconducting transition temperature Tc, as the gap signals the formation of Cooper pairs, the bound electron states responsible for superconductivity. To understand why Cooper pairs form at such high temperatures, we examine the role of the SrTiO3 substrate. Here we report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results that reveal an unexpected characteristic of the single-unit-cell FeSe\/SrTiO3 system: shake-off bands suggesting the presence of bosonic modes, most probably oxygen optical phonons in SrTiO3 (refs 5, 6, 7), which couple to the FeSe electrons with only a small momentum transfer. Such interfacial coupling assists superconductivity in most channels, including those mediated by spin fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that this coupling is responsible for raising the superconducting gap opening temperature in single-unit-cell FeSe\/SrTiO3.

L. 13 (7) : 677-681 Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) are a recently proposed state of quantum matter that have attracted increasing attention in physics and materials science. A 3D TDS is not only a bulk analogue of graphene; it also exhibits non-trivial topology in its electronic structure that shares similarities with topological insulators. Moreover, a TDS can potentially be driven into other exotic phases (such as Weyl semimetals, axion insulators and topological superconductors), making it a unique parent compound for the study of these states and the phase transitions between them. Here, by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe a pair of 3D Dirac fermions in Cd3As2, proving that it is a model 3D TDS. Compared with other 3D TDSs, for example, \u03b2-cristobalite BiO2 (ref. 3) and Na3Bi (refs 4, 5), Cd3As2 is stable and has much higher Fermi velocities. Furthermore, by in situ doping we have been able to tune its Fermi energy, making it a flexible platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena.

A., Howard, C. A., Pickard, C. J., Hashimoto, M., Lu, D. H., Mo, S., Kirchmann, P. S., Shen, Z. 5 There is a great deal of fundamental and practical interest in the possibility of inducing superconductivity in a monolayer of graphene. But while bulk graphite can be made to superconduct when certain metal atoms are intercalated between its graphene sheets, the same has not been achieved in a single layer. Moreover, there is a considerable debate about the precise mechanism of superconductivity in intercalated graphite. Here we report angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the superconducting graphite intercalation compound CaC6 that distinctly resolve both its intercalant-derived interlayer band and its graphene-derived \u03c0* band. Our results indicate the opening of a superconducting gap in the \u03c0* band and reveal a substantial contribution to the total electron-phonon-coupling strength from the \u03c0*-interlayer interband interaction. Combined with theoretical predictions, these results provide a complete account for the superconducting mechanism in graphite intercalation compounds and lend support to the idea of realizing superconducting graphene by creating an adatom superlattice.

L. 343 (6173) : 864-867 Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) represent an unusual state of quantum matter that can be viewed as \"3D graphene.\" In contrast to 2D Dirac fermions in graphene or on the surface of 3D topological insulators, TDSs possess 3D Dirac fermions in the bulk. By investigating the electronic structure of Na3Bi with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we detected 3D Dirac fermions with linear dispersions along all momentum directions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the robustness of 3D Dirac fermions in Na3Bi against in situ surface doping. Our results establish Na3Bi as a model system for 3D TDSs, which can serve as an ideal platform for the systematic study of quantum phase transitions between rich topological quantum states.

Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors and Dirac electrons in graphene. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a potential route to valleytronics in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M\u00a0=\u00a0Mo, W; X\u00a0=\u00a0S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe2 with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe2 towards a direct bandgap, as well as a larger gap size, than theoretically predicted. Moreover, our finding of a significant spin-splitting of \u223c180\u00a0meV at the valence band maximum of a monolayer MoSe2 film could expand its possible application to spintronic devices.

Nature communications Feng, Z. A., El Gabaly, F., Ye, X., Shen, Z., Chueh, W. C. 5 : 4374-? Electrochemical incorporation reactions are ubiquitous in energy storage and conversion devices based on mixed ionic and electronic conductors, such as lithium-ion batteries, solid-oxide fuel cells and water-splitting membranes. The two-way traffic of ions and electrons across the electrochemical interface, coupled with the bulk transport of mass and charge, has been challenging to understand. Here we report an investigation of the oxygen-ion incorporation pathway in CeO2-\u03b4 (ceria), one of the most recognized oxygen-deficient compounds, during hydrogen oxidation and water splitting. We probe the response of surface oxygen vacancies, electrons and adsorbates to the electrochemical polarization at the ceria-gas interface. We show that surface oxygen-ion transfer, mediated by oxygen vacancies, is fast. Furthermore, we infer that the electron transfer between cerium cations and hydroxyl ions is the rate-determining step. Our in operando observations reveal the precise roles of surface oxygen vacancy and electron defects in determining the rate of surface incorporation reactions.

F. 13 (12) : 1091\u201395 Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics. Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron-electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects. Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe2 on graphene\u2014orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for MoSe2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations which include electron correlation effects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting TMDs. PubMedID 25173579 Dynamic competition between spin-density wave order and superconductivity in underdoped Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe2As2. Nature communications Yi, M., Zhang, Y., Liu, Z., Ding, X., Chu, J., Kemper, A. F., Plonka, N., Moritz, B., Hashimoto, M., Mo, S., Hussain, Z., Devereaux, T. P., Fisher, I. R., Wen, H. H., Shen, Z., Lu, D. H. 5 : 3711-? An intriguing aspect of unconventional superconductivity is that it always appears in the vicinity of other competing phases, whose suppression brings the full emergence of superconductivity. In the iron pnictides, these competing phases are marked by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition and a collinear spin-density wave (SDW) transition. There has been macroscopic evidence for competition between these phases and superconductivity as the magnitude of both the orthorhombicity and magnetic moment are suppressed in the superconducting state. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on detwinned underdoped Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe2As2, we observe a coexistence of both the SDW gap and superconducting gap in the same electronic structure. Furthermore, our data reveal that following the onset of superconductivity, the SDW gap decreases in magnitude and shifts in a direction consistent with a reduction of the orbital anisotropy. This observation provides direct spectroscopic evidence for the dynamic competition between superconductivity and both SDW and electronic nematic orders in these materials.

A., Martin, M. C., Shen, Z., Schoenlein, R. W., Kaindl, R. A. 4 Self-organized electronically ordered phases are a recurring feature in correlated materials, resulting in, for example, fluctuating charge stripes whose role in high-TC superconductivity is under debate. However, the relevant cause-effect relations between real-space charge correlations and low-energy excitations remain hidden in time-averaged studies. Here we reveal ultrafast charge localization and lattice vibrational coupling as dynamic precursors of stripe formation in the model compound La(1.75)Sr(0.25)NiO4, using ultrafast and equilibrium mid-infrared spectroscopy. The opening of a pseudogap at a crossover temperature T* far above long-range stripe formation establishes the onset of electronic localization, which is accompanied by an enhanced Fano asymmetry of Ni-O stretch vibrations. Ultrafast excitation triggers a sub-picosecond dynamics exposing the synchronous modulation of electron-phonon coupling and charge localization. These results illuminate the role of localization in forming the pseudogap in nickelates, opening a path to understanding this mysterious phase in a broad class of complex oxides.

This state is energetically located 1.5 eV above the conduction band, which permits it to be directly excited by the output of a Ti:sapphire laser.

A. 29 (31) : 9790-9797 Diamondoids (nanometer-sized diamond-like hydrocarbons) are a novel class of carbon nanomaterials that exhibit negative electron affinity (NEA) and strong electron-phonon scattering. Surface-bound diamondoid monolayers exhibit monochromatic photoemission, a unique property that makes them ideal electron sources for electron-beam lithography and high-resolution electron microscopy. However, these applications are limited by the stability of the chemical bonding of diamondoids on surfaces. Here we demonstrate the stable covalent attachment of diamantane phosphonic dichloride on tungsten\/tungsten oxide surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that diamondoid-functionalized tungsten oxide films were stable up to 300-350 \u00b0C, a substantial improvement over conventional diamondoid thiolate monolayers on gold, which dissociate at 100-200 \u00b0C. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light stimulated photoemission from these diamondoid phosphonate monolayers exhibited a characteristic monochromatic NEA peak with 0.2 eV full width at half-maximum (fwhm) at room temperature, showing that the unique monochromatization property of diamondoids remained intact after attachment. Our results demonstrate that phosphonic dichloride functionality is a promising approach for forming stable diamondoid monolayers for elevated temperature and high-current applications such as electron emission and coatings in micro\/nano electromechanical systems (MEMS\/NEMS).

Site-dependent low-energy excitations arising from progressive emissions of a 70 meV lattice vibrational mode are resolved for the first time, providing a direct measurement of electron-lattice coupling strength. We show that such electron-lattice coupling causes doping-dependent distortions of the Cu-O-Cu bond angle, which sets the intrachain spin exchange interactions. Our results indicate that the lattice degrees of freedom are fully integrated into the electronic behavior in low-dimensional systems.

R., Cuk, T., Greene, R. L., Shen, Z., Hemley, R. J., Struzhkin, V. V. 84 (6) Diamond anvil cell techniques are now well established and powerful methods for measuring materials properties to very high pressure. However, high pressure resistivity measurements are challenging because the electrical contacts attached to the sample have to survive to extreme stress conditions. Until recently, experiments in a diamond anvil cell were mostly limited to non-hydrostatic or quasi-hydrostatic pressure media other than inert gases. We present here a solution to the problem by using focused ion beam ultrathin lithography for a diamond anvil cell loaded with inert gas (Ne) and show typical resistivity data. These ultrathin leads are deposited on the culet of the diamond and are attaching the sample to the anvil mechanically, therefore allowing for measurements in hydrostatic or nearly hydrostatic conditions of pressure using noble gases like Ne or He as pressure transmitting media.

X., Devereaux, T. P. 110 (12) We investigate the order parameter dynamics of the stripe-ordered nickelate, La_{1.75}Sr_{0.25}NiO_{4}, using time-resolved resonant x-ray diffraction. In spite of distinct spin and charge energy scales, the two order parameters' amplitude dynamics are found to be linked together due to strong coupling. Additionally, the vector nature of the spin sector introduces a longer reorientation time scale which is absent in the charge sector. These findings demonstrate that the correlation linking the symmetry-broken states does not unbind during the nonequilibrium process, and the time scales are not necessarily associated with the characteristic energy scales of individual degrees of freedom.

H., Yu, R., Riggs, S. C., Chu, J., Lv, B., Liu, Z. K., Lu, M., Cui, Y., Hashimoto, M., Mo, S., Hussain, Z., Chu, C. W., Fisher, I. R., Si, Q., Shen, Z. 110 (6) Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe the low-temperature state of the A(x)Fe(2-y)Se(2) (A=K, Rb) superconductors to exhibit an orbital-dependent renormalization of the bands near the Fermi level-the d(xy) bands heavily renormalized compared to the d(xz)\/d(yz) bands. Upon raising the temperature to above 150 K, the system evolves into a state in which the d(xy) bands have depleted spectral weight while the d(xz)\/d(yz) bands remain metallic. Combined with theoretical calculations, our observations can be consistently understood as a temperature-induced crossover from a metallic state at low temperatures to an orbital-selective Mott phase at high temperatures. Moreover, the fact that the superconducting state of A(x)Fe(2-y)Se(2) is near the boundary of such an orbital-selective Mott phase constrains the system to have sufficiently strong on-site Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling, highlighting the nontrivial role of electron correlation in this family of iron-based superconductors.

P., Hussain, Z., Shen, Z. 110 (3) The nature of metallicity and the level of electronic correlations in the antiferromagnetically ordered parent compounds are two important open issues for the iron-based superconductivity. We perform a temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Fe(1.02)Te, the parent compound for iron chalcogenide superconductors. Deep in the antiferromagnetic state, the spectra exhibit a \"peak-dip-hump\" line shape associated with two clearly separate branches of dispersion, characteristics of polarons seen in manganites and lightly doped cuprates. As temperature increases towards the N\u00e9el temperature (T(N)), we observe a decreasing renormalization of the peak dispersion and a counterintuitive sharpening of the hump linewidth, suggestive of an intimate connection between the weakening electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and antiferromagnetism. Our finding points to the highly correlated nature of the Fe(1.02)Te ground state featured by strong interactions among the charge, spin, and lattice and a good metallicity plausibly contributed by the coherent polaron motion.

Photon-enhanced thermionic emission is a method of solar-energy conversion that promises to combine photon and thermal processes into a single mechanism, overcoming fundamental limits on the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. Photon-enhanced thermionic emission relies on vacuum emission of photoexcited electrons that are in thermal equilibrium with a semiconductor lattice, avoiding challenging non-equilibrium requirements and exotic material properties. However, although previous work demonstrated the photon-enhanced thermionic emission effect, efficiency has until now remained very low. Here we describe electron-emission measurements on a GaAs\/AlGaAs heterostructure that introduces an internal interface, decoupling the basic physics of photon-enhanced thermionic emission from the vacuum emission process. Quantum efficiencies are dramatically higher than in previous experiments because of low interface recombination and are projected to increase another order of magnitude with more stable, low work-function coatings. The results highlight the effectiveness of the photon-enhanced thermionic emission process and demonstrate that efficient photon-enhanced thermionic emission is achievable, a key step towards realistic photon-enhanced thermionic emission based energy conversion.

A. 15 (34) : 14442-14446 The efficiency of thermionic energy converters is a strong function of the inter-electrode separation due to space-charge limitations. Here we demonstrate vacuum thermionic energy converters constructed using barium dispenser cathodes and thin film tungsten anodes, separated by size specific alumina microbeads for simple device fabrication and inter-electrode gap control. The current and device efficiency at the maximum power point are strongly dependent on the inter-electrode gap, with a maximum device efficiency of 0.61% observed for a gap on the order of 5 \u03bcm. Paths to further reductions in space charge and improved anode work function are outlined with potential for over an order of magnitude improvement in output power and efficiency.

P., Shen, Z. 109 (45) : 18332-18337 A detailed phenomenology of low energy excitations is a crucial starting point for microscopic understanding of complex materials, such as the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Because of its unique momentum-space discrimination, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is ideally suited for this task in the cuprates, where emergent phases, particularly superconductivity and the pseudogap, have anisotropic gap structure in momentum space. We present a comprehensive doping- and temperature-dependence ARPES study of spectral gaps in Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+\u03b4), covering much of the superconducting portion of the phase diagram. In the ground state, abrupt changes in near-nodal gap phenomenology give spectroscopic evidence for two potential quantum critical points, p = 0.19 for the pseudogap phase and p = 0.076 for another competing phase. Temperature dependence reveals that the pseudogap is not static below T(c) and exists p > 0.19 at higher temperatures. Our data imply a revised phase diagram that reconciles conflicting reports about the endpoint of the pseudogap in the literature, incorporates phase competition between the superconducting gap and pseudogap, and highlights distinct physics at the edge of the superconducting dome.

P., Kemper, A. F., Moritz, B., Devereaux, T. P., Lee, D., Shen, Z. X., Hussain, Z. 3 The dynamics of an order parameter's amplitude and phase determines the collective behaviour of novel states emerging in complex materials. Time- and momentum-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, by virtue of measuring material properties at atomic and electronic time scales out of equilibrium, can decouple entangled degrees of freedom by visualizing their corresponding dynamics in the time domain. Here we combine time-resolved femotosecond optical and resonant X-ray diffraction measurements on charge ordered La(1.75)Sr(0.25)NiO(4) to reveal unforeseen photoinduced phase fluctuations of the charge order parameter. Such fluctuations preserve long-range order without creating topological defects, distinct from thermal phase fluctuations near the critical temperature in equilibrium. Importantly, relaxation of the phase fluctuations is found to be an order of magnitude slower than that of the order parameter's amplitude fluctuations, and thus limits charge order recovery. This new aspect of phase fluctuations provides a more holistic view of the phase's importance in ordering phenomena of quantum matter.

M., Lee, W. S., Schmitt, F., Uchida, S., Fujita, K., Ishida, S., Nagaosa, N., Shen, Z. X., Devereaux, T. P. 108 (16) The prevalent view of the high-temperature superconducting cuprates is that their essential low-energy physics is captured by local Coulomb interactions. However, this view been challenged recently by studies indicating the importance of longer-range components. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the importance of these components by examining the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction with acoustic phonons in connection with the recently discovered renormalization in the near-nodal low-energy (~8-15 meV) dispersion of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+\u03b4). By studying its nontrivial momentum and doping dependence we conclude a predominance of forward scattering arising from the direct interplay between the e-ph and extended Coulomb interactions. Our results thus demonstrate how the low-energy renormalization can provide a pathway to new insights into how these interactions interplay with one another and influence pairing and dynamics in the cuprates.

Recent theoretical work predicts that few-layer topological insulators are promising candidates for broadband and high-performance optoelectronic devices due to their spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac edge\/surface states, which are topologically protected against all time-reversal-invariant perturbations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes based on few-layer topological-insulator Bi(2)Se(3) nanostructures epitaxially grown on mica substrates by means of van der Waals epitaxy. The large, continuous, Bi(2)Se(3)-nanosheet transparent electrodes have single Dirac cone surface states, and exhibit sheet resistances as low as ~330 \u03a9 per square, with a transparency of more than 70% over a wide range of wavelengths. Furthermore, Bi(2)Se(3)-nanosheet transparent electrodes show high chemical and thermal stabilities as well as excellent mechanical durability, which may lead to novel optoelectronic devices with unique properties.

We studied p-type Bi2Se3, in which the metallic Dirac surface state and bulk conduction bands are unoccupied. Optical excitation leads to a metastable population at the bulk conduction band edge, which feeds a nonequilibrium population of the surface state persisting for >10 ps. This unusually long-lived population of a metallic Dirac surface state with spin texture may present a channel in which to drive transient spin-polarized currents.

From angle-resolved photoemission, we find that quantum confinement lifts the orbital degeneracy of the bulk band structure and leads to a 2DEG composed of ladders of subband states of both light and heavy carriers. Despite the strong spin-orbit coupling, our measurements provide a direct upper bound for the potential Rashba spin splitting of only \u0394k(parallel)}~0.02 \u00c5(-1) at the Fermi level. The polar nature of the KTaO3(100) surface appears to help mediate the formation of the 2DEG as compared to nonpolar SrTiO3(100).

T. 108 (3) We report on the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic order in a single crystal of CuO at a temperature of 207 K in response to strong optical excitation using femtosecond resonant x-ray diffraction. In the experiment, a femtosecond laser pulse induces a sudden, nonequilibrium increase in magnetic disorder. After a short delay ranging from 400 fs to 2 ps, we observe changes in the relative intensity of the magnetic ordering diffraction peaks that indicate a shift from a collinear commensurate phase to a spiral incommensurate phase. These results indicate that the ultimate speed for this antiferromagnetic reorientation transition in CuO is limited by the long-wavelength magnetic excitation connecting the two phases.

However, transport measurements have typically been dominated by residual bulk charge carriers originating from crystal defects or environmental doping, and these mask the contribution of surface carriers to charge transport in these materials. Controlling bulk carriers in current topological insulator materials, such as the binary sesquichalcogenides Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3, has been explored extensively by means of material doping and electrical gating, but limited progress has been made to achieve nanostructures with low bulk conductivity for electronic device applications. Here we demonstrate that the ternary sesquichalcogenide (Bi(x)Sb(1-x))2Te3 is a tunable topological insulator system. By tuning the ratio of bismuth to antimony, we are able to reduce the bulk carrier density by over two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the topological insulator properties. As a result, we observe a clear ambipolar gating effect in (Bi(x)Sb(1-x))2Te3 nanoplate field-effect transistor devices, similar to that observed in graphene field-effect transistor devices. The manipulation of carrier type and density in topological insulator nanostructures demonstrated here paves the way for the implementation of topological insulators in nanoelectronics and spintronics.

A., Shen, Z., Shabani, J., Shayegan, M. 107 (17) The edges of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime are divided into alternating metallic and insulating strips, with their widths determined by the energy gaps of the QHE states and the electrostatic Coulomb interaction. Local probing of these submicrometer features, however, is challenging due to the buried 2DEG structures. Using a newly developed microwave impedance microscope, we demonstrate the real-space conductivity mapping of the edge and bulk states. The sizes, positions, and field dependence of the edge strips around the sample perimeter agree quantitatively with the self-consistent electrostatic picture. The evolution of microwave images as a function of magnetic fields provides rich microscopic information around the \u03bd=2 QHE state.

Substituting Fe for a tiny amount of Cu (1%) induced an incommensurate magnetic order below 20 K in heavily overdoped La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4). Elastic neutron scattering suggested that this order cannot be ascribed to the localized spins on Cu or doped Fe. Angle-resolved photoemission revealed a strong Fermi surface nesting inherent in the pristine La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4) that likely drives this order. Our finding presents the first example of the long-sought \"itinerant-spin extreme\" of cuprates, where the spins of itinerant doped holes define the magnetic ordering ground state; it complements the current picture of cuprate spin physics that highlights the predominant role of localized spins at lower dopings.

R., Shen, Z., Cui, Y. 5 (6) : 4698-4703 Bismuth selenide (Bi(2)Se(3)) is a topological insulator with metallic surface states (SS) residing in a large bulk bandgap. In experiments, synthesized Bi(2)Se(3) is often heavily n-type doped due to selenium vacancies. Furthermore, it is discovered from experiments on bulk single crystals that Bi(2)Se(3) gets additional n-type doping after exposure to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the relative contribution of SS in total conductivity. In this article, transport measurements on Bi(2)Se(3) nanoribbons provide additional evidence of such environmental doping process. Systematic surface composition analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal fast formation and continuous growth of native oxide on Bi(2)Se(3) under ambient conditions. In addition to n-type doping at the surface, such surface oxidation is likely the material origin of the degradation of topological SS. Appropriate surface passivation or encapsulation may be required to probe topological SS of Bi(2)Se(3) by transport measurements.

P., Meevasana, W., Moore, R. G., Lu, D. H., Yoshida, Y., Eisaki, H., Devereaux, T. P., Hussain, Z., Shen, Z. 106 (16) Knowledge of the gap function is important to understand the pairing mechanism for high-temperature (T(c)) superconductivity. However, Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT STS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in the cuprates have reported contradictory gap functions, with FT-STS results deviating strongly from a canonical d(x2-y2) form. By applying an \"octet model\" analysis to autocorrelation ARPES, we reveal that a contradiction occurs because the octet model does not consider the effects of matrix elements and the pseudogap. This reaffirms the canonical d(x2-y2) superconducting gap around the node, which can be directly determined from ARPES. Further, our study suggests that the FT-STS reported fluctuating superconductivity around the node at far above T(c) is not necessary to explain the existence of the quasiparticle interference at low energy.

We studied the commencement of the pseudogap state at temperature T* using three different techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, polar Kerr effect, and time-resolved reflectivity) on the same optimally doped Bi2201 crystals. We observed the coincident, abrupt onset at T* of a particle-hole asymmetric antinodal gap in the electronic spectrum, a Kerr rotation in the reflected light polarization, and a change in the ultrafast relaxational dynamics, consistent with a phase transition. Upon further cooling, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity begin to grow close to the superconducting transition temperature (T(c)), entangled in an energy-momentum-dependent manner with the preexisting pseudogap features, ushering in a ground state with coexisting orders.

W. 106 (12) We report transport studies on a three-dimensional, 70-nm-thick HgTe layer, which is strained by epitaxial growth on a CdTe substrate. The strain induces a band gap in the otherwise semimetallic HgTe, which thus becomes a three-dimensional topological insulator. Contributions from residual bulk carriers to the transport properties of the gapped HgTe layer are negligible at mK temperatures. As a result, the sample exhibits a quantized Hall effect that results from the 2D single cone Dirac-like topological surface states.

The seminal recent discovery of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides LaAlO(3) and SrTiO(3) (ref. 4) represents an important milestone towards exploiting such properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity and large magnetoresistance, and can be patterned on the few-nanometre length scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as large as 8\u00d710(13)\u2009 cm(-2), can be formed at the bare SrTiO(3) surface. Furthermore, we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface to intense ultraviolet light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.

A. 9 (9) : 762-767 Solar-energy conversion usually takes one of two forms: the 'quantum' approach, which uses the large per-photon energy of solar radiation to excite electrons, as in photovoltaic cells, or the 'thermal' approach, which uses concentrated sunlight as a thermal-energy source to indirectly produce electricity using a heat engine. Here we present a new concept for solar electricity generation, photon-enhanced thermionic emission, which combines quantum and thermal mechanisms into a single physical process. The device is based on thermionic emission of photoexcited electrons from a semiconductor cathode at high temperature. Temperature-dependent photoemission-yield measurements from GaN show strong evidence for photon-enhanced thermionic emission, and calculated efficiencies for idealized devices can exceed the theoretical limits of single-junction photovoltaic cells. The proposed solar converter would operate at temperatures exceeding 200 degrees C, enabling its waste heat to be used to power a secondary thermal engine, boosting theoretical combined conversion efficiencies above 50%.

We introduced magnetic dopants into the three-dimensional topological insulator dibismuth triselenide (Bi2Se3) to break the time reversal symmetry and further position the Fermi energy inside the gaps by simultaneous magnetic and charge doping. The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.

Due to the weak van der Waals interaction between adjacent quintuple layers (QLs), the layered bismuth selenide (Bi(2)Se(3)), a single Dirac-cone topological insulator with a large bulk gap, can be exfoliated down to a few QLs. In this paper, we report the first controlled mechanical exfoliation of Bi(2)Se(3) nanoribbons (>50 QLs) by an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip down to a single QL. Microwave impedance microscopy is employed to map out the local conductivity of such ultrathin nanoribbons, showing drastic difference in sheet resistance between 1-2 QLs and 4-5 QLs. Transport measurement carried out on an exfoliated ( 50 QLs) ribbons. These AFM-exfoliated thin nanoribbons afford interesting candidates for studying the transition from quantum spin Hall surface to edge states.

The filamentary metallic domains align preferentially along certain crystal axes of the substrate, suggesting the anisotropic elastic strain as the key interaction in this system. The local impedance maps provide microscopic electrical information of the hysteretic behavior in strained thin film manganites, suggesting close connection between the glassy order and the colossal magnetoresistance effects at low temperatures.

The observed energy bands and Fermi surfaces are originated from the outer and inner CuO2 planes (OP and IP). The OP band is overdoped with a large d-wave gap around the node of \u03940\u223c43\u2009\u2009meV while the IP is underdoped with an even large gap of \u03940\u223c60\u2009\u2009meV. These energy gaps are much larger than those for the same doping level of the double-layer cuprates, which leads to the large Tc in Bi2223. We propose possible origins of the large superconducting gaps for the OP and IP: (1) minimal influence of out-of-plane disorder and a proximity effect and (2) interlayer tunneling of Cooper pairs between the OP and IP.

We present a systematic, doping-dependent study of a recently discovered low-energy kink in the nodal dispersion of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+\u03b4) (Bi-2212), which demonstrates the ubiquity and robustness of this kink in underdoped Bi-2212. The renormalization of the nodal velocity due to this kink becomes stronger with underdoping, revealing that the nodal Fermi velocity is nonuniversal, in contrast with assumed phenomenology. This is used together with laser ARPES measurements of the gap velocity (v2) to resolve discrepancies with thermal conductivity measurements.

The two-dimensional topological insulator phase was predicted in HgTe quantum wells and confirmed by transport measurements. Recently, Bi(2)Se(3) and related materials have been proposed as three-dimensional topological insulators with a single Dirac cone on the surface, protected by time-reversal symmetry. The topological surface states have been observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. However, few transport measurements in this context have been reported, presumably owing to the predominance of bulk carriers from crystal defects or thermal excitations. Here we show unambiguous transport evidence of topological surface states through periodic quantum interference effects in layered single-crystalline Bi(2)Se(3) nanoribbons, which have larger surface-to-volume ratios than bulk materials and can therefore manifest surface effects. Pronounced Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the magnetoresistance clearly demonstrate the coherent propagation of two-dimensional electrons around the perimeter of the nanoribbon surface, as expected from the topological nature of the surface states. The dominance of the primary h\/e oscillation, where h is Planck's constant and e is the electron charge, and its temperature dependence demonstrate the robustness of these states.

C., Cui, Y. 10 (1) : 329-333 Recent theoretical calculations and photoemission spectroscopy measurements on the bulk Bi(2)Se(3) material show that it is a three-dimensional topological insulator possessing conductive surface states with nondegenerate spins, attractive for dissipationless electronics and spintronics applications. Nanoscale topological insulator materials have a large surface-to-volume ratio that can manifest the conductive surface states and are promising candidates for devices. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of high quality single crystalline Bi(2)Se(3) nanomaterials with a variety of morphologies. The synthesis of Bi(2)Se(3) nanowires and nanoribbons employs Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Nanowires, which exhibit rough surfaces, are formed by stacking nanoplatelets along the axial direction of the wires. Nanoribbons are grown along [1120] direction with a rectangular cross-section and have diverse morphologies, including quasi-one-dimensional, sheetlike, zigzag and sawtooth shapes. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies on nanoribbons show atomically smooth surfaces with approximately 1 nm step edges, indicating single Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers. STM measurements reveal a honeycomb atomic lattice, suggesting that the STM tip couples not only to the top Se atomic layer, but also to the Bi atomic layer underneath, which opens up the possibility to investigate the contribution of different atomic orbitals to the topological surface states. Transport measurements of a single nanoribbon device (four terminal resistance and Hall resistance) show great promise for nanoribbons as candidates to study topological surface states.

The low-conductivity graphite oxide and its derivatives show significant electronic inhomogeneity. For the conductive chemical graphene, the residual defects lead to a systematic reduction of the microwave signals. In contrast, the signals on pristine graphene agree well with a lumped-element circuit model. The local impedance information can also be used to verify the electrical contact between overlapped graphene pieces.

A \"kink\" in the band dispersion is found in all three compounds but exhibits different momentum dependence for the single-layer and multilayer compounds, reminiscent to that of Bi-based cuprates. This layer number dependent renormalization effect strongly implies that the spin-resonance mode is unlikely to be responsible for the dramatic renormalization effect near the antinodal region.

The results clearly exhibit two distinct energy and temperature scales, namely, the gap around (pi, 0) of magnitude Delta* and the gap around the node characterized by the d-wave order parameter Delta0. In comparison with Bi2212 having higher Tc's, Delta0 is smaller, while Delta* and T* are similar. This result suggests that Delta* and T* are approximately material-independent properties of a single CuO2 plane, in contrast to the material-dependent Delta0, representing the pairing strength.

For the states originating from two inequivalent CuO2 layers, different energy scales are observed in dispersion kinks associated with the collective mode coupling, with the larger energy scale found in the electron (n-) doped state which also has stronger coupling strength.

By investigating the surface state of Bi2Te3 with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the surface state consists of a single nondegenerate Dirac cone. Furthermore, with appropriate hole doping, the Fermi level can be tuned to intersect only the surface states, indicating a full energy gap for the bulk states. Our results establish that Bi2Te3 is a simple model system for the three-dimensional topological insulator with a single Dirac cone on the surface. The large bulk gap of Bi2Te3 also points to promising potential for high-temperature spintronics applications.

In this paper, we briefly summarize the capabilities of state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in the field of experimental condensed matter physics. Due to the advancement of the detector technology and the high flux light sources, ARPES has become a powerful tool to study the low energy excitations of solids, especially those novel quantum materials in which many-body physics are at play. To benchmark today's state-of-the-art ARPES technique, we demonstrate that the precision of today's ARPES has advanced to a regime comparable to the bulk-sensitive de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements. Finally, as an example of new discoveries driven by the advancement of the ARPES technique, we summarize some of our recent ARPES measurements on underdoped high-T(c) superconducting cuprates, which have provided further insight into the complex pseudogap problem.

We used femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (trARPES) to optically pump and probe TbTe3, an excellent model system with which to study these effects. We drove a transient charge density wave melting, excited collective vibrations in TbTe3, and observed them through their time-, frequency-, and momentum-dependent influence on the electronic structure. We were able to identify the role of the observed collective vibration in the transition and to document the transition in real time. The information that we demonstrate as being accessible with trARPES will greatly enhance the understanding of all materials exhibiting collective phenomena.

R., Shen, Z. 455 (7209) : 81-84 The recent discovery of superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide family of compounds has generated intense interest. The layered crystal structure with transition-metal ions in planar square-lattice form and the discovery of spin-density-wave order near 130 K (refs 10, 11) seem to hint at a strong similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. An important current issue is the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of theories, distinguished by the underlying band structure, have been put forward: a local-moment antiferromagnetic ground state in the strong-coupling approach, and an itinerant ground state in the weak-coupling approach. The first approach stresses on-site correlations, proximity to a Mott-insulating state and, thus, the resemblance to the high-transition-temperature copper oxides, whereas the second approach emphasizes the itinerant-electron physics and the interplay between the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The debate over the two approaches is partly due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic structures. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of LaOFeP (superconducting transition temperature, T(c) = 5.9 K), the first-reported iron-based superconductor. Our results favour the itinerant ground state, albeit with band renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between these and copper-based superconductors.

X. 79 (6) This paper presents a detailed modeling and characterization of a microfabricated cantilever-based scanning microwave probe with separated excitation and sensing electrodes. Using finite-element analysis, we model the tip-sample interaction as small impedance changes between the tip electrode and the ground at our working frequencies near 1 GHz. The equivalent lumped elements of the cantilever can be determined by transmission line simulation of the matching network, which routes the cantilever signals to 50 Omega feed lines. In the microwave electronics, the background common-mode signal is canceled before the amplifier stage so that high sensitivity (below 1 aF capacitance changes) is obtained. Experimental characterization of the microwave microscope was performed on ion-implanted Si wafers and patterned semiconductor samples. Pure electrical or topographical signals can be obtained from different reflection modes of the probe.

Remarkably, the large mass renormalization has little dependence on either k or doping.

P., Hussain, Z., Shen, Z. 450 (7166) : 81-84 The superconducting gap--an energy scale tied to the superconducting phenomena--opens on the Fermi surface at the superconducting transition temperature (T(c)) in conventional BCS superconductors. In underdoped high-T(c) superconducting copper oxides, a pseudogap (whose relation to the superconducting gap remains a mystery) develops well above T(c) (refs 1, 2). Whether the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the superconducting gap above T(c) is one of the central questions in high-T(c) research. Although some experimental evidence suggests that the two gaps are distinct, this issue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly establish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as function of temperature. Here we report the discovery of such an energy gap in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta in the momentum space region overlooked in previous measurements. Near the diagonal of Cu-O bond direction (nodal direction), we found a gap that opens at T(c) and has a canonical (BCS-like) temperature dependence accompanied by the appearance of the so-called Bogoliubov quasi-particles, a classical signature of superconductivity. This is in sharp contrast to the pseudogap near the Cu-O bond direction (antinodal region) measured in earlier experiments.

A., Hussain, Z., Melosh, N. A., Shen, Z. 316 (5830) : 1460-1462 We found monochromatic electron photoemission from large-area self-assembled monolayers of a functionalized diamondoid, [121]tetramantane-6-thiol. Photoelectron spectra of the diamondoid monolayers exhibited a peak at the low-kinetic energy threshold; up to 68% of all emitted electrons were emitted within this single energy peak. The intensity of the emission peak is indicative of diamondoids being negative electron affinity materials. With an energy distribution width of less than 0.5 electron volts, this source of monochromatic electrons may find application in technologies such as electron microscopy, electron beam lithography, and field-emission flat-panel displays.

B., Leindecker, N., Kelly, M. A., Shen, Z. X. 78 (6) We present the design and experimental results of a near-field scanning microwave microscope working at a frequency of 1 GHz. Our microscope is unique in that the sensing probe is separated from the excitation electrode to significantly suppress the common-mode signal. Coplanar waveguides were patterned onto a silicon nitride cantilever interchangeable with atomic force microscope tips, which are robust for high speed scanning. In the contact mode that we are currently using, the numerical analysis shows that contrast comes from both the variation in local dielectric properties and the sample topography. Our microscope demonstrates the ability to achieve high resolution microwave images on buried structures, as well as nanoparticles, nanowires, and biological samples.

P., Hussain, Z., Shen, Z. 314 (5807) : 1910-1913 We used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy applied to deeply underdoped cuprate superconductors Bi2Sr2Ca(1-x)YxCu2O8 (Bi2212) to reveal the presence of two distinct energy gaps exhibiting different doping dependence. One gap, associated with the antinodal region where no coherent peak is observed, increased with underdoping, a behavior known for more than a decade and considered as the general gap behavior in the underdoped regime. The other gap, associated with the near-nodal regime where a coherent peak in the spectrum can be observed, did not increase with less doping, a behavior not previously observed in the single particle spectra. We propose a two-gap scenario in momentum space that is consistent with other experiments and may contain important information on the mechanism of high-transition temperature superconductivity.

While formal valence counting would imply this material to be an undoped insulator, it is a self-doped superconductor with a Tc of 60 K, possessing simultaneously both electron- and hole-doped Fermi-surface sheets. Intriguingly, the Fermi-surface sheet characterized by the much larger gap is the electron-doped one, which has a shape disfavoring two electronic features considered to be important for the pairing mechanism: the van Hove singularity and the antiferromagnetic (pi\/a, pi\/a) scattering.

J., Shen, Z. 96 (24) The electronic structure of the layered 4d transition metal oxide Sr2RhO4 is investigated by angle resolved photoemission. We find well-defined quasiparticle excitations with a highly anisotropic dispersion, suggesting a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi-liquid-like ground state. Markedly different from the isostructural Sr2RuO4, only two bands with dominant Rh 4dxz,zy character contribute to the Fermi surface. A quantitative analysis of the photoemission quasiparticle band structure is in excellent agreement with bulk data. In contrast, it is found that state-of-the-art density functional calculations in the local density approximation differ significantly from the experimental findings.

X. 96 (15) A recent highlight in the study of high-T(c) superconductors is the observation of band renormalization or self-energy effects on the quasiparticles. This is seen in the form of kinks in the quasiparticle dispersions as measured by photoemission and interpreted as signatures of collective bosonic modes coupling to the electrons. Here we compare for the first time the self-energies in an optimally doped and strongly overdoped, nonsuperconducting single-layer Bi-cuprate (Bi2Sr2CuO6). In addition to the appearance of a strong overall weakening, we also find that the weight of the self-energy in the overdoped system shifts to higher energies. We present evidence that this is related to a change in the coupling to c-axis phonons due to the rapid change of the c-axis screening in this doping range.

At the bulk structural phase transition temperature of 48 K, we find clear evidence for an electronic instability, gapping large parts of the underlying Fermi surface that appears to be nested. Metallic pockets are found to survive in the small, non-nested sections, constituting a low-temperature Fermi surface with 2 orders of magnitude smaller volume than in all other metallic ruthenates. The Fermi velocities and volumes of these pockets are in agreement with the results of complementary quantum oscillation measurements on the same crystal batches.

X. 438 (7067) : 474-478 A characteristic feature of the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors is the dichotomy between the electronic excitations along the nodal (diagonal) and antinodal (parallel to the Cu-O bonds) directions in momentum space, generally assumed to be linked to the 'd-wave' symmetry of the superconducting state. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements in the superconducting state have revealed a quasiparticle spectrum with a d-wave gap structure that exhibits a maximum along the antinodal direction and vanishes along the nodal direction. Subsequent measurements have shown that, at low doping levels, this gap structure persists even in the high-temperature metallic state, although the nodal points of the superconducting state spread out in finite 'Fermi arcs'. This is the so-called pseudogap phase, and it has been assumed that it is closely linked to the superconducting state, either by assigning it to fluctuating superconductivity or by invoking orders which are natural competitors of d-wave superconductors. Here we report experimental evidence that a very similar pseudogap state with a nodal-antinodal dichotomous character exists in a system that is markedly different from a superconductor: the ferromagnetic metallic groundstate of the colossal magnetoresistive bilayer manganite La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7. Our findings therefore cast doubt on the assumption that the pseudogap state in the copper oxides and the nodal-antinodal dichotomy are hallmarks of the superconductivity state.

X. 95 (14) Band dispersions and Fermi surfaces of the three-dimensional Mott-Hubbard system SrVO3 are directly observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. An observed spectral weight distribution near the Fermi level (E(F)) shows cylindrical Fermi surfaces as predicted by band-structure calculations. By comparing the experimental results with calculated surface electronic structures, we conclude that the obtained band dispersion reflects the bulk electronic structure. The enhanced effective electron mass obtained from the energy band near E(F) is consistent with the bulk thermodynamic properties and hence with the normal Fermi-liquid behavior of SrVO3.

We report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments which probe the 4a0 x 4a0 charge-ordered state discovered by scanning tunneling microscopy in the lightly doped cuprate superconductor Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. Our measurements reveal a marked dichotomy between the real- and momentum-space probes, for which charge ordering is emphasized in the tunneling measurements and photoemission is most sensitive to excitations near the node of the d-wave superconducting gap. These results emphasize the importance of momentum anisotropy in determining the complex electronic properties of the cuprates and places strong constraints on theoretical models of the charge-ordered state.

By measuring both the excitations near the Fermi energy as well as nonbonding states, we tracked the doping dependence of the electronic structure and the chemical potential with unprecedented precision. Our work reveals failures in the standard weakly interacting quasiparticle scenario, including the broad line shapes of the insulator and the apparently paradoxical shift of the chemical potential within the Mott gap. To resolve this, we develop a model where the quasiparticle is vanishingly small at half filling and grows upon doping, allowing us to unify properties such as the dispersion and Fermi wave vector with the chemical potential.

Phenomenological agreements with neutron and Raman experiments suggest that this mode is the B(1g) oxygen bond-buckling phonon. A theoretical calculation based on this assignment reproduces the electronic renormalization seen in the data.

X., Nagaosa, N. 93 (11) We explore manifestations of electron-phonon coupling on the electron spectral function for two phonon modes in the cuprates exhibiting strong renormalizations with temperature and doping. Applying simple symmetry considerations and kinematic constraints, we find that the out-of-plane, out-of-phase O buckling mode (B(1g)) involves small momentum transfers and couples strongly to electronic states near the antinode while the in-plane Cu-O breathing modes involve large momentum transfers and couples strongly to nodal electronic states. Band renormalization effects are found to be strongest in the superconducting state near the antinode, in full agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data.

We propose that this mechanism is the scattering of quasiparticles across the nearly parallel segments of the Fermi surface near the antinodes.

X. 300 (5617) : 303-307 C60 fullerides are challenging systems because both the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions are large on the energy scale of the expected narrow band width. We report angle-resolved photoemission data on the band dispersion for an alkali-doped C60 monolayer and a detailed comparison with theory. Compared to the maximum bare theoretical band width of 170 meV, the observed 100-meV dispersion is within the range of renormalization by electron-phonon coupling. This dispersion is only a fraction of the integrated peak width, revealing the importance of many-body effects. Additionally, measurements on the Fermi surface indicate the robustness of the Luttinger theorem even for materials with strong interactions.

X. 89 (16) The question of the anisotropy of the electron scattering in high temperature superconductors is investigated using high resolution angle-resolved photoemission data from Pb-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212) with suppressed superstructure. The scattering rate of low energy electrons along two bilayer-split pieces of the Fermi surface is measured (via the quasiparticle peak width), and no increase of scattering towards the antinode (pi,0) region is observed, contradicting the expectation from Q=(pi,pi) scattering. The results put a limit on the effects of Q=(pi,pi) scattering on the electronic structure of this overdoped superconductor with still very high T(c).

K., Kaneko, N., Greven, M., Onose, Y., Taguchi, Y., Tokura, Y. 88 (25) We present an angle-resolved photoemission doping dependence study of the n-type cuprate superconductor Nd(2-x)Ce(x)CuO(4+\/-delta), from the half-filled Mott insulator to the T(c) = 24 K superconductor. In Nd2CuO4, we reveal the charge-transfer band for the first time. As electrons are doped into the system, this feature's intensity decreases with the concomitant formation of near- E(F) spectral weight. At low doping, the Fermi surface is an electron-pocket (with volume approximately x) centered at (pi,0). Further doping leads to the creation of a new holelike Fermi surface (volume approximately 1+x) centered at (pi,pi). These findings shed light on the Mott gap, its doping evolution, as well as the anomalous transport properties of the n-type cuprates.

K., Islam, Z., Motoyama, N., Uchida, S. 88 (17) We report momentum-resolved charge excitations in a one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator studied using high resolution inelastic x-ray scattering over the entire Brillouin zone for the first time. Excitations at the insulating gap edge are found to be highly dispersive (momentum dependent) compared to excitations observed in two-dimensional Mott insulators. The observed dispersion in 1D cuprates ( SrCuO2 and Sr2CuO3) is consistent with charge excitations involving holons which is unique to spin-1\/2 quantum chain systems. These results point to the potential utility of momentum-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering in providing valuable information about electronic structure of strongly correlated insulators.

M., Lee, S., Damascelli, A., Lu, D. H., Feng, D. L., Shen, Z. X., Tajima, S. 88 (15) The first angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results from MgB2 single crystals are reported. Along the GammaK and GammaM directions, we observed three distinct dispersive features approaching the Fermi energy. These can be assigned to the theoretically predicted sigma (B 2p(x,y)) and pi (B 2p(z)) bands. In addition, a small parabolic-like band is detected around the Gamma point, which can be attributed to a surface-derived state. The overall agreement between our results and the band calculations suggests that the electronic structure of MgB2 is of a conventional nature, thus implying that electron correlations are weak and may be of little importance to superconductivity in this system.

However, instead of occurring near the (pi,0) region, as in the p-type materials, this pseudogap falls near the intersection of the underlying Fermi surface with the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone boundary.

X. 412 (6846) : 510-514 Coupling between electrons and phonons (lattice vibrations) drives the formation of the electron pairs responsible for conventional superconductivity. The lack of direct evidence for electron-phonon coupling in the electron dynamics of the high-transition-temperature superconductors has driven an intensive search for an alternative mechanism. A coupling of an electron with a phonon would result in an abrupt change of its velocity and scattering rate near the phonon energy. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe electron dynamics-velocity and scattering rate-for three different families of copper oxide superconductors. We see in all of these materials an abrupt change of electron velocity at 50-80 meV, which we cannot explain by any known process other than to invoke coupling with the phonons associated with the movement of the oxygen atoms. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling strongly influences the electron dynamics in the high-temperature superconductors, and must therefore be included in any microscopic theory of superconductivity.

In addition to the straight segments near ( pi,0) and ( 0,pi) antinodal regions, we have identified the existence of spectral weight along the [1,1] nodal direction in the electronic structure of both systems. This observation of nodal state, together with the straight segments near antinodal regions, reveals the dual nature of the electronic structure of stripes due to the competition of order and disorder.

This advance allows us to investigate the large a-b anisotropy of the in-plane electronic structure including, in particular, a 50% difference in the magnitude of the superconducting gap that scales with the energy position of the hump feature. This anisotropy, likely induced by the presence of the CuO chains, raises serious questions about attempts to quantitatively explain the YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) data from various experiments using models based on a perfectly square lattice.

Well-developed momentum-resolved spectroscopies such as photoemission or neutron scattering cannot probe the full Mott gap. High-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering revealed dispersive charge excitations across the Mott gap in a high-critical temperature parent cuprate (Ca(2)CuO(2)Cl(2)), shedding light on the anisotropy of the Mott gap. These charge excitations across the Mott gap can be described within the framework of the Hubbard model.

Doping dependence of the electronic structure of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) has been systematically studied in a series of photoemission measurements. The unusual spectral features in the underdoped regime are attributed to the formation of dynamical stripes and the opening of large and small pseudogaps.\nComment: 10 pages, 5 eps figures, Proceedings of NATO Advanced Research Workshop Bled 2000, Apr. 2000, Bled, Slovenia, \"Open Problems in Srongly Correlated Eletron Systems\", edited by P.

X., Kimura, T., Tokura, Y., Mao, Z. Q., Maeno, Y. 85 (24) : 5194\u201397 The electronic structure of Sr2RuO4 is investigated by high angular resolution ARPES at several incident photon energies. We address the controversial issues of the Fermi surface (FS) topology and the van Hove singularity at the M point, showing that a surface state and the replica of the primary FS due to sqrt[2]xsqrt[2] surface reconstruction are responsible for previous conflicting interpretations. The FS thus determined by ARPES is consistent with the de Haas-van Alphen results, and it provides additional information on the detailed shape of the alpha, beta, and gamma sheets.

X. 85 (12) : 2581\u201384 Quasiparticle dispersion in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 is investigated with improved angular resolution as a function of temperature and doping. Unlike the linear dispersion predicted by the band calculation, the data show a sharp break in dispersion at 50+\/-15 meV binding energy where the velocity changes by a factor of 2 or more. This change provides an energy scale in the quasiparticle self-energy. This break in dispersion is evident at and away from the d-wave node line, but the magnitude of the dispersion change decreases with temperature and with increasing doping.

N., Shen, Z. 289 (5477) : 277\u201381 We report that the doping and temperature dependence of photoemission spectra near the Brillouin zone boundary of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta)exhibit unexpected sensitivity to the superfluid density. In the superconducting state, the photoemission peak intensity as a function of doping scales with the superfluid density and the condensation energy. As a function of temperature, the peak intensity shows an abrupt behavior near the superconducting phase transition temperature where phase coherence sets in, rather than near the temperature where the gap opens. This anomalous manifestation of collective effects in single-particle spectroscopy raises important questions concerning the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity.

The electronic structure contains characteristic features consistent with other cuprates, such as the flat band at low energy near the Brillouin zone face. However, the low-energy excitation near the expected d-wave node region is strongly suppressed. The frequency-integrated spectral weight is confined inside one-dimensional segments in the momentum space (defined by horizontal momenta &cjs3539k(x)&cjs3539 = pi\/4 and vertical momenta &cjs3539k(y)&cjs3539 = pi\/4), deviating strongly from the more rounded Fermi surface expected from band calculations. This departure from the two-dimensional Fermi surface persists to a very high energy scale. These results provide important information for establishing a theory to understand the charge and spin ordering in cuprates and their relation with high-temperature superconductivity.

N., Bozovic, I., Shen, Z. 282 (5396) : 2067\u201372 An angle-resolved photoemission study is reported on Ca2CuO2Cl2, a parent compound of high-Tc superconductors. Analysis of the electron occupation probability, n(k), from the spectra shows a steep drop in spectral intensity across a contour that is close to the Fermi surface predicted by the band calculation. This analysis reveals a Fermi surface remnant, even though Ca2CuO2Cl2 is a Mott insulator. The lowest energy peak exhibits a dispersion with approximately the &cjs3539coskxa - coskya&cjs3539 form along this remnant Fermi surface. Together with the data from Dy-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta, these results suggest that this d-wave-like dispersion of the insulator is the underlying reason for the pseudo gap in the underdoped regime.

This gap exists only in underdoped samples and closes around the doping level at which the superconducting transition temperature Tc is a maximum. The momentum dependence and magnitude of the gap closely resemble those of the dx2-y2 gap observed in the superconducting state. This observation is consistent with results from several other experimental techniques, which also indicate the presence of a gap in the normal state.

O. 267 (5196) : 343-350 Over the last several years there have been great improvements in the energy resolution and detection efficiency of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. These improvements have made it possible to discover a number of fascinating features in the electronic structure of the high transition temperature (T(c)) superconductors: apparently bandlike Fermi surfaces, flat-band saddle points, and nested Fermi surface sections. Recent work suggests that these features, previously thought explainable only by one-electron band theory, may be better understood with a many-body approach. Furthermore, other properties of the high-T(c) superconductors, which are difficult to understand with band theory, are well described using a many-body picture. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy has also been used to investigate the nature of the superconducting pairing state, revealing an anisotropic gap consistent with a d-wave order parameter and fueling the current debate over s-wave versus d-wave superconductivity.
