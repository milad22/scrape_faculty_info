                "Data from solar neutrino and KamLAND experiments have led to a discovery of nonzero neutrino masses. Here we investigate what these data can tell us about neutrino interactions with matter, including the poorly constrained flavor-changing \u03bde\u2013\u03bd\u03c4 interactions. We give examples of the interaction parameters that are excluded by the solar\/KamLAND data and are beyond the reach of other experiments. We also demonstrate that flavor-changing interactions, at the allowed level, may profoundly modify the conversion probability for neutrinos of energy \u22726 MeV and the values of the mass parameter inferred from the data. The implications for future experiments are discussed.",
                "The conclusions of the Physics Working Group of the International Scoping Study of a future Neutrino Factory and super-beam facility (the ISS) are presented. The ISS was carried out by the international community between NuFact05,(the 7th International Workshop on Neutrino Factories and Super-beams, Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Rome, 21\u201326 June 2005) and NuFact06 (Ivine, CA, 24\u201330 August 2006). The physics case for an extensive experimental programme to understand the properties of the neutrino is presented and the role of high-precision measurements of neutrino oscillations within this programme is discussed in detail. The performance of second-generation super-beam experiments, beta-beam facilities and the Neutrino Factory are evaluated and a quantitative comparison of the discovery potential of the three classes of facility is presented. High-precision studies of the properties of the muon \u2026",

                "We consider in detail the effects of the 13-mixing (sin 2 \u03b8 13) and of the type of mass hierarchy\/ordering (sign [\u0394m 2 13]) on neutrino signals from the gravitational collapses of stars. The observables (characteristics of the energy spectra of \u03bd e and bar nu e events) sensitive to sin 2 \u03b8 13 and sign [\u0394m 2 13] have been calculated. They include the ratio of average energies of the spectra, r E\u2261 lang E rang\/lang \u0112 rang, the ratio of widths of the energy distributions, r \u0393\u2261 \u0393\/barGamma, the ratios of total numbers of \u03bd e and bar nu e events at low energies, S, and in the high energy tails, R tail. We construct and analyse scatter plots which show the predictions for the observables for different intervals of sin 2 \u03b8 13 and signs of \u0394m 2 13, taking into account uncertainties in the original neutrino spectra, the star density profile, etc. Regions in the space of observables r E, r \u0393, S, R tail exist in which certain mass hierarchy and \u2026",
                "We perform a detailed study of the Earth matter effects on supernova neutrinos. The dependences of these effects on the properties of the original neutrino fluxes, on the trajectory of the neutrinos inside the Earth and on the oscillation parameters are described. We show that, for a large fraction (\u223c 60%) of the possible arrival times of the signal, the neutrino flux crosses a substantial amount of the matter of the Earth at least for one of the existing detectors. For oscillation parameters from the LMA solution of the solar neutrino problem the Earth matter effect consists in an oscillatory modulation of the \u03bd \u0304 e and\/or \u03bd e energy spectra. The relative deviation with respect to the undistorted spectra can be as large as 20\u201330% for E\u2273 20 MeV and 70\u2013100% for E\u2273 40 MeV. For parameters from the SMA and LOW solutions the effect is localized at low energies (E\u2272 10 MeV) and is not larger than\u223c 10%. The Earth matter effects \u2026",
                "Neutrino oscillation experiments provide a unique tool for probing neutrino-matter interactions, especially those involving the tau neutrino. We describe the sensitivity of the present atmospheric neutrino data to these interactions in the framework of a three-flavor analysis. Compared to the two-flavor \u03bd \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 analyses, we find qualitatively new features, in particular, that large nonstandard interactions, comparable in strength to those in the Standard Model, can be consistent with the data. The existence of such interactions could imply a smaller value of the neutrino mixing angle and larger value of the mass-squared splitting than in the case of standard interactions only. This and other effects of nonstandard interactions may be tested in the next several years by MINOS, KamLAND, and solar neutrino experiments.",
                "The luminosity determination of electron\u2013positron colliders operating in the region of low-lying hadronic resonances (Ecm\u22431\u201310 GeV), such as BEPC\/BES, DA\u03a6NE, KEKB, PEP-II and VEPP-2M, requires the precision calculation of the Bhabha process at large scattering angles. In order to achieve a theoretical accuracy at a few 0.1% level, the inclusion of radiative corrections is mandatory. The phenomenologically relevant effect of QED corrections is taken into account in the framework of the Parton Shower (PS) method, which is employed both for cross section calculation and event generation. To test the reliability of the approach, a benchmark calculation, including exact O(\u03b1) corrections and higher-order leading logarithmic contributions, is developed as well and compared in detail with the PS predictions. The effect of O(\u03b1) next-to-leading and higher-order leading corrections is investigated in the presence of \u2026",
                "The presence of a tau component in the flux of atmospheric neutrinos inside the Earth, due to flavor oscillations, makes these neutrinos a valuable probe of interactions of the tau neutrino with matter. We study\u2014analytically and numerically\u2014the effects of nonstandard interactions in the \u03bd e\u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 sector on atmospheric neutrino oscillations, and calculate the bounds on the exotic couplings that follow from combining the atmospheric neutrino and K2K data. We find very good agreement between numerical results and analytical predictions derived from the underlying oscillation physics. While improving on existing accelerator bounds, our bounds still allow couplings of the size comparable to the standard weak interaction. The inclusion of new interactions expands the allowed region of the vacuum oscillation parameters towards smaller mixing angles, 0.2\u2272 sin\ufeff 2 \u03b8 23\u2272 0.7, and slightly larger mass squared splitting, 1.5\u00d7 \u2026",
                "We study the matter effects on oscillations of high-energy neutrinos in the Universe. A substantial effect can be produced by scattering of the neutrinos from cosmological sources (z\u2273 1) on the relic neutrino background, provided that the latter has large CP asymmetry: \u03b7\u2261(n \u03bd\u2212 n \u03bd)\/n \u03b3\u2273 1, where n \u03bd, n \u03bd and n \u03b3 are the concentrations of neutrinos, antineutrinos, and photons. We consider in detail the dynamics of conversion in the expanding neutrino background. Applications are given to the diffuse fluxes of neutrinos from gamma ray bursters, active galactic nuclei, and the decay of superheavy relics. We find that the vacuum oscillation probability can be modified by\u223c 10\u2212 20%, and in extreme cases allowed by present bounds on \u03b7 the effect can reach\u223c 1 0 0%. The signatures of matter effects would consist (i) for both active-active and active-sterile conversion, in a deviation of the numbers of events produced in a \u2026",
                "In the delayed explosion scenario of core-collapse supernovae, the accretion phase shows pronounced convective overturns and a low-multipole hydrodynamic instability, the standing accretion shock instability. These effects imprint detectable fast time variations on the emerging neutrino flux. Among existing detectors, IceCube is best suited to this task, providing an event rate of\u223c 1000 ms\u2212 1 during the accretion phase for a fiducial SN distance of 10 kpc, comparable to what could be achieved with a megaton water Cherenkov detector. If the standing accretion shock instability activity lasts for several hundred ms, a Fourier component with an amplitude of 1% of the average signal clearly sticks out from the shot noise. We analyze in detail the output of axially symmetric hydrodynamical simulations that predict much larger amplitudes up to frequencies of a few hundred Hz. If these models are roughly representative \u2026"
