                "A Bose-Einstein condensate was produced in a vapor of rubidium-87 atoms that was confined by magnetic fields and evaporatively cooled. The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.",
                "We have created vortices in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. The vortex state was created through a coherent process involving the spatial and temporal control of interconversion between the two components. Using an interference technique, we map the phase of the vortex state to confirm that it possesses angular momentum. We can create vortices in either of the two components and have observed differences in the dynamics and stability.",
                "A new apparatus featuring a double magneto-optic trap and an Ioffe-type magnetic trap was used to create condensates of 2\u00d7 10 6 atoms in either of the| F= 2, m= 2> or| F= 1, m=\u2212 1> spin states of 87 Rb. Overlapping condensates of the two states were also created using nearly lossless sympathetic cooling of one state via thermal contact with the other evaporatively cooled state. We observed that (i) the scattering length of the| 1,\u2212 1> state is positive,(ii) the rate constant for binary inelastic collisions between the two states is 2.2 (9)\u00d7 10\u2212 14 cm 3\/s, and (iii) there is a repulsive interaction between the two condensates. Similarities and differences between the behaviors of the two spin states are observed.",
                "The amplitude of the parity-nonconserving transition between the 6S and 7S states of cesium was precisely measured with the use of a spin-polarized atomic beam. This measurement gives Im(E1pnc)\/\u03b2 = \u22121.5935(56) millivolts per centimeter and provides an improved test of the standard model at low energy, including a value for the S parameter of \u22121.3(3)exp (11)theory. The nuclear spin-dependent contribution was 0.077(11) millivolts per centimeter; this contribution is a manifestation of parity violation in atomic nuclei and is a measurement of the long-sought anapole moment.",
                "We compared the amounts of learning achieved using two different instructional approaches under controlled conditions. We measured the learning of a specific set of topics and objectives when taught by 3 hours of traditional lecture given by an experienced highly rated instructor and 3 hours of instruction given by a trained but inexperienced instructor using instruction based on research in cognitive psychology and physics education. The comparison was made between two large sections (N = 267 and N = 271) of an introductory undergraduate physics course. We found increased student attendance, higher engagement, and more than twice the learning in the section taught using research-based instruction.",

                "Bose-Einstein condensation has been achieved in a magnetically trapped sample of 85 Rb atoms. Long-lived condensates of up to 10 4 atoms have been produced by using a magnetic-field-induced Feshbach resonance to reverse the sign of the scattering length. This system provides new opportunities for the study of condensate physics. The variation of the scattering length near the resonance has been used to magnetically tune the condensate self-interaction energy over a wide range, extending from strong repulsive to large attractive interactions. When the interactions were switched from repulsive to attractive, the condensate shrank to below our resolution limit, and after\u223c 5 ms emitted a burst of high-energy atoms.",
                "Bose-Einstein condensation, or BEC, has a long and rich history dating from the early 1920s. In this article we will trace briefly over this history and some of the developments in physics that made possible our successful pursuit of BEC in a gas. We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this discussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of: How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? Did you know it was going to work? How long did it take you and why? We will review some our favorites from among the experiments we have carried out with BEC. There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what \u2026",
                "We describe the first experiments that study in a controlled way the dynamics of distinguishable and interpenetrating bosonic quantum fluids. We work with a two-component system of Bose-Einstein condensates in the| F= 1, m f=\u2212 1> and| 2, 1> spin states of 87 Rb. The two condensates are created with complete spatial overlap, and in subsequent evolution they undergo complex relative motions that tend to preserve the total density profile. The motions quickly damp out, leaving the condensates in a steady state with a non-negligible (and adjustable) overlap region.",
                "We have produced a very cold sample of spin-polarized trapped atoms. The technique used dramatically simplifies the production of laser-cooled atoms. In this experiment, 1.8\u00d7 10 7 neutral cesium atoms were optically captured directly from a low-pressure vapor in a small glass cell. We then cooled the< 1-mm 3 cloud of trapped atoms and loaded it into a low-field magnetic trap in the same cell. The magnetically trapped atoms had an effective temperature as low as 1.1\u00b10.2 \u03bcK, which is the lowest kinetic temperature ever observed and far colder than any previous sample of trapped atoms."

                "Carl Wieman Cheriton Family Professor and Professor of Physics and of Education Research & Scholarship Carl Wieman holds a joint appointment as Professor of Physics and of the Graduate School of Education.  He has done extensive experimental research in atomic and optical physics.  His current intellectual focus is now on undergraduate physics and science education.  He has pioneered the use of experimental techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of various teaching strategies for physics and other sciences, and recently served as Associate Director for Science in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Graduate School of Education Carnegie US University Professor of the Year, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2003) Nobel Prize in Physics 2001, Nobel Foundation (2001) Ph.D., Stanford University, Physics  (1977) B.S., MIT, Physics  (1973) cwieman@stanford.edu Department:&nbspGraduate School of Education Curriculum Vitae DOC Research Interests Brain and Learning Sciences Higher Education Science Education Teachers and Teaching Current Research and Scholarly Interests The Wieman group\u2019s research generally focuses on the nature of expertise in science and engineering, particularly physics, and how that expertise is best learned, measured, and taught.  This involves a range of approaches, including individual cognitive interviews, laboratory experiments, and classroom interventions with controls for comparisons.  We are also looking at how different classroom practices impact the attitudes and learning of different demographic groups. Some current projects include: 1. Investigating problem solving strategies. We are examining the detailed components in problem solving to determine how these combine to achieve problem solving success, and how the strengths and weaknesses of a learners strategy can be measured and then improved.  This work involves physics based computer simulations where students decide what information to seek, how to interpret the information they get, and then how they choose to act on that information.   The goals of this research are, primarily, to identify which aspects of problem solving strategies pave the way to expertise and how to teach these effectively. 2. Cognitive principles for instructional design Although current \u201cactive learning\u201d efforts have been shown to provide better learning outcomes than traditional instructional methods, there is currently little guidance on how to design such materials to best support learning.  We are designing, implementing, and studying instructional materials that take into account findings on human cognition, such as the benefits of inventing from a series of contrasting cases (e.g. Schwartz et al., 2011).  By studying the efficacy of these materials, we hope to provide instructors, curriculum developers, and researchers with new principles for designing effective instructional materials for typical classroom instruction.  A particular focus at this time is the use and learning of mechanistic reasoning, a fundamental component of physic expertise, as well as many other sciences. 3. The assessment and learning of adaptive medical expertise.  Although medical education focuses heavily on mastery factual information and procedures under carefully identified conditions, medical practice takes place in a much less controlled environment.  There are many other possibly relevant and irrelevant factors a doctor must take into account.  This calls for adaptive expertise, the capability to operate in new contexts and learn new things as needed.  We are working on the better assessment of such adaptive expertise and ultimately on the improvement of medical teaching to better teach it.

Harvard University Press. Enhancing Diversity in Undergraduate Science: Self-Efficacy Drives Performance Gains with Active Learning. CBE life sciences education Ballen, C. J., Wieman, C., Salehi, S., Searle, J. B., Zamudio, K. R. 16 (4) Efforts to retain underrepresented minority (URM) students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have shown only limited success in higher education, due in part to a persistent achievement gap between students from historically underrepresented and well-represented backgrounds. To test the hypothesis that active learning disproportionately benefits URM students, we quantified the effects of traditional versus active learning on student academic performance, science self-efficacy, and sense of social belonging in a large (more than 250 students) introductory STEM course. A transition to active learning closed the gap in learning gains between non-URM and URM students and led to an increase in science self-efficacy for all students. Sense of social belonging also increased significantly with active learning, but only for non-URM students. Through structural equation modeling, we demonstrate that, for URM students, the increase in self-efficacy mediated the positive effect of active-learning pedagogy on two metrics of student performance. Our results add to a growing body of research that supports varied and inclusive teaching as one pathway to a diversified STEM workforce.

G., Wieman, C. E., Bonn, D. A. 112 (36) : 11199-11204 The ability to make decisions based on data, with its inherent uncertainties and variability, is a complex and vital skill in the modern world. The need for such quantitative critical thinking occurs in many different contexts, and although it is an important goal of education, that goal is seldom being achieved. We argue that the key element for developing this ability is repeated practice in making decisions based on data, with feedback on those decisions. We demonstrate a structure for providing suitable practice that can be applied in any instructional setting that involves the acquisition of data and relating that data to scientific models. This study reports the results of applying that structure in an introductory physics laboratory course. Students in an experimental condition were repeatedly instructed to make and act on quantitative comparisons between datasets, and between data and models, an approach that is common to all science disciplines. These instructions were slowly faded across the course. After the instructions had been removed, students in the experimental condition were 12 times more likely to spontaneously propose or make changes to improve their experimental methods than a control group, who performed traditional experimental activities. The students in the experimental condition were also four times more likely to identify and explain a limitation of a physical model using their data. Students in the experimental condition also showed much more sophisticated reasoning about their data. These differences between the groups were seen to persist into a subsequent course taken the following year.

CBE life sciences education Wieman, C., Gilbert, S. 13 (3) : 552-569 We have created an inventory to characterize the teaching practices used in science and mathematics courses. This inventory can aid instructors and departments in reflecting on their teaching. It has been tested with several hundred university instructors and courses from mathematics and four science disciplines. Most instructors complete the inventory in 10 min or less, and the results allow meaningful comparisons of the teaching used for the different courses and instructors within a department and across different departments. We also show how the inventory results can be used to gauge the extent of use of research-based teaching practices, and we illustrate this with the inventory results for five departments. These results show the high degree of discrimination provided by the inventory, as well as its effectiveness in tracking the increase in the use of research-based teaching practices.

PloS one Burkholder, E., Blackmon, L., Wieman, C. 2020 15 (12) : e0244146 In a previous study, we found that students' incoming preparation in physics-crudely measured by concept inventory prescores and math SAT or ACT scores-explains 34% of the variation in Physics 1 final exam scores at Stanford University. In this study, we sought to understand the large variation in exam scores not explained by these measures of incoming preparation. Why are some students' successful in physics 1 independent of their preparation? To answer this question, we interviewed 34 students with particularly low concept inventory prescores and math SAT\/ACT scores about their experiences in the course. We unexpectedly found a set of common practices and attitudes. We found that students' use of instructional resources had relatively little impact on course performance, while student characteristics, student attitudes, and students' interactions outside the classroom all had a more substantial impact on course performance. These results offer some guidance as to how instructors might help all students succeed in introductory physics courses. DOI 10.1371\/journal.pone.0244146 PubMedID 33332432 Exploring bias in mechanical engineering students' perceptions of classmates. PloS one Salehi, S., Holmes, N. G., Wieman, C. 2019 14 (3) : e0212477 Gender disparity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is an on-going challenge. Gender bias is one of the possible mechanisms leading to such disparities and has been extensively studied. Previous work showed that there was a gender bias in how students perceived the competence of their peers in undergraduate biology courses. We examined whether there was a similar gender bias in a mechanical engineering course. We conducted the study in two offerings of the course, which used different instructional practices. We found no gender bias in peer perceptions of competence in either of the offerings. However, we did see that the offerings' different instructional practices affected aspects of classroom climate, including: the number of peers who were perceived to be particularly knowledgeable, the richness of the associated network of connections between students, students' familiarity with each other, and their perceptions about the course environment. These results suggest that negative bias against female students in peer perception is not universal, either across institutions or across STEM fields, and that instructional methods may have an impact on classroom climate.

Because simulations are used by such a wide range of students, we are researching what and how students of different ages and scientific backgrounds learn from them. How effective are PhET simulations at motivating and engaging such a wide range of students in science? We aim to determine which aspects of the simulations best support learning across a range of student ages and backgrounds, and what sorts of supporting materials or instruction are most effective for those different students. In addition, we are looking into what learning\u00a0outcomes PhET simulations facilitate, from learning specific science concepts, to exploring the underlying mechanisms of the phenomenon, to developing inquiry or metacognitive skills. Identifying student inquiry skills We are examining the interplay between content knowledge and problem solving strategies, and how this relation is mediated by technology and socioemotional factors. Problem solving strategies are too often studied separately from social and emotional contexts and are evaluated too universally regardless of the accompanying content knowledge.\u00a0 The goals of\u00a0this research are,\u00a0primarily, to identify which problem solving strategies pave the\u00a0way to expertise and which strategies paralyze the experts; and, secondarily, how socioemotional factors and technology use can positively or negatively contribute to these processes. Cognitive principles for instructional design Although current \u201cactive learning\u201d efforts have been shown to provide better learning outcomes than traditional instructional methods, there is currently little guidance on how to design such materials to best support learning. \u00a0We are designing, implementing, and studying instructional materials that take into account findings on human cognition, such as the benefits of inventing from a series of contrasting cases (e.g. Schwartz et al., 2011). \u00a0By studying the efficacy of these materials, we hope to provide instructors, curriculum developers, and researchers with new principles for designing effective instructional materials for typical classroom instruction. STEM Expertise--measuring, teaching, and learning We look at the characteristics that distinguish expert thinking across multiple science and engineering and medical disciplines.\u00a0 We are developing better ways to measure the degree to which students at various levels have developed these thinking skills, and in laboratory and classroom environments we test various ways to improve the acquisition of these skills. This work is heavily guided by research in cognitive psychology.  Carl Wieman cwieman@stanford.edu"
