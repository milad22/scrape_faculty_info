                "Gaseous and stellar metallicities in galaxies are nowadays routinely used to constrain the evolutionary processes in galaxies. This requires the knowledge of the average yield per stellar generation, yZ, i.e. the quantity of metals that a stellar population releases into the interstellar medium (ISM), which is generally assumed to be a fixed fiducial value. Deviations of the observed metallicity from the expected value of yZ are used to quantify the effect of outflows or inflows of gas, or even as evidence for biased metallicity calibrations or inaccurate metallicity diagnostics. Here, we show that  depends significantly on the initial mass function (IMF), varying by up to a factor larger than three, for the range of IMFs typically adopted in various studies. Varying the upper mass cutoff of the IMF implies a further variation of yZ by an additional factor that can be larger than two. These effects, along with the variation of the gas \u2026",
                "We present chemical evolution models aimed at reproducing the observed (N\/O) versus (O\/H) abundance pattern of star-forming galaxies in the Local Universe. We derive gas-phase abundances from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy and a complementary sample of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, making use of a consistent set of abundance calibrations. This collection of data clearly confirms the existence of a plateau in the (N\/O) ratio at very low metallicity, followed by an increase of this ratio up to high values as the metallicity increases. This trend can be interpreted as due to two main sources of nitrogen in galaxies: (i) massive stars, which produce small amounts of pure primary nitrogen and are responsible for the (N\/O) ratio in the low-metallicity plateau; (ii) low- and intermediate-mass stars, which produce both secondary and primary nitrogen and enrich the interstellar medium with a time \u2026",
                "We present the first chemical evolution model for Enceladus, alias the Gaia Sausage, to investigate the star formation history of one of the most massive satellites accreted by the Milky Way during a major merger event. Our best chemical evolution model for Enceladus nicely fits the observed stellar [\u03b1\/Fe]\u2013[Fe\/H] chemical abundance trends, and reproduces the observed stellar metallicity distribution function, by assuming low star formation efficiency, fast infall time-scale, and mild outflow intensity. We predict a median age for Enceladus stars  Gyr, and \u2013 at the time of the merger with our Galaxy (\u224810 Gyr ago from Helmi et al.) \u2013 we predict for Enceladus a total stellar mass M\u22c6 \u2248 5 \u00d7 109\u2009M. By looking at the predictions of our best model, we discuss that merger events between the Galaxy and systems like Enceladus may have inhibited the gas accretion on to the Galaxy disc at high redshifts, heating \u2026",
                "We present updated chemical evolution models of two dwarf spheroidal galaxies (Sculptor and Carina) and the first detailed chemical evolution models of two ultra-faint dwarfs (Hercules and Bo\u00f6tes I). Our results suggest that the dwarf spheroidals evolve with a low efficiency of star formation, confirming previous results, and the ultra-faint dwarfs with an even lower one. Under these assumptions, we can reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, the [\u03b1\/Fe] versus [Fe\/H] abundance patterns and the total stellar and gas masses observed at the present time in these objects. In particular, for the ultra-faint dwarfs we assume a strong initial burst of star formation, with the mass of the system being already in place at early times. On the other hand, for the classical dwarf spheroidals the agreement with the data is found by assuming the star formation histories suggested by the colour\u2013magnitude diagrams and \u2026",
                "We model gas-phase metallicity radial profiles of galaxies in the local Universe by building on the \u2018bathtub\u2019 chemical evolution formalism \u2013 where a galaxy\u2019s gas content is determined by the interplay between inflow, star formation, and outflows. In particular, we take into account inside-out disc growth and add physically motivated prescriptions for radial gradients in star formation efficiency (SFE). We fit analytical models against the metallicity radial profiles of low-redshift star-forming galaxies in the mass range log\u2009(M\u22c6\/M\u2299)  = [9.0\u201311.0] derived by Belfiore et al., using data from the MaNGA survey. The models provide excellent fits to the data and are capable of reproducing the change in shape of the radial metallicity profiles, including the flattening observed in the centres of massive galaxies. We derive the posterior probability distribution functions for the model parameters and find significant degeneracies \u2026",
                "We study the redshift evolution of the gas-phase O\/H and N\/O abundances, both (i) for individual interstellar medium (ISM) regions within single spatially resolved galaxies and (ii) when dealing with average abundances in the whole ISM of many unresolved galaxies. We make use of a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation including detailed chemical enrichment, which properly takes into account the variety of different stellar nucleosynthetic sources of O and N in galaxies. We identify 33 galaxies in the simulation, lying within dark matter haloes with virial mass in the range 1011 \u2264 MDM \u2264 1013 M\u2299 and reconstruct how they evolved with redshift. For the local and global measurements, the observed increasing trend of N\/O at high O\/H can be explained, respectively, (i) as the consequence of metallicity gradients that have settled in the galaxy ISM, where the innermost galactic regions have the highest O\/H \u2026",
                "We describe the use of our chemical evolution model to reproduce the abundance patterns observed in a catalogue of elliptical galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. The model assumes ellipticals form by fast gas accretion, and suffer a strong burst of star formation followed by a galactic wind, which quenches star formation. Models with fixed initial mass function (IMF) failed in simultaneously reproducing the observed trends with the galactic mass. So, we tested a varying IMF; contrary to the diffused claim that the IMF should become bottom heavier in more massive galaxies, we find a better agreement with data by assuming an inverse trend, where the IMF goes from being bottom heavy in less massive galaxies to top heavy in more massive ones. This naturally produces a downsizing in star formation, favouring massive stars in largest galaxies. Finally, we tested the use of the integrated \u2026",

                "We have studied the effects of various initial mass functions (IMFs) on the chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). In particular, we tested the effects of the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) on various predicted abundance patterns. The IGIMF depends on the star formation rate and metallicity and predicts less massive stars in a regime of low star formation, as it is the case in dwarf spheroidals. We adopted a detailed chemical evolution model following the evolution of \u03b1-elements, Fe and Eu, and assuming the currently best set of stellar yields. We also explored different yield prescriptions for the Eu, including production from neutron star mergers. Although the uncertainties still present in the stellar yields and data prevent us from drawing firm conclusions, our results suggest that the IGIMF applied to Sgr predicts lower [\u03b1\/Fe] ratios than classical IMFs and lower [hydrostatic\/explosive \u2026",
                "Over the course of its history, the Milky Way has ingested multiple smaller satellite galaxies 1. Although these accreted stellar populations can be forensically identified as kinematically distinct structures within the Galaxy, it is difficult in general to date precisely the age at which any one merger occurred. Recent results have revealed a population of stars that were accreted via the collision of a dwarf galaxy, called Gaia\u2013Enceladus 1, leading to substantial pollution of the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky Way. Here we identify the very bright, naked-eye star \u03bd Indi as an indicator of the age of the early in situ population of the Galaxy. We combine asteroseismic, spectroscopic, astrometric and kinematic observations to show that this metal-poor, alpha-element-rich star was an indigenous member of the halo, and we measure its age to be(stat)(sys) billion years. The star bears hallmarks \u2026"
