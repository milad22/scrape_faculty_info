Parno Assistant Professor Affiliate Assistant Professor, University of Washington Nuclear & Particle Physics Neutrino Physics Wean Hall 8018 Lab Website Ph.D.: Carnegie Mellon University (2011) Professional Societies: American Physical Society Curriculum ViTAE Assistant Research Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 2017\u2013 Research Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Washington, 2016 Associate Director, CENPA, University of Washington, 2014\u20132016 Acting Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Washington, 2014\u20132016 Post-doctoral research: University of Washington, 2011\u20132014 My primary research interest is in the physics of the neutrino, a fundamental particle that is generated in particle decays and nuclear reactions and that, in the Standard Model of particle physics, interacts only via the weak force. At Earth's distance from the Sun, about 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter every second, and the vast majority of them pass right through the planet. Neutrinos interact with matter so rarely that they were originally assumed to be massless, but in the last two decades several clever experiments showed that neutrinos do have a small but nonzero mass. Furthermore, despite its small magnitude, the mass of the neutrino has made an imprint on a cosmic scale: vast numbers of neutrinos were created in the early universe, and their collective mass affected the way that early structures formed. Neutrinos provided the first evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector, and they provide a bridge between very small scales and very large ones. The neutrino mass scale offers a rare opportunity to probe a cosmological parameter in the laboratory. I am Analysis Co-Coordinator for the KATRIN experiment in Karlsruhe, Germany, which is designed to improve on existing direct neutrino-mass limits by an order of magnitude. KATRIN will use the kinematics of tritium beta decay to extract the neutrino-mass scale with an anticipated sensitivity of 0.2 eV\/c^2 (90% confidence level) \u2014 a value more than 2.5 million times lighter than the electron mass! KATRIN is currently preparing for the beginning of data-taking with tritium toward the end of 2017. My group is involved with maintenance, operation and characterization of the main KATRIN detector system; data-quality assurance for the entire experiment; and background studies. We are also working to understand the molecular physics of gaseous tritium sources more generally, both with anticipated KATRIN data and with a dedicated experiment in Seattle, the Tritium Recoil-Ion Mass Spectrometer (TRIMS).
