                "This paper presents a rock mechanics design methodology applicable to steeply dipping orebodies typical of many underground hardrock mines. The first stage in the design process is the characterization of the rock mass using bothin situ and laboratory data. The effects of anisotropy on rock mass behaviour are discussed with reference to laboratory and field observations. The second stage involves the use of a number of selected numerical modelling techniques to investigate ground response in the near-field rock mass surrounding the mining excavations. This study shows that the use of several numerical methods in conjunction, allowing for the advantages of each method to be maximized, provides a more comprehensive analysis of the different facets of stope design. This approach differs from those in the literature which seek to compare the different numerical methods in order to select just one \u2026"
