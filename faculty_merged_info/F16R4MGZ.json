                "Shinsei  Ryu Shinsei  Ryu Professor of Physics Fax: 609-258-6360 shinseir@princeton.edu Kimberly  Dawidowski Background Professor Ryu received a BS in physics and an MS and PhD in applied physics, all from the University of Tokyo. He completed two postdoctoral appointments, the first at the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the second at the University of California, Berkeley. \u00a0Professor Ryu was an associate professor of condensed matter physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before joining the faculty at Princeton University. I am broadly interested in theoretical condensed matter physics, in particular, quantum mechanical aspects of condensed matter systems. My past research highlights coherence, entanglement, and topology---unique features in quantum systems. To this end, I have investigated the quantum Hall effect, unconventional superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, and topological superconductors."
