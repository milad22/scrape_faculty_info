                "On the eve of the twenty-first century, two new hit shows featuring the Victorian author John Ruskin as a major character played to enthusiastic audiences in New York and San Francisco. It was the year 2000, centenary of the nineteenth-century British writer\u2019s death. But a fever for anniversary trivia alone could not have triggered Ruskin\u2019s sudden theatrical eminence. One of these plays, Greg Murphy\u2019s The Countess, had opened off Broadway in 1999 to become the longest-running new production of that season.
