                "Duncan Weathers, Ph.D Duncan Weathers, Ph.D Associate Professor (940) 565-2079 weathers@unt.edu Physics 003 Ph.D (California Institute of Technology, 1989) Research interest: Applied Physics. Ion-solid interactions, with an emphasis on sputtering, accelerator-based materials characterization techniques, ion optics, resonance ionization spectroscopy, and instrumentation. Dr. Duncan Weathers investigates experimentally the widely-applied process of sputtering, which might be described as \"atomic sand blasting\" in which atoms are removed from a surface by the impact of energetic atoms or ions. He uses the technique of Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy for his sputtering analysis."
