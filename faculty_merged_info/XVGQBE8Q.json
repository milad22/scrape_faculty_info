                "In a recent FORUM article, Dunning et al.(1992) put forward a framework of landscape processes that stimulated considerable discussion amongst us. We are in general agreement with their ideas, but feel that a more explicit recognition of the importance of movement as a component of landscape structure would add clarity and utility to the framework. We wish to build on their foundation by presenting some additional ideas. Dunning et al.(1992) outline four ecological processes acting at the landscape scale: 1) landscape complementation; 2) landscape supplementation; 3) sources and sinks; and 4) neighbourhood effects. Each process depends upon the distribution of resources in the landscape. Resources are distributed in patches. Implicit in the definition of each process is that animals move among the resource patches. In the first two, animals move among resource patches to: 1) acquire a full complement of \u2026",
                "We studied the effect of traffic intensity on local abundance of anurans. We counted dead and live frogs and toads per km and estimated frog and toad local abundances using breeding chorus intensities on similar roads through similar habitats, but with different levels of traffic intensity. After correcting for effects of date, local habitat, time, and region, our analyses demonstrated that (1) the number of dead and live frogs and toads per km decreased with increasing traffic intensity; (2) the proportion of frogs and toads dead increased with increasing traffic intensity; and (3) the frog and toad density, as measured by the chorus intensity, decreased with increasing traffic intensity. Taken together, our results indicate that traffic mortality has a significant negative effect on the local density of anurans. Our results suggest that recent increases in traffic volumes worldwide are probably contributing to declines in amphibian \u2026",
                "There is now a solid body of theoretical work 1\u20134 demonstrating that the spatial structure of the habitat combined with animal movement strongly influence host\u2013parasitoid dynamics. The spatial pattern over which parasitoid search takes place can be affected by the distribution of the hosts 5, by the spatial arrangement of the host's habitat 6 and by the spatial scale at which the parasitoid perceives variation in host abundance 7, 8. Empirical work, however, has been largely restricted to small-scale field studies of less than one hectare 6, 9 with very few larger 10, 11. Here we report initial results of a many-year, large-scale study that is among the first to examine the interaction between a population-level process (parasitism) and anthropogenic forest fragmentation at large and at multiple spatial scales. We demonstrate that parasitism by four species of parasitoids attacking the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma \u2026",

                "North American birds that feed on aerial insects are experiencing widespread population declines. An analysis of the North American Breeding Bird Survey trend estimates for 1966 to 2006 suggests that declines in this guild are significantly stronger than in passerines in general. The pattern of decline also shows a striking geographical gradient, with aerial insectivore declines becoming more prevalent towards the northeast of North America. Declines are also more acute in species that migrate long distances compared to those that migrate short distances. The declines become manifest, almost without exception, in the mid 1980s. The taxonomic breadth of these downward trends suggests that declines in aerial insectivore populations are linked to changes in populations of flying insects, and these changes might be indicative of underlying ecosystem changes.R\u00c9SUM\u00c9Les populations d\u2019oiseaux nord-am\u00e9ricains qui se nourrissent d\u2019insectes a\u00e9riens montrent un d\u00e9clin \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle.

                "We experimentally assess the relative movement abilities of two sympatric, ecologically similar species of damselfly, Calopteryx maculata and Calopteryx aequabilis (Odonata: Calopterygidae), within two structurally dissimilar habitat types, forest and pasture. For both species, streams are required resources, forest is a potential resource, and pasture is neutral habitat. Experimental manipulations were conducted at a spatial scale approaching typical inter-stream distances within our study region. A portion of the individuals was displaced away from its required stream habitat within its native landscape, and the remaining individuals were transferred to another landscape of alternate habitat structure (either forest or pasture). Within each habitat type we equate relative movement ability, an essential component of landscape connectivity, with the proportion of displaced individuals observed to have reached the stream \u2026",
                "The degree to which spatial patterns influence the dynamics and distribution of populations is a central question in ecology. This question is even more pressing in the context of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation, which threaten global biodiversity. However, the relative influence of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation, the spatial patterning of remaining habitat, remains unclear. If landscape pattern affects population size, managers may be able to design landscapes that mitigate habitat loss. We present the results of a mensurative experiment designed to test four habitat loss vs. fragmentation hypotheses. Unlike previous studies, we measured landscape structure using quantitative, spatially explicit habitat distribution models previously developed for two species: Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). We used a stratified sampling design that reduced the confounding \u2026",
                "We describe a new collaborative network, the Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus; https:\/\/motus. org), which is an international network of researchers using coordinated automated radio-telemetry arrays to study movements of small flying organisms including birds, bats, and insects, at local, regional, and hemispheric scales. Radio-telemetry has been a cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision. Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository. Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously, Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000 individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during \u2026",
                "We demonstrate that, after correcting for the effects of size, the wing lengths, wing widths and thoracic weights of the forest damselfly Calopteryx maculata differ between populations along forested streams, and those along streams through pasture. Pasture landscapes can be considered as fragmented forest landscapes; forest landscapes are continuous. In the fragmented landscapes some C. maculata fly across intervening pasture to reach foraging sites in forest. We propose that there is morphological plasticity within the species that is revealed through the landscape process of habitat fragmentation and that there is micro-scale selection within the fragmented landscapes for individuals that are better suited to make these flights.",
                "Many species of birds and bats undertake seasonal migrations between breeding and over-wintering sites. En-route, migrants alternate periods of flight with time spent at stopover \u2013 the time and space where individuals rest and refuel for subsequent flights. We assessed the spatial scale of movements made by migrants during stopover by using an array of automated telemetry receivers with multiple antennae to track the daily location of individuals over a geographic area \u223c20\u00d740 km. We tracked the movements of 322 individuals of seven migratory vertebrate species (5 passerines, 1 owl and 1 bat) during spring and fall migratory stopover on and adjacent to a large lake peninsula. Our results show that many individuals leaving their capture site relocate within the same landscape at some point during stopover, moving as much as 30 km distant from their site of initial capture. We show that many apparent nocturnal departures from stopover sites are not a resumption of migration in the strictest sense, but are instead relocations that represent continued stopover at a broader spatial scale."
