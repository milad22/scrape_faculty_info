                "Cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids have been the cornerstone of remission-induction therapy for severe antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2212associated vasculitis for 40 years. Uncontrolled studies suggest that rituximab is effective and may be safer than a cyclophosphamide-based regimen.We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial of rituximab (375 mg per square meter of body-surface area per week for 4 weeks) as compared with cyclophosphamide (2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for remission induction. Glucocorticoids were tapered off; the primary end point was remission of disease without the use of prednisone at 6 months.Nine centers enrolled 197 ANCA-positive patients with either Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis. Baseline disease activity, organ involvement, and the proportion \u2026",
                "The 18-month efficacy of a single course of rituximab as compared with conventional immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine in patients with severe (organ-threatening) antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis is unknown.In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial, we compared rituximab (375 mg per square meter of body-surface area administered once a week for 4 weeks) followed by placebo with cyclophosphamide administered for 3 to 6 months followed by azathioprine for 12 to 15 months. The primary outcome measure was complete remission of disease by 6 months, with the remission maintained through 18 months.A total of 197 patients were enrolled. As reported previously, 64% of the patients in the rituximab group, as compared with 53% of the patients in the cyclophosphamide \u2026",
                "Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome are small- to medium-vessel vasculitides linked by overlapping pathology and the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Commonly referred to as the ANCA-associated vasculitides, these diseases are challenging to diagnose and to treat. Distinguishing the ANCA-associated vasculitides from other forms of vasculitis or nonvasculitic processes (such as infection) can be particularly difficult. This review describes the clinical and pathologic hallmarks of the ANCA-associated vasculitides, discusses the role of ANCA assays in diagnosis and treatment, and outlines an approach to the evaluation and management of these diseases.",
                "To analyze damage occurring in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) enrolled in the WG Etanercept Trial (WGET) and to correlate that damage with disease activity, adverse events, and quality of life.The Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) was applied to all 180 patients at trial entry and every 6 months throughout the trial. Items of damage were analyzed by presumed etiology (i.e., secondary to WG, to therapy, or both) and time of occurrence. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between VDI scores and the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for WG (BVAS\/WG), frequency of flares, number of adverse events, and the patients' quality\u2010of\u2010life assessments.The mean VDI score was 1.3 at the study enrollment and 1.8 at the end of the trial. This increase was due to damage that occurred despite (or because of) therapy, including visual impairment, hearing loss \u2026",
                "To compare patterns of arteriographic lesions of the aorta and primary branches in patients with Takayasu9s arteritis (TAK) and giant cell arteritis (GCA).Patients were selected from two North American cohorts of TAK and GCA. The frequency of arteriographic lesions was calculated for 15 large arteries. Cluster analysis was used to derive patterns of arterial disease in TAK versus GCA and in patients categorised by age at disease onset. Using latent class analysis, computer derived classification models based upon patterns of arterial disease were compared with traditional classification.Arteriographic lesions were identified in 145 patients with TAK and 62 patients with GCA. Cluster analysis demonstrated that arterial involvement was contiguous in the aorta and usually symmetric in paired branch vessels for TAK and GCA. There was significantly more left carotid (p=0.03) and \u2026",
                "To compare the efficacy of abatacept to that of placebo for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).In this multicenter trial, patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA were treated with abatacept 10 mg\/kg intravenously on days 1, 15, and 29 and week 8, together with prednisone administered daily. At week 12, patients in remission underwent a double\u2010blinded randomization to continue to receive abatacept monthly or switch to placebo. Patients in both study arms received a standardized prednisone taper, with discontinuation of prednisone at week 28. All patients remained on their randomized assignment until meeting criteria for early termination or until 12 months after enrollment of the last patient. The primary end point was duration of remission (relapse\u2010free survival rate).Forty\u2010nine eligible patients with GCA were enrolled and treated with prednisone and abatacept; of these \u2026",
                "To create a prognostic tool to quantify the 5\u2010year cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with newly diagnosed Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) without premorbid CV disease.We reviewed CV outcomes during the long\u2010term followup of patients in the first 4 European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) trials of WG and MPA. CV events were defined as CV death, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention. Logistic regression was performed to create a model to predict the absolute risk of a CV event. The model was tested using the Wegener's Granulomatosis Etanercept Trial (WGET) cohort.Seventy\u2010four (13.8%) of 535 patients with 5 years of followup from the EUVAS trials had at least 1 CV event: 33 (11.7%) of 281 WG versus 41 (16.1%) of 254 MPA. The independent determinants of CV outcomes \u2026",
                "The systemic vasculitides are multisystem disorders with considerable mortality and morbidity and frequent relapses. In the absence of reliable serological markers, accurate clinical tools are required to assess disease activity and damage for treatment decisions, and for the performance of clinical trials. This article reviews and summarises the development and use of disease assessment tools for determining activity and damage in systemic vasculitis and reports ongoing initiatives for further development of disease assessment tools. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and reference lists for vasculitis, assessment, clinical trials, outcome and prognosis. The findings indicate that comprehensive disease assessment in vasculitis requires documentation of disease activity, chronic irreversible damage and impairment of function.",
                "Takayasu arteritis is a rare inflammatory disease of large arteries. The etiology of Takayasu arteritis remains poorly understood, but genetic contribution to the disease pathogenesis is supported by the genetic association with HLA-B\u221752. We genotyped \u223c200,000 genetic variants in two ethnically divergent Takayasu arteritis cohorts from Turkey and North America by using a custom-designed genotyping platform (Immunochip). Additional genetic variants and the classical HLA alleles were imputed and analyzed. We identified and confirmed two independent susceptibility loci within the HLA region (r2 < 0.2): HLA-B\/MICA (rs12524487, OR = 3.29, p = 5.57 \u00d7 10\u221216) and HLA-DQB1\/HLA-DRB1 (rs113452171, OR = 2.34, p = 3.74 \u00d7 10\u22129; and rs189754752, OR = 2.47, p = 4.22 \u00d7 10\u22129). In addition, we identified and confirmed a genetic association between Takayasu arteritis and the FCGR2A\/FCGR3A locus on \u2026",
                "To evaluate whether the classification of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) according to ANCA type (anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) or anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies) predicts treatment response.Treatment responses were assessed among patients enrolled in the Rituximab in ANCA-associated Vasculitis trial according to both AAV diagnosis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)\/microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)) and ANCA type (PR3-AAV\/MPO-AAV). Complete remission (CR) was defined as disease activity score of 0 and successful completion of the prednisone taper.PR3-AAV patients treated with rituximab (RTX) achieved CR at 6\u2005months more frequently than did those randomised to cyclophosphamide (CYC)\/azathioprine (AZA) (65% vs 48%; p=0.04).
