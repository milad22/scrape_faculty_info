University of Cincinnati 2012 PhD candidate Physics Education (est. graduation 2019) Joined Miami faculty 2019 I usually teach the introductory algebra-based physics courses for allied health professionals. My teaching strategy is an interactive approach which builds student confidences and abilities by using real-world scenarios related to students disciplines. This helps students be less afraid of physics and understand that we use it every day. My research focus is in Physics Education, with an interest in statistical and scientific reasoning."
