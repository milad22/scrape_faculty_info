                "We describe the growth of hexagonal GaN on Si(111) by gas source molecular beam epitaxy with ammonia. The initial deposition of Al, at 1130\u20131190 K, resulted in a very rapid transition to a two-dimensional growth mode of AlN. The rapid transition is essential for the subsequent growth of high quality GaN and AlGaN. This procedure also resulted in complete elimination of cracking in thick (>2 \u03bcm) GaN layers. For layers thicker than 1.5 \u03bcm, the full width at half maximum of the (0002) GaN diffraction peak was less than 14 arc sec. We show that a short period superlattice of AlGaN\/GaN grown on the AlN buffer can be used to block defects propagating through GaN, resulting in good crystal and luminescence quality. At room temperature, the linewidth of the GaN exciton recombination peak was less than 40 meV, typical of the best samples grown on sapphire.",
                "We study the vibrational spectrum of AlN grown on Si (111). The AlN was deposited using gas-source molecular beam epitaxy. Raman backscattering along the growth c axis and from a cleaved surface perpendicular to the wurtzite c direction allows us to determine the E 2 1, E 2 2, A 1 (TO), A 1 (LO), and E 1 (TO) phonon energies. For a 0.8-\u03bcm-thick AlN layer under a biaxial tensile stress of 0.6 GPa, these are 249.0, 653.6, 607.3, 884.5, and 666.5 cm\u2212 1, respectively. By combining the Raman and x-ray diffraction studies, the Raman stress factor of AlN is found to be\u2212 6.3\u00b11.4 cm\u2212 1\/GPa for the E 2 2 phonon. This factor depends on published values of the elastic constants of AlN, as discussed in the text. The zero-stress E 2 2 energy is determined to be 657.4\u00b10.2 cm\u2212 1. Fourier-transform infrared reflectance and absorption techniques allow us to measure the E 1 (TO) and A 1 (LO) phonon energies. The film \u2026",
                "The structure, metal-insulator transition (MIT), and related Terahertz (THz) transmission characteristics of VO2 thin films obtained by sputtering deposition on c-, r-, and m-plane sapphire substrates were investigated by different techniques. On c-sapphire, monoclinic VO2 films were characterized to be epitaxial films with triple domain structure caused by \u03b2-angle mismatch. Monoclinic VO2 \u03b2 angle of 122.2\u00b0 and the two angles of V4+\u2013V4+ chain deviating from the am axis of 4.4\u00b0 and 4.3\u00b0 are determined. On r-sapphire, tetragonal VO2 was determined to be epitaxially deposited with VO2 (011)T perpendicular to the growth direction, while the structural phase transformation into lower symmetric monoclinic phase results in (2\u00af11) and (200) orientations forming a twinned structure. VO2 on m-sapphire has several growth orientations, related with the uneven substrate surface and possible inter-diffusion between film and \u2026",
                "Large signal-to-background (S\/B) ratios for the Fe(CN)63-\/4- and IrCl62-\/3- redox couples in KCl have been observed in cyclic voltammetric measurements made at a conductive diamond thin-film electrode without any conventional surface pretreatment. The S\/B ratios were a factor of \u223c16 and 8 larger at diamond than at freshly polished glassy carbon (GC) for Fe(CN)63-\/4- and IrCl62-\/3-, respectively. The polycrystalline diamond film, grown on a p-Si(100) substrate, possessed significant cubic {100} faceting, as evidenced by AFM images, and was of high quality, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy. The high degree of electrochemical activity without surface pretreatment, the enhanced S\/B ratios, and the excellent response stability demonstrate that diamond might be an attractive new electrode material for electroanalysis.

                "The Boltzmann transport equation is used to calculate thermal and electrical conductivity of metal nanostructures with characteristic dimensions in the 25\u2013500 nm range, near to and above the Debye temperature. Thermal conductivity contributions from phonons and electrons are considered. The intrinsic effects of electron-phonon, phonon-phonon, and phonon-electron scattering, and grain boundary and surface interactions are addressed. Excellent agreement is found between model results and available data reporting direct measurements of thermal conductivity of nanowires, ribbons, and thin films in Al, Pt, and Cu, respectively. The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law and Lorenz factor are examined with decreasing size; their applicability is found to degrade in nanowires due mainly to increased relative phonon contribution. The effect of differences in the electron mean-free path for thermal gradient versus electrical \u2026",
                "We report direct-backscattering Raman studies of GaAs1\u2212xNx alloys, for x\u2a7d0.03, grown on (001) GaAs. The Raman spectra exhibit a two-mode behavior. The allowed GaAs-like longitudinal-optic phonon near 292\u2009cm\u22121 is found to red shift at a rate of \u2212136\u00b110\u2009cm\u22121\/x. This is well described by the combined effects of strain and alloying. The GaN-like phonon near 470\u2009cm\u22121 is observed to increase in intensity in direct proportion to x, and to systematically blue shift at a rate of 197\u00b110\u2009cm\u22121\/x. This blue shift is likewise attributed to strain and alloying. The GaAs-like second-order features are also seen to broaden slightly and diminish in intensity with increasing nitrogen concentration. These results are attributed to a weak breakdown in the zincblende-crystal long-range order, possibly related to the presence of ordered domains within the random alloy.",
                "The fabrication and testing of Teflon AF-coated channels on silicon and bonding of the same to a similarly coated glass wafer are described. With water or aqueous solutions in such channels, the channels exhibit much better light conduction ability than similar uncoated channels. Although the loss is greater than extruded Teflon AF tubes, light throughput is far superior to channels described in the literature consisting of [110] planes in silicon with 45\u00b0 sidewalls. Absorbance noise levels under actual flow conditions using an LED source, an inexpensive photodiode and a simple operational amplifier circuitry was 1\u00d7 10\/sup -4\/ absorbance units over a 10-mm path length (channel 0.17-mm deep \u00d70.49-mm wide), comparable to many commercially available macroscale flow-through absorbance detectors.

                "We report Raman studies of the Si\u2013Si phonon band in Si1\u2212xGex alloys, where the excitation is by visible and ultraviolet (351 nm) light. At a wavelength 351 nm, the optical penetration depth is extremely shallow (\u22485 nm). By varying the excitation from 351 to 514 nm, the optical penetration depth spans from 5 to 300 nm. Two sets of samples were examined. Thin layers grown using molecular beam epitaxy were coherently strained to match the lattice constant of the silicon substrate. Thick layers grown using organo\u2013metallic chemical vapor deposition were strain relaxed. For the thin, strained layers, visible excitation produces a spectrum, which is a superposition of the substrate and the epilayer phonon bands. Reducing the wavelength (and, consequently, penetration depth) allows us to isolate the epilayer spectrum. Phonon energies obtained using all excitation wavelengths agree. We conclude that Raman \u2026",
                "We report measurements of stress in GaN epitaxial layers grown on 6H\u2013SiC and \u03b1-Al2O3 substrates. Biaxial stresses span +1.0\u2009GPa (tensile) to \u22121.2\u2009GPa (compressive). Stress determined from curvature measurements, obtained using phase-shift interferometry (PSI) microscopy, compare well with measurements using accepted techniques of x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Correlation between XRD and Raman measurements of the E22 phonon gives a Raman-stress factor of \u22123.4\u00b10.3\u2009cm\u22121\/GPa. We apply PSI microscopy for temperature dependent stress measurements of the GaN films. Variations found in the stress\u2013temperature coefficient correlate well with threading dislocation densities. We develop a phenomenological model which describes the thermal stress of the epitaxial GaN as a superposition of that for ideal GaN and the free volume existing in the layers due to the threading \u2026",
                "Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes grown on Si(111) by gas-source molecular-beam epitaxy with ammonia are described. The layers are composed of superlattices of AlGaN\/GaN and AlN\/AlGaInN. The layers are doped n and p type with Si and Mg, respectively. Hole concentration of 4\u00d71017\u2009cm\u22123, with a mobility of 8 cm2\/Vs, is measured in Al0.4Ga0.6N\/GaN. We demonstrate effective n- and p-type doping of structures based on AlN\/AlGaInN. Light-emitting diodes based on these structures show light emission between 290 and 334 nm."
