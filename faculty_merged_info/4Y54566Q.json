                "We report the excited-state intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics of four tetrahydro [5] helicene-based imide (THHBI) derivatives with various electron-donating substitutes in different polarity of solvents using steady-state, time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. It is found that, the small bathochromic-shift of the absorption spectra but large red shift of the emission spectra for all dyes with increasing solvent polarity indicates the larger dipole moment of the excited state compared to ground state. The results of theoretical calculations exhibit the charge transfer from the terminal donors to helical backbone, which accounts for the degrees of red shift of the emission spectra from different extent of ICT nature. Time-resolved TA spectra recorded as a function of electron-donating substitutes and solvent polarity show the dye with stronger donors (THHBI-PhNPh 2) in more polar solvent behaves \u2026",
                "Although numerous studies have been devoted to the charge transfer through double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), one of the major problems that hinder their potential applications in molecular electronics is the fast deprotonation of guanine cation (G+\u2022) to form a neutral radical that can cause the termination of hole transfer. It is thus of critical importance to explore other DNA structures, among which G-quadruplexes are an emerging topic. By nanosecond laser flash photolysis, we report here the direct observation and findings of the unusual deprotonation behavior (loss of amino proton N2\u2013H instead of imino proton N1\u2013H) and slower (1\u20132 orders of magnitude) deprotonation rate of G+\u2022 within G-quadruplexes, compared to the case in the free base dG or dsDNA. Four G-quadruplexes AG3(T2AG3)3, (G4T4G4)2, (TG4T)4, and G2T2G2TGTG2T2G2 (TBA) are measured systematically to examine the relationship of \u2026",
                "Construction of GdIII photosensitizers is important for designing theranostic agents owing to the unique properties arising from seven unpaired f electrons of the Gd3+ ion. Combining these with the advantages of porpholactones with tunable NIR absorption, we herein report the synthesis of GdIII complexes Gd-1\u20134 (1, porphyrin; 2, porpholactone; 3 and 4, cis-and trans-porphodilactone, respectively) and investigated their function as singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitizers. These Gd complexes displayed 1O2 quantum yields (F\u0394s) from 0.64\u20130.99 with the order Gd-1< Gd-2< Gd-3< Gd-4. The gradually enhanced 1O2 sensitization after \u03b2-oxazolone moiety replacement was ascribed to the narrowing of the energy gap (\u0394E) between the lowest triplet states (T1) of the ligand and the energy level of the 1\u0394g! 3\u03a3g transition of 1O2. In particular, Gd-4 is capable of excitation in the visible to NIR region (400\u2013700 nm) with a quantum yield near unity. These Gd complexes were first demonstrated as efficient photosensitizers in photocatalysis such as oxidative C\u00c0H bond functionalization of secondary or tertiary amines, and the oxygenation of the natural product cholesterol. Finally, after glycosylation, these water-soluble Gd complexes showed potential applications in photodynamic therapy (PDT) in HeLa cells. This work revealed that GdIII complexes of \u201cbioinspired\u201d \u03b2-modified porpholactones are efficient NIR photosensitizers and form a chemical basis to construct appealing photocatalysts and theranostic agents based on lanthanides.",
                "Although the radical ion pair has been frequently invoked as a key intermediate in DNA oxidative damage reactions and photoinduced electron transfer processes, the unambiguous detection and characterization of this species remain formidable and unresolved due to its extremely unstable nature and low concentration. We use the strategy that, at cryogenic temperatures, the transient species could be sufficiently stabilized to be detectable spectroscopically. By coupling the two techniques (the cryogenic stabilization and the time-resolved laser flash photolysis spectroscopy) together, we are able to capture the ion-pair transient G+\u2022\u22efCl\u2212 in the chlorine radical\u2013initiated DNA guanine (G) oxidation reaction, and provide direct evidence to ascertain the intricate type of addition\/charge separation mechanism underlying guanine oxidation. The unique spectral signature of the radical ion-pair G+\u2022\u22efCl\u2212 is identified \u2026",
                "Radical cations of nucleobases are key intermediates causing genome mutation, among which cytosine C\u2022+ is of growing importance because the ensuing cytosine oxidation causes GC \u2192 AT transversions in DNA replication. Although the chemistry and biology of steady-state C oxidation products have been characterized, time-resolved study of initial degradation pathways of C\u2022+ is still at the preliminary stage. Herein, we choose i-motif, a unique C-quadruplex structure composed of hemiprotonated base pairs C(H)+:C, to examine C\u2022+ degradation in a DNA surrounding without interference of G bases. Comprehensive time-resolved spectroscopy were performed to track C\u2022+ dynamics in i-motif and in free base dC. The competing pathways of deprotonation (1.4 \u00d7 107 s\u20131), tautomerization (8.8 \u00d7 104 s\u20131), and hydration (5.3 \u00d7 103 s\u20131) are differentiated, and their rate constants are determined for the first time \u2026",
                "Benzo[1,3]oxazine, an organic optical switching compound, is known to be in an equilibrium between its closed form (OX) and its open zwitterionic form (IN). Here we report a light-induced ring-closing mechanism of a hydrogen-bonded adduct (p-IN, partially protonated open isomer of benzo[1,3]oxazine) based on the observations of femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectra in protic solvents. Femtosecond transient measurements upon visible excitation reveal the appearance of two states having different dynamical signatures. One corresponds to a conventional intramolecular charge transfer excited state. The other one is a concerted electron\u2013proton transfer product (d-IN, embedded solvent molecule released from p-IN). Without steric hindrance, the main molecular structure tends to be planar upon excitation, and two intermediates, IN and OX, are involved in the sequential thermal \u2026",
                "Among all the DNA components, extremely redox-active guanine (G) and adenine (A) bases are subject to facile loss of an electron and form cation radicals (G+\u00b7 and A+\u00b7) when exposed to irradiation or radical oxidants. The subsequent deprotonation of G+\u00b7 and A+\u00b7 can invoke DNA damage or interrupt hole transfer in DNA. However, compared with intensive reports for G+\u00b7, studies on the deprotonation of A+\u00b7 are still limited at present. Herein, we investigate the deprotonation behavior of A+\u00b7 by time-resolved laser flash photolysis. The deprotonation product of A(N6-H)\u00b7 is observed and the deprotonation rate constant, (2.0\u00b10.1) \u00d7 107 s\u22121, is obtained at room temperature. Further, the deprotonation rate constants of A+\u00b7 are measured at temperatures varying from 280 K to 300 K, from which the activation energy for the N6-H deprotonation is determined to be (17.1\u00b11.0) kJ\/mol by Arrhenius equation. In addition, by \u2026",
                "Phosphorothioate (PS) modifications naturally appear in bacteria and archaea genome and are widely used as antisense strategy in gene therapy. But the chemical effects of PS introduction as a redox active site into DNA (S-DNA) is still poorly understood. Herein, we perform time-resolved spectroscopy to examine the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the PS oxidation by potent radicals in free model, in dinucleotide, and in S-oligomer. The crucial sulphur-centered hemi-bonded intermediates -P\u2013S\u2234S\u2013P- were observed and found to play critical roles leading to the stable adducts of -P\u2013S\u2013S\u2013P-, which are backbone DNA lesion products. Moreover, the oxidation of the PS moiety in dinucleotides d[GPSG], d[APSA], d[GPSA], d[APSG] and in S-oligomers was monitored in real-time, showing that PS oxidation can compete with adenine but not with guanine. Significantly, hole transfer process from A+\u2022 to PS \u2026",

                "One-electron oxidation of adenine (A) leads initially to the formation of adenine radical cation (A\u2022+). Subsequent deprotonation of A\u2022+ can provoke deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, which further causes senescence, cancer formation, and even cell death. However, compared with considerable reports on A\u2022+ reactions in free deoxyadenosine (dA) and duplex DNA, studies in non-B-form DNA that play critical biological roles are rare at present. It is thus of vital importance to explore non-B-form DNA, among which the triplex is an emerging topic. Herein, we investigate the deprotonation behavior of A\u2022+ in the TAT triplex with continuous A bases by time-resolved laser flash photolysis. The rate constants for the one-oxidation of triplex 8.4 \u00d7 108 M\u22121 s\u22121 and A\u2022+ deprotonation 1.3 \u00d7 107 s\u22121 are obtained.
