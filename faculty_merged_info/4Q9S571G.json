The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV.

                "The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid. This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers. All of these components come together under the ATLAS simulation infrastructure. In this paper, that infrastructure is discussed, including that supporting the detector description, interfacing the event generation, and combining the GEANT4 simulation of the response of the individual detectors. Also described are the tools allowing the software validation, performance testing, and the validation of the simulated output against known physics processes.",

                "Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Comprehensive sets of production and decay measurements are combined. The decay channels include,,,,, and pairs. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 at 7 and up to 19.7 at 8. From the high-resolution and channels, the mass of the Higgs boson is determined to be. For this mass value, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay channels and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal relative to the standard model expectation is at the measured mass. The couplings of the Higgs boson are probed \u2026",

                "A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W-boson pair at the LHC is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb\u2212 1 and 19.4 fb\u2212 1 collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at= 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4.3 standard deviations for m H= 125.6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m H= 125.6 GeV is times the standard model expectation. The spin-parity J P= 0+ hypothesis is favored against a narrow resonance with J P= 2+ or \u2026",

The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.14 fb\u2212 1. In this search, a kinematic variable \u03b1 T is used as the main discriminator between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. No excess of events over the standard model expectation is found. Exclusion limits in the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model are set. In this model, squark masses below 1.1 TeV are excluded at 95% CL Gluino masses below 1.1 TeV are also ruled out at 95% CL for values of the universal scalar mass parameter below 500 GeV.",

                "A search for new physics is performed based on events with jets and a pair of isolated, same-sign leptons. The results are obtained using a sample of proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb\u2212 1. In order to be sensitive to a wide variety of possible signals beyond the standard model, multiple search regions defined by the missing transverse energy, the hadronic energy, the number of jets and b-quark jets, and the transverse momenta of the leptons in the events are considered. No excess above the standard model background expectation is observed and constraints are set on a number of models for new physics, as well as on the same-sign top-quark pair and quadruple-top-quark production cross sections.

In 2012 his group played a central role in the discovery of the Higgs boson using the CMS experiment at the LHC. The discovery sheds light on the fundamental question of the origin of elementary particle mass and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. The exploitation of the Higgs boson and direct searches for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC are the focus of his future research. Markus Klute joined the MIT Physics Department in April 2009 and is currently Associate Professor of Physics. He received his Diploma and Ph.D from Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhems University, Bonn, Germany in 2004 with research on the OPAL, ATLAS and D0 experiments. After earning his Ph.D he joined MIT as a postdoc and later as a research scientist, and worked on the CDF and CMS experiments. In 2007 he accepted a position as Associate Professor with tenure at Goerg-August University in Goettingen, Germany, where he started a research group on the ATLAS experiment before coming back to MIT.
