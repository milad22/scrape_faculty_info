                "The superconducting transition temperature T c in Nb\/Gd multilayers shows a pronounced nonmonotonic dependence on the ferromagnetic Gd layer thickness d Gd for fixed Nb thickness d Nb. For d Nb= 500 and 600 \u00c5, the T c oscillation occurs in the range 10\u2264 d Gd\u2264 40 \u00c5 where the Gd ferromagnetism is well established. These results provide the first evidence for the predicted \u03c0 phase in superconductor\/ferromagnet multilayers where the order parameter in neighboring superconducting layers may have an intrinsic phase difference.",
                "Rectifying diodes of single nanobelt\/nanowire-based devices have been fabricated by aligning single ZnO nanobelts\/nanowires across paired Au electrodes using dielectrophoresis. A current of 0.5 \u03bcA at 1.5 V forward bias has been received, and the diode can bear an applied voltage of up to 10 V. The ideality factor of the diode is \u223c3, and the on-to-off current ratio is as high as 2000. The detailed IV characteristics of the Schottky diodes have been investigated at low temperatures. The formation of the Schottky diodes is suggested due to the asymmetric contacts formed in the dielectrophoresis aligning process. "

                "dd121 Dragomir Davidovic Associate Professor Ph.D., Johns Hopkins, 1996 Exploration of physical properties that emerge in objects when their size approaches nanometer-scale Mesoscopic Physics Low Temperature Physics The area of my research is exploration of physical properties that emerge in objects when their size approaches nanometer-scale. The objects of study are metallic or insulating particles, molecules, atomic-scale diameter wires, and droplets of one phase surrounded by another phase. Recent advances in lithography enable attachment of these objects to larger scale conducting electrodes, making it possible to explore their physical properties by electronic transport. The properties of nanoscale objects can be fundamentally different from those in bulk. As an example, whereas in bulk metals, the energy spectrum of conduction electrons is continuous, in metallic nanoparticles the spectrum is discrete. As a result, metallic nanoparticles are more like atoms than bulk metals, and nanoparticles are commonly referred to as artificial atoms. Research Projects 1) Discrete energy levels in metallic nanoparticles When a metallic particle has a diameter of the order of several nanometers, discrete energy levels can be measured at low temperatures. Discrete energy levels are determined by measuring current as a function of voltage, at milli-Kelvin temperatures, using a nanoparticle connected to two metallic electrodes. The goal of the project is to observe if magnetic and electric response of discrete energy levels reflects complexity of many-electron systems. The observation goes hand in hand with development of theories of electron-electron interactions, dephasing times and other mesoscopic phenomena. 2) Single electron transistors and ferroelectricity Single electron transistors are small devices in which the number of electrons and the electron flow can be controlled with the ultimate limit of one electron at a time. These devices are the most sensitive detectors of electric fields (electrometers). In this project, single electron transistors will be integrated with ferroelectric materials, to create nm-scale permanent memories. The objective is to determine how small a ferroelectric sample can be while retaining memory capabilities. Additionally, fundamental physics of ferroelectric materials at nm-length scale will be explored, including macroscopic quantum tunneling of electric polarization. 3) Gated tips for scanning tunneling microscopy Metallized tips for tunnel effect, containing both a tunneling electrode and a \"gate\" electrode are fabricated in this project. In quantum mechanical tunneling, tunnel resistance depends on a potential energy barrier. The gate electrode induces electric field that modifies the barrier. The gate electrode will be used to learn how electric fields are screened in nm scale metallic structures, to vary the number of electrons in metallic particles, etc. 4) Exploring phase transformations using nm-scale electronics In this project, quantum tunneling through the liquid state will be investigated, to study the dynamics of phase transformations. Recent advances in lithography allow fabrication of tunneling junctions where the insulator is in liquid state. The goal of the project is to measure energy fluctuations in the liquid near phase transformation, to learn about interactions between molecules and nucleation of phases.
