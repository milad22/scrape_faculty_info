                "The superconducting transition temperature T c in Nb\/Gd multilayers shows a pronounced nonmonotonic dependence on the ferromagnetic Gd layer thickness d Gd for fixed Nb thickness d Nb. For d Nb= 500 and 600 \u00c5, the T c oscillation occurs in the range 10\u2264 d Gd\u2264 40 \u00c5 where the Gd ferromagnetism is well established. These results provide the first evidence for the predicted \u03c0 phase in superconductor\/ferromagnet multilayers where the order parameter in neighboring superconducting layers may have an intrinsic phase difference.",
                "Rectifying diodes of single nanobelt\/nanowire-based devices have been fabricated by aligning single ZnO nanobelts\/nanowires across paired Au electrodes using dielectrophoresis. A current of 0.5 \u03bcA at 1.5 V forward bias has been received, and the diode can bear an applied voltage of up to 10 V. The ideality factor of the diode is \u223c3, and the on-to-off current ratio is as high as 2000. The detailed IV characteristics of the Schottky diodes have been investigated at low temperatures. The formation of the Schottky diodes is suggested due to the asymmetric contacts formed in the dielectrophoresis aligning process. "
