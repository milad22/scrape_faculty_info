                "Martin Tzanov Associate Professor of Physics Ph.D., 2005 - University of Pittsburgh 220-B Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-0554-Office mtzanov@phys.lsu.edu Experimental High Energy\u00a0Physics My main research interests are in experimental high energy physics. Currently, my\n                  focus is to uncover the properties of neutrinos. I have been T2K collaborator since\n                  2006. The T2K experiment in Japan is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.\u00a0\n                  It employs a high intensity muon neutrino beam produced at the J-PARC synchrotron\n                  complex near Tokai situated on the east coast.\u00a0 The beam is aimed through the Earth,\n                  295 km away, to the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Kamioka mineon the west coast.\n                  The main goals of the T2K experiment are the precise determination of the \u03b8 13 mixing angle, the search for CP violation in the lepton sector. In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrinos are massless fermions interacting\n                  only via the weak force.\u00a0 In the past decade, several experiments have confirmed the\n                  existence of neutrino oscillation, which is the phenomenon of neutrinos changing their\n                  flavor over a certain distance traveled. Neutrino oscillations not only suggest that\n                  neutrinos have mass, but that the mass eigenstates are non-degenerate. This is clearly\n                  physics beyond the Standard Model, because it requires introduction of new physics\n                  inputs - neutrino masses and mixing parameters.
