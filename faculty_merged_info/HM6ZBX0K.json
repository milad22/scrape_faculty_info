                "We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of \u223c100M\u2299 (whereM\u2299 is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 109 per cubic centimeter, a 1M\u2299 protostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does \u2026",
                "The minimum mass that a virialized gas cloud must have in order to be able to cool in a Hubble time is computed, using a detailed treatment of the chemistry of molecular hydrogen. With a simple model for halo profiles, we reduce the problem to that of numerically integrating a system of chemical equations. The results agree well with numerically expensive three-dimensional simulations, and our approach has the advantage of being able to explore large regions of parameter space rapidly. The minimum baryonic mass M b is found to be strongly redshift dependent, dropping from 10 6 M\u2609 at z~ 15 to 5\u00d7 10 3 M\u2609 at z~ 100 as molecular cooling becomes effective. For z Gt 100, M b rises again, as cosmic microwave background photons inhibit H 2 formation through the H-channel. Finally, for z Gt 200, the H+ 2 channel for H 2 formation becomes effective, driving M b down toward M b~ 10 3 M\u2609. With a standard cold \u2026",
                "The analysis of complex multiphysics astrophysical simulations presents a unique and rapidly growing set of challenges: reproducibility, parallelization, and vast increases in data size and complexity chief among them. In order to meet these challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for collaboration between users of multiple simulation platforms, we present yt (available at http:\/\/yt. enzotools. org\/) an open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and \u2026",
                "Many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc., are thought to be intimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. In particular, the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial initial mass function are of special interest. We present results from high\u2010resolution three\u2010dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the collapse of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation within a cosmologically representative volume. Comoving scales from 128 kpc down to 1 pc are followed accurately. Dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics, and all relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followed self\u2010consistently for a cluster\u2010normalized cold dark matter (CDM) structure formation model. Primordial molecular clouds with \u223c105 solar masses are assembled by \u2026",
                "We have reviewed the chemistry and cooling behaviour of low-density (n< 10^ 4 cm^-3) primordial gas and devised a cooling model wich involves 19 collisional and 9 radiative processes and is applicable for temperatures in the range (1 K< T< 10^ 8 K). We derived new fits of rate coefficients for the photo-attachment of neutral hydrogen, the formation of molecular hydrogen via H-, charge exchange between H2 and H+, electron detachment of H-by neutral hydrogen, dissociative recombination of H2 with slow electrons, photodissociation of H2+, and photodissociation of H2. Further it was found that the molecular hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes, H2++ H-> H2+ H+, and H-+ H-> H2+ e-, is likely to be converted into its para configuration on a faster time scale than the formation time scale. We have tested the model extensively and shown it to agree well with former studies. We further studied the chemical kinetics in great detail and devised a minimal model which is substantially simpler than the full reaction network but predicts correct abundances. This minimal model shows convincingly that 12 collisional processes are sufficient to model the H, He, H+, H-, He+, He++, and H2 abundances in low density primordial gas for applications with no radiation fields.",
                "This paper describes the open-source code Enzo, which uses block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to provide high spatial and temporal resolution for modeling astrophysical fluid flows. The code is Cartesian, can be run in one, two, and three dimensions, and supports a wide variety of physics including hydrodynamics, ideal and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, N-body dynamics (and, more broadly, self-gravity of fluids and particles), primordial gas chemistry, optically thin radiative cooling of primordial and metal-enriched plasmas (as well as some optically-thick cooling models), radiation transport, cosmological expansion, and models for star formation and feedback in a cosmological context. In addition to explaining the algorithms implemented, we present solutions for a wide range of test problems, demonstrate the code's parallel performance, and discuss the Enzo collaboration's code development \u2026",
                "We use cosmological simulations to study the origin of primordial star\u2010forming clouds in a \u039bCDM universe, by following the formation of dark matter halos and the cooling of gas within them. To model the physics of chemically pristine gas, we employ a nonequilibrium treatment of the chemistry of nine species (e\u2212, H, H+, He, He+, He++, H2,  , H\u2212) and include cooling by molecular hydrogen. By considering cosmological volumes, we are able to study the statistical properties of primordial halos, and the high resolution of our simulations enables us to examine these objects in detail. In particular, we explore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts   with total masses in the range \u2248 . We find that when the amount of molecular hydrogen in these objects reaches a critical level, cooling by rotational line emission is efficient, and dense clumps of cold gas form. We identify these \u201cgas clouds\u201d as sites for \u2026",
                "We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological \u2018zoom-in\u2019 simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real-space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first- (1LPT) or second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves rms relative errors of the order of 10\u22124 for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space-induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier-space behaviour as \u2026",
                "We study the formation of the first generation of stars in the standard cold dark matter model. We use a very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that achieves a dynamic range of \u223c1010 in length scale. With accurate treatment of atomic and molecular physics, including the effect of molecular line opacities and cooling by collision\u2010induced continuum emission, it allows us to study the chemothermal evolution of primordial gas clouds to densities up to   g cm\u22123 (  cm\u22123) without assuming any a priori equation of state, an improvement of 6 orders of magnitude over previous three\u2010dimensional calculations. We study the evolution of a primordial star\u2010forming gas cloud in the cosmological simulation in detail. The cloud core becomes marginally unstable against chemothermal instability when the gas cooling rate is increased owing to three\u2010body molecule formation. However, since the core is already \u2026"
