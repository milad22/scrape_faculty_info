                "Background\/Context: Educators have written about and studied school climate for 100 years. School climate refers to the quality and character of school life. School climate is based on patterns of people\u2019s experiences of school life and reflects norms, goals, values, interpersonal relationships, teaching and learning practices, and organizational structures. However, school climate is more than individual experience: It is a group phenomenon that is larger than any one person\u2019s experience. A sustainable, positive school climate fosters youth development and learning necessary for a productive, contributive, and satisfying life in a democratic society. This climate includes norms, values, and expectations that support",
                "For more than a century, there has been a growing interest in school climate. Recently, the U.S. Department of Education, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute for Educational Sciences, a growing number of State Departments of Education, foreign educational ministries, and UNICEF have focused on school climate reform as an evidence-based school improvement strategy that supports students, parents\/guardians, and school personnel learning and working together to create ever safer, more supportive and engaging K\u201312 schools. This work presents an integrative review on school climate research. The 206 citations used in this review include experimental studies, correlational studies, literature reviews, and other descriptive studies. The review focuses on five essential dimensions of school climate: Safety, Relationships, Teaching and Learning, Institutional Environment, and the School \u2026",
                "In this article, Jonathan Cohen argues that the goals of education need to be reframed to prioritize not only academic learning, but also social, emotional, and ethical competencies. Surveying the current state of research in the fields of socialemotional education, character education, and school-based mental health in the United States, Cohen suggests that social-emotional skills, knowledge, and dispositions provide the foundation for participation in a democracy and improved quality of life. Cohen discusses contemporary best practices and policy in relation to creating safe and caring school climates, home-school partnerships, and a pedagogy informed by social-emotional and ethical concerns. He also emphasizes the importance of scientifically sound measures of social-emotional and ethical learning, and advocates for action research partnerships between researchers and practioners to develop authentic \u2026",
                "Social and emotional learning needs to be an integral part of children\u2019s education in conjunction with linguistic, mathematical, aesthetic, kinesthetic, and ethical learning. In this innovative volume, leading national experts describe the range of programs and perspectives that teachers, counsellors, and administrators can use to promote social-emotional education in today\u2019s middle schools. This book will also serve as a useful guide for educators providing concrete strategies, curricular-based programs, and perspectives that can be integrated into school life, inside and outside the classroom. Chapters focus on the importance of comprehensive and integrative programs as well as conflict resolution, self-esteem, and appropriate behaviour in the classroom\u2013including how educators, themselves, can develop in these areas."
