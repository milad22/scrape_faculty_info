                "Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of champion athletes and record performances have been ongoing for about a century. For endurance sports three main factors \u2013 maximal oxygen consumption , the so\u2010called \u2018lactate threshold\u2019 and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a give running speed or cycling power output) \u2013 appear to play key roles in endurance performance.  and lactate threshold interact to determine the \u2018performance \u2018 which is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance  to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the \u2026",
                "OBJECTIVE\u2014 We determined whether reduced insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other age-related dysfunctions are inevitable consequences of aging or secondary to physical inactivity.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014 Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and ATP production in mitochondria isolated from vastus lateralis biopsies of 42 healthy sedentary and endurance-trained young (18\u201330 years old) and older (59\u201376 years old) subjects. Expression of proteins involved in fuel metabolism was measured by mass spectrometry. Citrate synthase activity, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance, and expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors for mitochondrial biogenesis were measured. SIRT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin linked to lifespan-enhancing effects of caloric restriction, was measured by immunoblot.RESULTS\u2014 Insulin-induced glucose \u2026",
                "The mechanisms underlying the skin blood flow (SkBF) response to local heating are complex and poorly understood. Our goal was to examine the role of axon reflexes and nitric oxide (NO) in the SkBF response to a local heating protocol. We performed 40 experiments following a standardized heating protocol with different interventions, including blockade of the axon reflex (EMLA cream), antebrachial nerve blockade (0.5% bupivacaine injection), and NO synthase (NOS) inhibition (\u226510 mMN G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; microdialysis). Appropriate controls were performed to verify the efficacy of the various blocks. Values are expressed as a percentage of maximal SkBF (SkBFmax; 50 mM sodium nitroprusside). At the initiation of local heating, SkBF rose to an initial peak, followed by a brief nadir, and a secondary, progressive rise to a plateau. Axon reflex block decreased the initial peak from 75+3 to 32 \u00b1 2 \u2026",
                "Exercise represents a major challenge to whole-body homeostasis provoking widespread perturbations in numerous cells, tissues, and organs that are caused by or are a response to the increased metabolic activity of contracting skeletal muscles. To meet this challenge, multiple integrated and often redundant responses operate to blunt the homeostatic threats generated by exercise-induced increases in muscle energy and oxygen demand. The application of molecular techniques to exercise biology has provided greater understanding of the multiplicity and complexity of cellular networks involved in exercise responses, and recent discoveries offer perspectives on the mechanisms by which muscle \u201ccommunicates\u201d with other organs and mediates the beneficial effects of exercise on health and performance.",
                "Background\u2014Our goal was to test sympathetic and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and the transduction of sympathetic traffic into vascular resistance during the early follicular (EF) and midluteal (ML) phases of the menstrual cycle.Methods and Results\u2014Sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by lowering and raising blood pressure with intravenous bolus doses of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine. It was defined as the slope relating muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; determined by microneurography) and diastolic blood pressure. Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity was defined as the slope relating R-R interval and systolic blood pressure. Vascular transduction was evaluated during ischemic handgrip exercise and postexercise ischemia, and it was defined as the slope relating MSNA and calf vascular resistance (determined by plethysmography). Resting MSNA (EF, 1170\u00b1151 U\/min \u2026",
                "Seven endurance exercise-trained subjects were studied 12, 21, 56, and 84 days after cessation of training. Maximal O2 uptake (VO2 max) declined 7% (P less than 0.05) during the first 21 days of inactivity and stabilized after 56 days at a level 16% (P less than 0.05) below the initial trained value. After 84 days of detraining the experimental subjects still had a higher VO2 max than did eight sedentary control subjects who had never trained (50.8 vs. 43.3 ml X kg-1 X min-1), due primarily to a larger arterial-mixed venous O2 (a-vO2) difference. Stroke volume (SV) during exercise was high initially and declined during the early detraining period to a level not different from control. Skeletal muscle capillarization did not decline with inactivity and remained 50% above (P less than 0.05) sedentary control. Citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activities in muscle declined with a half-time of 12 days and stabilized \u2026",
                "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis. To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e. \u201cconvalescent\u201d) plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and\/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been \u2026",
                "In humans, exercise training and moderate to high levels of physical activity are protective against cardiovascular disease. In fact they are \u223c40% more protective than predicted based on the changes in traditional risk factors (blood lipids, hypertension, diabetes etc.) that they cause. In this review, we highlight the positive effects of exercise on endothelial function and the autonomic nervous system. We also ask if these effects alone, or in combination, might explain the protective effects of exercise against cardiovascular disease that appear to be independent of traditional risk factor modification. Our goal is to use selected data from our own work and that of others to stimulate debate on the nature and cause of the \u2018risk factor gap\u2019 associated with exercise and physical activity.",
                "This review focuses on how blood flow to contracting skeletal muscles is regulated during exercise in humans. The idea is that blood flow to the contracting muscles links oxygen in the atmosphere with the contracting muscles where it is consumed. In this context, we take a top down approach and review the basics of oxygen consumption at rest and during exercise in humans, how these values change with training, and the systemic hemodynamic adaptations that support them. We highlight the very high muscle blood flow responses to exercise discovered in the 1980s. We also discuss the vasodilating factors in the contracting muscles responsible for these very high flows. Finally, the competition between demand for blood flow by contracting muscles and maximum systemic cardiac output is discussed as a potential challenge to blood pressure regulation during heavy large muscle mass or whole body exercise in \u2026",
                "Physical inactivity increases the risk of many chronic disorders. Numerous studies have convincingly demonstrated that undertaking and maintaining moderate levels of physical activity (eg, brisk walking 3 hours a week) greatly reduces the incidence of developing many chronic health conditions, most notably type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and many types of cancers. However, the underlying mechanistic details of how physical activity confers such protective effects are not well understood and consequently constitute an active area of research. Although changing an individual's ingrained behavior is commonly perceived to be difficult, encouraging evidence suggests that intensive and repeated counseling by health care professionals can cause patients to become more physically active. Therefore, counseling patients to undertake physical activity to prevent chronic health conditions \u2026"
