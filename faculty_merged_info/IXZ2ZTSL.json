                "We achieve tunneling spin injection from Co into single layer graphene (SLG) using TiO 2 seeded MgO barriers. A nonlocal magnetoresistance (\u0394 R NL) of 130 \u03a9 is observed at room temperature, which is the largest value observed in any material. Investigating \u0394 R NL vs SLG conductivity from the transparent to the tunneling contact regimes demonstrates the contrasting behaviors predicted by the drift-diffusion theory of spin transport. Furthermore, tunnel barriers reduce the contact-induced spin relaxation and are therefore important for future investigations of spin relaxation in graphene.",
                "We investigate the effects of transition metals (TM) on the electronic doping and scattering in graphene using molecular-beam epitaxy combined with in situ transport measurements. The room-temperature deposition of TM onto graphene produces clusters that dope n type for all TM investigated (Ti, Fe, and Pt). We also find that the scattering by TM clusters exhibits different behavior compared to 1\/r Coulomb scattering. At high coverage, Pt films are able to produce doping that is either n type or weakly p type, which provides experimental evidence for a strong interfacial dipole favoring n-type doping as predicted theoretically.",
                "The effects of surface chemical doping on spin transport in graphene are investigated by performing nonlocal measurements in ultrahigh vacuum while depositing gold adsorbates. We demonstrate manipulation of the gate-dependent nonlocal spin signal as a function of gold coverage. We discover that charged impurity scattering is not the dominant mechanism for spin relaxation in graphene, despite its importance for momentum scattering. Finally, unexpected enhancements of the spin lifetime illustrate the complex nature of spin relaxation in graphene.",
                "Spin accumulation and spin precession in single layer graphene are studied by nonlocal spin valve measurements at room temperature. The dependence of the nonlocal magnetoresistance on electrode spacing is investigated and the results indicate a spin diffusion length of \u223c1.6\u2002\u03bcm and a spin injection\/detection efficiency of 0.013. Electrical detection of the spin precession confirms that the nonlocal signal originates from spin injection and transport. Fitting of the Hanle spin precession data yields a spin relaxation time of \u223c84\u2002ps and a spin diffusion length of \u223c1.5\u2002\u03bcm, which is consistent with the value obtained through the spacing dependence.",
                "We review our recent work on spin injection, transport and relaxation in graphene. The spin injection and transport in single layer graphene (SLG) were investigated using nonlocal magnetoresistance (MR) measurements. Spin injection was performed using either transparent contacts (Co\/SLG) or tunneling contacts (Co\/MgO\/SLG). With tunneling contacts, the nonlocal MR was increased by a factor of \u223c1000 and the spin injection\/detection efficiency was greatly enhanced from \u223c1% (transparent contacts) to \u223c30%. Spin relaxation was investigated on graphene spin valves using nonlocal Hanle measurements. For transparent contacts, the spin lifetime was in the range of 50\u2013100 ps. The effects of surface chemical doping showed that for spin lifetimes in the order of 100 ps, charged impurity scattering (Au) was not the dominant mechanism for spin relaxation. While using tunneling contacts to suppress the contact \u2026",
                "Spin-dependent properties of single-layer graphene (SLG) have been studied by nonlocal spin valve measurements at room temperature. Gate voltage dependence shows that the nonlocal magnetoresistance (MR) is proportional to the conductivity of the SLG, which is the predicted behavior for transparent ferromagnetic-nonmagnetic contacts. While the electron and hole bands in SLG are symmetric, gate voltage and bias dependence of the nonlocal MR reveal an electron-hole asymmetry in which the nonlocal MR is roughly independent of bias for electrons, but varies significantly with bias for holes.",
                "We report the magnetoresistance (MR) properties of quasi-two-dimensional mesoscopic graphite (MG) spin valve devices consisting of MG flakes contacted by ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes. For devices in which an ultrathin magnesium oxide (MgO) tunnel barrier is inserted at the FM\/MG interface, the spin valve effect has been observed, with MR magnitudes up to 12% at 7 K and signals persisting up to temperatures as high as 60 K. In contrast, the spin valve effect has not been seen in devices without MgO, suggesting the importance of spin-dependent interfacial resistance for spin injection into MG. In addition, an investigation of the voltage bias dependence and gate voltage dependence of MR has been performed."
