                "The chiral anomaly provides smoking-gun evidence of a new confining gauge theory. Motivated by a reported event excess in a diphoton invariant mass distribution at the LHC, we discuss a scenario that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (PNG) boson of a new QCD-like theory is produced by gluon fusion and decays into a pair of the standard model gauge bosons. Despite the strong dynamics, the production cross section and the decay widths are determined by an anomaly matching condition. The excess can be explained by the PNG boson with mass of around 750 GeV. The model also predicts exotic hadrons such as a color-octet scalar and baryons. Some of them are within the reach of the LHC experiment.",
                "We introduce four different types of data-driven analyses with different levels of robustness that constrain the size of the Higgs\u2013charm Yukawa coupling:(i) Recasting the vector-boson associated V h analyses that search for the bottom-pair final state. We use this mode to directly and model independently constrain the Higgs-to-charm coupling, y c\/y c SM\u2272 234.(ii) The direct measurement of the total width, y c\/y c SM\u2272 120\u2013140.(iii) The search for h\u2192 J\/\u03c8 \u03b3, y c\/y c SM\u2272 220.(iv) A global fit to the Higgs signal strengths, y c\/y c SM\u2272 6.2. A comparison with t t h data allows us to show that the Higgs does not couple to quarks in a universal way, as is expected in the Standard Model. Finally, we demonstrate how the experimental collaborations can further improve our direct bound by roughly an order of magnitude by charm tagging, as is already used in new-physics searches.",
                "We discuss the prospects to probe the light-quark Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. The Higgs coupling to the charm quark can be probed both via inclusive and exclusive approaches. On the inclusive frontier, we use our recently proposed method together with published experimental studies for the sensitivity of the Higgs coupling to bottom quarks to find that the high-luminosity LHC can be sensitive to modifications of the charm Yukawa of the order of a few times its standard model (SM) value. We also present a preliminary study of this mode for a 100 TeV hadronic machine (with similar luminosity) and find that the bound can be further improved, possibly within the reach of the expected signal in the SM. On the exclusive frontier, we use the recent ATLAS search for charmonia and photon final state. This study yields the first measurement of the background relevant to these modes. Using this background \u2026",
                "We consider the absorption by bound electrons of dark matter in the form of dark photons and axion-like particles, as well as of dark photons from the Sun, in current and next-generation direct detection experiments. Experiments sensitive to electron recoils can detect such particles with masses between a few eV to more than 10 keV. For dark photon dark matter, we update a previous bound based on XENON10 data and derive new bounds based on data from XENON100 and CDMSlite. We find these experiments to disfavor previously allowed parameter space. Moreover, we derive sensitivity projections for SuperCDMS at SNOLAB for silicon and germanium targets, as well as for various possible experiments with scintillating targets (cesium iodide, sodium iodide, and gallium arsenide). The projected sensitivity can probe large new regions of parameter space. For axion-like particles, the same current direction \u2026",
                "We calculate all gauge invariant Barr-Zee type contributions to fermionic electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the two-Higgs doublet models (2HDM) with softly broken Z 2 symmetry. We start by studying the tensor structure of h\u2192 VV\u2032 part in the Barr-Zee diagrams, and we calculate the effective couplings in a gauge invariant way by using the pinch technique. Then we calculate all Barr-Zee diagrams relevant for electron and neutron EDMs. We make bounds on the parameter space in type-I, type-II, type-X, and type-Y 2HDMs. The electron and neutron EDMs are complementary to each other in discrimination of the 2HDMs. Type-II and type-X 2HDMs are strongly constrained by recent ACME experiment\u2019s result, and future experiments of electron and neutron EDMs may search(10) TeV physics.",
                "This is the third out of five chapters of the final report [1] of the Workshop on Physics at HL-LHC, and perspectives on HE-LHC [2]. It is devoted to the study of the potential, in the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, of the High Luminosity (HL) phase of the LHC, defined as  of data taken at a centre-of-mass energy of , and of a possible future upgrade, the High Energy (HE) LHC, defined as  of data at a centre-of-mass energy of . We consider a large variety of new physics models, both in a simplified model fashion and in a more model-dependent one. A long list of contributions from the theory and experimental (ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) communities have been collected and merged together to give a complete, wide, and consistent view of future prospects for BSM physics at the considered colliders. On top of the usual standard candles, such as supersymmetric simplified models and resonances, considered for the evaluation of future collider potentials, this report contains results on dark matter and dark sectors, long lived particles, leptoquarks, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, heavy scalars, vector-like quarks, and more. Particular attention is placed, especially in the study of the HL-LHC prospects, to the detector upgrades, the assessment of the future systematic uncertainties, and new experimental techniques. The general conclusion is that the HL-LHC, on top of allowing to extend the present LHC mass and coupling reach by  on most new physics scenarios, will also be able to constrain, and potentially discover, new physics that is presently unconstrained. Moreover, compared to the HL-LHC, the \u2026",
                "We derive a new bound on diphoton resonances using inclusive diphoton cross section measurements at the LHC, in the so-far poorly constrained mass range between the \u03d2 and the SM Higgs. This bound sets the current best limit on axion-like particles that couple to gluons and photons, for masses between 10 and 65 GeV. We also estimate indicative sensitivities of a dedicated diphoton LHC search in the same mass region, at 7, 8 and 14 TeV. As a byproduct of our analysis, we comment on the axion-like particle interpretation of the CMS excesses in low-mass dijet and diphoton searches.",
                "The KOTO experiment recently reported four candidate events in the signal region of K L\u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03bd search, where the standard model only expects 0.10\u00b10.02 events. If confirmed, this requires physics beyond the standard model to enhance the signal. We examine various new physics interpretations of the result including these:(1) heavy new physics boosting the standard model signal,(2) reinterpretation of \u201c\u03bd \u03bd\u201d as a new light long-lived particle, or (3) reinterpretation of the whole signal as the production of a new light long-lived particle at the fixed target. We study the above explanations in the context of a generalized new physics Grossman-Nir bound coming from the K+\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03bd \u03bd decay, bounded by data from the E949 and the NA62 experiments.",
                "We study the diphoton signal of the Higgs boson in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models, which can explain both the Higgs boson mass of around 125 GeV and the result of the muon g\u2212 2 experiment. We consider two possible extensions of gauge mediation models: inclusion of vector-like matters, and a mixing between a messenger and the up-type Higgs. The large left\u2013right mixing of staus is induced in both scenarios, resulting in the enhanced diphoton signal. We include a constraint from a charge breaking minimum, which is severe for the large left\u2013right mixing of staus. The branching fraction of h\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 can be about 20\u201330% larger than that of the Standard Model Higgs boson, in the region of parameter space where the Higgs boson mass of around 125 GeV and the muon g\u2212 2 are explained.",
                "Vector-like quarks are introduced in various new physics models beyond the standard model (SM) at the TeV scale. We especially consider the case that the quark is singlet (triplet) under the SU (2) L (SU (3) c) gauge group and couples only to the third-generation quarks of the SM. The vector-like quark of this kind is often called a top partner. The top partner t p decays into b W, t Z, and t h. In the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, the top partner has been searched in the final states of b W and t Z, while the search based on the decay mode t p\u2192 t h has not been started yet. However, the decay into t h is important, since it is significantly enhanced if some strong dynamics exists in the TeV scale. In the presence of a light Higgs boson, the decay mode t p\u2192 t h followed by h\u2192 b b produces three bottom quarks. We study the sensitivity for the top partner using multi-b-jet events at the 8 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider \u2026"
