                "The parent compounds of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors are unusual insulators (so-called Mott insulators). Superconductivity arises when they are \u2018doped\u2019away from stoichiometry 1. For the compound Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x, doping is achieved by adding extra oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (\u2018holes\u2019) into the CuO 2 planes where the superconductivity is believed to originate. Aside from providing the charge carriers, the role of the oxygen dopants is not well understood, nor is it clear how the charge carriers are distributed on the planes. Many models of high-T c superconductivity accordingly assume that the introduced carriers are distributed uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system as in ordinary metals. Here we report the presence of an electronic inhomogeneity in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x, on the basis of observations using \u2026",
                "Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to image the additional quasi-particle states generated by quantized vortices in the high critical temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4. They exhibit a copper-oxygen bond\u2013oriented \u201ccheckerboard\u201d pattern, with four unit cell (4a0) periodicity and a \u223c30 angstrom decay length. These electronic modulations may be related to the magnetic field\u2013induced, 8a0periodic, spin density modulations with decay length of \u223c70 angstroms recently discovered in La1.84Sr0.16CuO4. The proposed explanation is a spin density wave localized surrounding each vortex core. General theoretical principles predict that, in the cuprates, a localized spin modulation of wavelength \u03bb should be associated with a corresponding electronic modulation of wavelength \u03bb\/2, in good agreement with our observations.",
                "Granular superconductivity occurs when microscopic superconducting grains are separated by non-superconducting regions; Josephson tunnelling between the grains establishes the macroscopic superconducting state 1. Although crystals of the copper oxide high-transition-temperature (high-T c) superconductors are not granular in a structural sense, theory suggests that at low levels of hole doping the holes can become concentrated at certain locations resulting in hole-rich superconducting domains 2, 3, 4, 5. Granular superconductivity arising from tunnelling between such domains would represent a new view of the underdoped copper oxide superconductors. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscope studies of underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 that reveal an apparent segregation of the electronic structure into superconducting domains that are\u223c 3 nm in size (and local energy gap< 50 meV), located \u2026",
                "Although the crystal structures of the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors are complex and diverse, they all contain some crystal planes consisting of only copper and oxygen atoms in a square lattice: superconductivity is believed to originate from strongly interacting electrons in these CuO 2 planes. Substituting a single impurity atom for a copper atom strongly perturbs the surrounding electronic environment and can therefore be used to probe high-temperature superconductivity at the atomic scale. This has provided the motivation for several experimental 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and theoretical studies 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is an ideal technique for the study of such effects at the atomic scale, as it has been used very successfully to probe individual impurity atoms in several other systems 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Here we use STM to investigate the effects \u2026",
                "The doping dependence of nanoscale electronic structure in superconducting Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca Cu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. At all dopings, the low energy density-of-states modulations are analyzed according to a simple model of quasiparticle interference and found to be consistent with Fermi-arc superconductivity. The superconducting coherence peaks, ubiquitous in near-optimal tunneling spectra, are destroyed with strong underdoping and a new spectral type appears. Exclusively in regions exhibiting this new spectrum, we find local \u201ccheckerboard\u201d charge ordering of high energy states, with a wave vector of Q\u2192=(\u00b12 \u03c0\/4.5 a 0, 0);(0,\u00b12 \u03c0\/4.5 a 0)\u00b115%. Surprisingly, this spatial ordering of high energy states coexists harmoniously with the low energy Bogoliubov quasiparticle states.",
                "One of the main challenges in understanding high-T c superconductivity is to disentangle the rich variety of states of matter that may coexist, cooperate or compete with d-wave superconductivity. At centre stage is the pseudogap phase, which occupies a large portion of the cuprate phase diagram surrounding the superconducting dome 1. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we find that a static, non-dispersive,\u2018checkerboard\u2019-like electronic modulation exists in a broad regime of the cuprate phase diagram and exhibits strong doping dependence. The continuous increase of checkerboard periodicity with hole density strongly suggests that the checkerboard originates from charge-density-wave formation in the antinodal region of the cuprate Fermi surface. These results reveal a coherent picture for static electronic orderings in the cuprates and shed important new light on the nature of the pseudogap phase.",
                "Magnetic interactions and magnetic impurities are destructive to superconductivity in conventional superconductors 1. By contrast, in some unconventional macroscopic quantum systems (such as superfluid 3 He and superconducting UGe 2), the superconductivity (or superfluidity) is actually mediated by magnetic interactions. A magnetic mechanism has also been proposed for high-temperature superconductivity 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Within this context, the fact that magnetic Ni impurity atoms have a weaker effect on superconductivity than non-magnetic Zn atoms in the high-T c superconductors has been put forward as evidence supporting a magnetic mechanism 5, 6. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to determine directly the influence of individual Ni atoms on the local electronic structure of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4. At each Ni site we observe two d-wave impurity states 7, 8 of apparently opposite spin \u2026",
                "We report on low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of the electronic structure of vortex cores in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4. At the vortex core center, an enhanced density of states is observed at energies near \u03a9=\u00b17 meV. Spectroscopic imaging at these energies reveals an exponential decay of these \u201ccore states\u201d with a decay length of 22\u00b13 \u212b. The fourfold symmetry sometimes predicted for d-wave vortices is not seen in spectroscopic vortex images. A locally nodeless order parameter induced by the magnetic field may be consistent with these measurements.",
                "We describe the design and development of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) which can operate at temperatures down to 240 mK and in magnetic fields up to 7 T with high spatial and energy resolution. The compact and rigid STM head is mounted directly on a low vibration, single shot, 3He refrigerator. This refrigerator can be operated at its base temperature continuously for several days before the 3He needs to be recondensed. The system is equipped with a sample transport manipulator from room temperature, and a cleavage device at low temperature, so that the cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum condition inside the cryostat can be utilized. A superconducting magnet provides a magnetic field of up to 7 T at the sample along the STM tip direction. Test results have shown that, at the base temperature, this instrument has better than 0.5 pm z-direction resolution in imaging mode, and better than 20 \u03bcV energy \u2026",
                "The nature and behaviour of electronic states in high-temperature superconductors are the centre of much debate. The pseudogap state, observed above the superconducting transition temperature, T c, is seen by some as a precursor to the superconducting state. Others view it as a competing phase. Recently, this discussion has focused on the number of energy gaps in the system. Some experiments indicate a single energy gap, implying that the pseudogap is a precursor state. Others indicate two, suggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here, we use temperature-dependent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of (Bi 1\u2212 y Pb y) 2 Sr 2 CuO 6+ x to clarify the situation. We find a previously unobserved narrow and homogeneous gap that vanishes near T c, superimposed on the typically observed inhomogeneous and broad gap, which is only weakly temperature dependent. These results not only support \u2026"
