                "The most precise determination of the neutron lifetime using the beam method was completed in 2005 and reported a result of \u03c4 n=(886.3\u00b11.2 [stat]\u00b13.2 [syst]) s. The dominant uncertainties were attributed to the absolute determination of the fluence of the neutron beam (2.7 s). The fluence was measured with a neutron monitor that counted the neutron-induced charged particles from absorption in a thin, well-characterized Li 6 deposit. The detection efficiency of the monitor was calculated from the areal density of the deposit, the detector solid angle, and the evaluated nuclear data file, ENDF\/B-VI Li 6 (n, t) He 4 thermal neutron cross section. In the current work, we measure the detection efficiency of the same monitor used in the neutron lifetime measurement with a second, totally absorbing neutron detector. This direct approach does not rely on the Li 6 (n, t) He 4 cross section or any other nuclear data. The detection \u2026",
                "The decay of the free neutron into a proton, electron, and antineutrino is the prototype semileptonic weak decay and is the simplest example of nuclear beta decay. It played a key role in the early Universe as it determined the ratio of neutrons to protons during the era of primordial light element nucleosynthesis. Neutron decay is physically related to important processes in solar physics and neutrino detection. The mean neutron lifetime has been the subject of more than 20 major experiments done, using a variety of methods, between 1950 and the present. The most precise recent measurements have stated accuracies approaching 0.1%, but are not in good agreement as they differ by as much as 5 \u03c3 using quoted uncertainties. The history of neutron lifetime measurements is reviewed and the different methods used are described, giving important examples of each. The discrepancies and some systematic issues in \u2026",
                "Accurate measurement of the lifetime of the neutron (which is unstable to beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force 1 and the creation of matter during the Big Bang 2. Previous measurements of the neutron lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors 3; however, these could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in a magnetic trap. Neutral-particle and charged-particle traps are widely used for studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long interaction times and isolation of particles from perturbing environments 4. Here we report the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with superfluid 4 He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons in the trap have a lifetime of 750+ 330-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap \u2026",
                "A measurement of the neutron lifetime \u03c4 n performed by the absolute counting of in-beam neutrons and their decay protons has been completed. Protons confined in a quasi-Penning trap were accelerated onto a silicon detector held at a high potential and counted with nearly unit efficiency. The neutrons were counted by a device with an efficiency inversely proportional to neutron velocity, which cancels the dwell time of the neutron beam in the trap. The result is \u03c4 n=(886.3\u00b11.2 [stat]\u00b13.2 [sys]) s, which is the most precise measurement of the lifetime using an in-beam method. The systematic uncertainty is dominated by neutron counting, in particular, the mass of the deposit and the Li 6 (n, t) cross section. The measurement technique and apparatus, data analysis, and investigation of systematic uncertainties are discussed in detail.",
                "We describe an experiment that has set new limits on the time reversal invariance violating D coefficient in neutron \u03b2 decay. The emiT experiment measured the angular correlation< J>\u22c5(p e\u00d7 p p) using an octagonal symmetry that optimizes electron-proton coincidence rates. The result is D=[\u2212 0.6\u00b11. 2 (stat)\u00b10. 5 (syst)]\u00d7 10\u2212 3. This improves constraints on the phase of g A\/g V and limits contributions to T violation due to leptoquarks. This paper presents details of the experiment, data analysis, and the investigation of systematic effects.",
                "Neutron spin filters based on polarized 3 He are useful over a wide neutron energy range and have a large angular acceptance among other advantages. Two optical pumping methods, spin-exchange and metastability-exchange, can produce the volume of highly polarized 3 He gas required for such neutron spin filters. We report a test of polarizers based on each of these two methods on a new cold, monochromatic neutron beam line at the NIST Center for Neutron Research.",
                "The weak interaction between neutrons and protons has never been resolved experimentally. In analogy with the strong NN interaction, the weak NN interaction at low energy can be parametrized in terms of a meson exchange model with parity violating meson\u2013nucleon couplings. Unlike the measured proton\u2013proton weak interaction, the neutron\u2013proton weak interaction is sensitive to the weak pion\u2013nucleon coupling constant H\u03c01. This coupling, which is responsible for the longest-ranged part of the weak NN interaction and is therefore an essential part of any description of weak interactions in nuclei, remains undetermined despite many years of effort. A measurement of the gamma ray directional asymmetry A\u03b3 in the capture of polarized neutrons by parahydrogen has been proposed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The goal of this experiment is to determine A\u03b3 with a relative standard uncertainty of <5\u00d710\u22129 \u2026",
                "We report a new measurement of the neutron decay lifetime by the absolute counting of in-beam neutrons and their decay protons. Protons were confined in a quasi-Penning trap and counted with a silicon detector. The neutron beam fluence was measured by capture in a thin L i F 6 foil detector with known absolute efficiency. The combination of these simultaneous measurements gives the neutron lifetime: \u03c4 n=(886.8\u00b11.2 [s t a t]\u00b13.2 [s y s t]) s. The systematic uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the mass of the L i F 6 deposit and the L i 6 (n, t) cross section. This is the most precise measurement of the neutron lifetime to date using an in-beam method.",
                "We have measured the electron-capture decay branch of Tc 100 to be (1.8\u00b10.9)\u00d7 10\u2212 3%, from which we deduce logft= 4. 45\u2212 0.30+ 0.18. This indicates that a two-step process connecting only the ground states of\u2212 100 100 Tc\u2212 100 Ru can account for the measured 2\u03bd double-\u03b2-decay rate of Mo 100.",
                "We present the results of two separate measurements of the half-life of 44 Ti relative to those of 22 Na and 207 Bi, respectively. By comparing the numbers of 1157-keV \u03b3 rays from 44 Ti to those of 1274-keV \u03b3 rays from 22 Na observed from a mixed source over a period of approximately 2 yr, we determined the half-life of 44 Ti to be 61.5\u00b11.0 yr. From an approximately 1-yr-long study of another mixed source, where we compared the numbers of 1157-keV \u03b3 rays from 44 Ti to those of 1064-keV \u03b3 rays from 207 Bi, we determined the 44 Ti half-life to be 62\u00b15 yr. From these two results, we have obtained a best value of 62\u00b12 yr for the half-life of 44 Ti. The astrophysical implications of this result are discussed."
