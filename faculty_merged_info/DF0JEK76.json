                "Metasurfaces composed of planar arrays of subwavelength artificial structures show promise for extraordinary light manipulation. They have yielded novel ultrathin optical components such as flat lenses, wave plates, holographic surfaces, and orbital angular momentum manipulation and detection over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the optical properties of metasurfaces developed to date do not allow for versatile tunability of reflected or transmitted wave amplitude and phase after their fabrication, thus limiting their use in a wide range of applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a gate-tunable metasurface that enables dynamic electrical control of the phase and amplitude of the plane wave reflected from the metasurface. Tunability arises from field-effect modulation of the complex refractive index of conducting oxide layers incorporated into metasurface antenna elements which \u2026"

Before joining UCI, he was an Associated Professor in the Department of Physics at Baylor University and IQSE Fellow and visiting professor in the Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering (IQSE) at TexasA&M. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech during 2012-2015, working with Prof. Harry Atwater in active plasmonics\/metasurfaces. He received his PhD in Physics from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Germany in 2012 under the supervision of Prof. Philip Russell (2015 President of OSA). His current research focuses on active linear, nonlinear, and quantum plasmonic\/metasurface\/zero-index optics, quantum biophotonics and imaging, \u201cmeta\u201d-fiber optics, and hybrid photonic-plasmonic on-chip optical devices. His work on nano-optics, plasmonics, and photonic crystals has led to 35 journal publications in various journals, such as Science , Nano Letters , Advanced Materials , ACS Photonics , and Laser & Photonics Reviews as well as 50 invited talks and 130 conference papers. Dr. Lee is a recipient of a 2020 SPIE Rising Researcher, a 2020 Baylor Outstanding Professor Award, a 2019 DARPA Director\u2019s Fellowship, a 2019 IEEE OGC Young Scientist Award, a 2018 NSF CAREER Award, a 2017 DARPA Young Faculty Award, a 2018 OSA Ambassador, a 2017 APS Robert S. Hyer Award, a 2018 Baylor Young Investigator Award, a 2016 Baylor Proposal Development Award, and a 2012 Croucher Postdoctoral Fellowship. He organized more than 10 technical sessions in nanophotonics\/metasurfaces in international conferences (CLEO, META, PQE, MRS) and serves as Symposium Organizer for plasmonic\/metasurface symposiums at MRS 2019 Fall Meeting, 2020 Spring Meeting, 2020 Fall Meeting, and 2021 Spring Meeting. He is a Founding Associate Editor for OSA Continuum and Associate Editor for Nature Scientific Reports journals. His group has awarded for external grants with total amount of > $4M in the last four years.
