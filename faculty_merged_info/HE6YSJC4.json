                "We report on a new test of Lorentz invariance performed by comparing the resonance frequencies of two orthogonal cryogenic optical resonators subject to Earth\u2019s rotation over\u223c 1 y r. For a possible anisotropy of the speed of light c, we obtain \u0394 \u03b8 c\/c 0=(2.6\u00b11.7)\u00d7 10\u2212 15. Within the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl (RMS) test theory, this implies an isotropy violation parameter \u03b2\u2212 \u03b4\u2212 1 2=(\u2212 2.2\u00b11.5)\u00d7 10\u2212 9, about 3 times lower than the best previous result. Within the general extension of the standard model of particle physics, we extract limits on seven parameters at accuracies down to 10\u2212 15, improving the best previous result by about 2 orders of magnitude.",
                "Measurements of the fine-structure constant \u03b1 require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: \u03b1 = 1\/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge \u2212 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge \u2212 2; a 2.5\u03c3 tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon\u2019s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level \u2026",
                "We present a test of the local Lorentz invariance of post-Newtonian gravity by monitoring Earth\u2019s gravity with a Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer that features a resolution of up to 8\u00d7 10\u2212 9 g\/Hz, the highest reported thus far. Expressed within the standard model extension (SME) or Nordtvedt\u2019s anisotropic universe model, the analysis limits four coefficients describing anisotropic gravity at the ppb level and three others, for the first time, at the 10 ppm level. Using the SME we explicitly demonstrate how the experiment actually compares the isotropy of gravity and electromagnetism.",
                "One of the central predictions of metric theories of gravity, such as general relativity, is that a clock in a gravitational potential U will run more slowly by a factor of 1+ U\/c 2, where c is the velocity of light, as compared to a similar clock outside the potential 1. This effect, known as gravitational redshift, is important to the operation of the global positioning system 2, timekeeping 3, 4 and future experiments with ultra-precise, space-based clocks 5 (such as searches for variations in fundamental constants). The gravitational redshift has been measured using clocks on a tower 6, an aircraft 7 and a rocket 8, currently reaching an accuracy of 7\u00d7 10-5. Here we show that laboratory experiments based on quantum interference of atoms 9, 10 enable a much more precise measurement, yielding an accuracy of 7\u00d7 10-9. Our result supports the view that gravity is a manifestation of space-time curvature, an underlying principle of \u2026",
                "We present up to 24-photon Bragg diffraction as a beam splitter in light-pulse atom interferometers to achieve the largest splitting in momentum space so far. Relative to the 2-photon processes used in the most sensitive present interferometers, these large momentum transfer beam splitters increase the phase shift 12-fold for Mach-Zehnder (MZ) and 144-fold for Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 (RB) geometries. We achieve a high visibility of the interference fringes (up to 52% for MZ or 36% for RB) and long pulse separation times that are possible only in atomic fountain setups. As the atom\u2019s internal state is not changed, important systematic effects can cancel.",
                "If dark energy, which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, consists of a light scalar field, it might be detectable as a \u201cfifth force\u201d between normal-matter objects, in potential conflict with precision tests of gravity. Chameleon fields and other theories with screening mechanisms, however, can evade these tests by suppressing the forces in regions of high density, such as the laboratory. Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber, we reduced the screening mechanism by probing the field with individual atoms rather than with bulk matter. We thereby constrained a wide class of dark energy theories, including a range of chameleon and other theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration.",
                "A 190-day comparison of the optical frequencies defined by an optical cavity and a molecular electronic transition is analyzed for the velocity independence of the speed of light (Kennedy-Thorndike test) and the universality of the gravitational redshift. The modulation of the laboratory velocity and the gravitational potential were provided by Earth\u2019s orbital motion around the Sun. We find a velocity-dependence coefficient of (1.9\u00b12.1)\u00d7 10\u2212 5, 3 times lower compared to the best previous test. Alternatively, the data confirm the gravitational redshift for an electronic transition at the 4% level. Prospects for significant improvements of the tests are discussed."
