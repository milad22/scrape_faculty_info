                "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly recognized as the single most important cause of disabling ischemic stroke in the elderly. We undertook an international survey to characterize the frequency of AF-associated stroke, methods of AF detection, and patient features.Consecutive patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke in 2013 to 2014 were surveyed from 19 stroke research centers in 19 different countries. Data were analyzed by global regions and World Bank income levels.Of 2144 patients with ischemic stroke, 590 (28%; 95% confidence interval, 25.6\u201329.5) had AF-associated stroke, with highest frequencies in North America (35%) and Europe (33%) and lowest in Latin America (17%). Most had a history of AF before stroke (15%) or newly detected AF on electrocardiography (10%); only 2% of patients with ischemic stroke had unsuspected AF detected by \u2026",
                "Background Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) recurrence and functional outcome from long-term follow-up is not well delineated. The purpose of this study is to compare these functional variables between ESUS vs. cardioembolic stroke (CS) patients.   Methods We analyzed data of consecutive ESUS and CS patients from our institutional database, from January 2003 until April 2015. The endpoints were stroke recurrence, mortality and poor clinical outcome (Modified Rankin Score 3\u20136), at discharge, 6 months and final follow-up. Adjusted multivariate Cox analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of recurrence and death.   Results 149 ESUS (median age 44 years) and 235 CS (median age 66 years) consecutive patients were included in the study. Median follow-up period for the entire sample was 19 months (interquartile range 6.0\u201345.0 months). Stroke recurrence was similar between ESUS and CS patients (5.4% vs. 9.8% respectively, p = 0.12). Death occurred in 30 CS cases (12.8%), with a cumulative probability of survival of 77%. Poor functional outcome was present in 58.3%, 54.0% and 54.9% at discharge, 6 months and final follow-up respectively in CS patients, significantly worst compared to ESUS cases (HR 3.1; CI 95% 1.96\u20134.68). Oral anticoagulation presents with a HR 8.01 for recurrence, and antiplatelet therapy had the highest risk for recurrence for both groups (HR 24.3).   Conclusion ESUS patients are substantially younger than CS patients but have a stroke recurrence rate similar to CS patients, with a lower mortality rate, and better functional outcome on long-term follow-up.",
                "ObjectiveNon-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke (IS) and a powerful predictor of mortality. This study investigates early and long-term outcome among patients with IS secondary to NVAF and identify the main factors associated with poor outcome, recurrence, and death.MethodsWe analyzed the data from our consecutive NVAF acute IS database, over a period of 23 years. The endpoints were bad outcome (Modified Rankin Score\u2265 3), recurrence, and mortality at discharge, after 6 months, 12 months, and final follow-up. Multivariate Cox and Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis were used to estimate the probability of death.Results129 consecutive acute IS patients were included (77 [59.7%] females, mean age 70.2\u00b110.1 years). Discharge, 6 and 12 months bad outcome was 62%, 63%, and 61%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 6\u201354.5), 35.6% patients had bad \u2026",
                "Few studies have examined collateral formation in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of baseline intracranial venous collaterals on the clinical outcome and imaging features of patients with acute CVT.MRIs from consecutive patients with acute CVT were retrospectively analysed. The category system described by Qureshi was used to assess the pattern of venous collaterals. Clinical and imaging features and outcomes were analysed using bivariate and multivariate models to assess the association of collateral patterns with the type of parenchymal lesions and clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 30 and 90\u2005days.One hundred patients were included (77 women; median age 32\u2005years; and median of 18\u2005months of follow-up). Venous collaterals were present in 88% of the patients; type I \u2026",

                "Vascular complications related to multiple hereditary exostoses are uncommon. We present a 39-year-old male patient with multiple exostoses in the upper and lower limbs with an associated positive familial history of such lesions. He experienced a sudden onset of left-side ataxia and hypoesthesia secondary to a left lateral medullary infarction, which was due to a stenotic-pattern vertebral artery dissection (V1-V4). This complication is very rare as a differential diagnosis in the vertebro-basilar dissection spectrum, and a nonspecific relation has been found.",
