                "In order to optimize the speed-control performance of the permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system with different disturbances and uncertainties, a nonlinear speed-control algorithm for the PMSM servo systems using sliding-mode control and disturbance compensation techniques is developed in this paper. First, a sliding-mode control method based on one novel sliding-mode reaching law (SMRL) is presented. This SMRL can dynamically adapt to the variations of the controlled system, which allows chattering reduction on control input while maintaining high tracking performance of the controller. Then, an extended sliding-mode disturbance observer is proposed to estimate lumped uncertainties directly, to compensate strong disturbances and achieve high servo precisions. Simulation and experimental results both show the validity of the proposed control approach.",
                "In order to optimize the current-control performance of the permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system with model parameter mismatch and one-step control delay, an improved deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) algorithm for the PMSM drive systems is proposed in this paper. First, the performance of the conventional predictive current control, when parameter mismatch exist, is analyzed, and then a stator current and disturbance observer (SCDO) based on sliding-mode exponential reaching law, which is able to simultaneously predict future value of stator current and track system disturbance caused by parameter mismatch in real time, is proposed. Based on this SCDO, prediction currents are used for replacing the sampled current in DPCC to compensate one-step delay, and estimated parameter disturbances are considered as the feedforward value to compensate the voltage reference \u2026",
                "In order to solve the parameter dependence problem in model predictive control, an improved model predictive current control (MPCC) method based on the incremental model for surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous motor drives is proposed in this paper. First, the parameter sensitivity of a conventional MPCC method is analyzed, which indicates that the parameter mismatches would cause prediction current error and inaccurate delay compensation. Therefore, an incremental prediction model is introduced in this paper to eliminate the use of permanent magnetic flux linkage in a prediction model. Among the parameter of the incremental prediction model, only inductance mismatch contributes to the prediction error, since the influence of resistance mismatch on the control performance is very small. Therefore, in order to improve the antiparameter-disturbance capability of the MPCC method, an \u2026",
                "A mechanical parameter estimation algorithm for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems based on sliding-mode observer is proposed in this paper. First, an extended sliding-mode mechanical parameter observer (ESMMPO) is presented to track system disturbances in real time, which include the information of mechanical parameters. Based on this ESMMPO, the mechanical parameter can be extracted from the estimated system disturbance. Therefore, a simple algorithm for mechanical parameter estimation of the PMSM control system is presented. The parameter choice guidelines of ESMMPO are designed to guarantee the global stability of the observer. Then, the equivalent low-pass filter function of the ESMMPO is presented to suppress the sliding-mode chattering, which allows softening the output signal of observer while maintaining no phase lag incurring. Therefore, the smooth output \u2026",
                "In order to reduce the computation burden and eliminate the weighting factor in conventional model predictive torque control (MPTC), this paper proposes an improved MPTC algorithm without the use of weighting factor. Based on the deadbeat direct torque and flux control, the reference voltage vector, which would be applied in the next period, is predicted to avoid testing all feasible voltage vectors, hence reducing the computation burden of conventional MPTC. Moreover, the torque and flux error-based cost function of conventional MPTC is replaced by the voltage vector tracking error-based cost function; thus, the weighting factor of stator flux in conventional MPTC, which is always necessary because of the different units between torque and flux, is eliminated. Furthermore, two voltage vectors, which include an active vector and a null vector, are applied during one control period to improve steady-state \u2026",
                "An extended sliding-mode observer of the load torque was proposed, of which the state variables were speed and load torque, in order to decrease influence of varying load torque in a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) control system. Errors between the real and the observed speed were selected as a sliding-mode hyper plane, and the observed load torque was composed of a real load torque and the filtered chattering signal. The observation error converged to zero when sliding mode occurred. A sliding-mode variable structure control (SMC). system of PMSM was designed based on the exponent reaching law, in which the observed load torque was used for feed-forward compensation. Experimental results show that the novel sliding-mode observer can estimate the load torque precisely, and the designed controller can enhance system robustness and suppress the intrinsic chattering of SMC.",
