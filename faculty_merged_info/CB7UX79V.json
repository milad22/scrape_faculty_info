                "Dr. Dick Greenwood Dr. Dick Greenwood BS -\u00a0Guilford College and UNCG PhD - University of South Carolina I taught and conducted research at Louisiana Tech University for 22 years and retired Professor Emeritus in Spring 2018. I did my undergraduate work at Guilford College and UNCG, majoring in History, went into the Navy, got in the Nuclear Power program, and came out of the Navy a \"physicist want-to-be\". I got a BS in Physics at UNCG and then, at the University of South Carolina, a PhD under Frank Avignone. Professor Avignone passed on to me a thirst for neutrino research that has never been quenched. Research Interests My research interests are high energy particle physics, neutrino physics and gravitational wave physics. At Louisiana Tech, I studied Weak Interactions on Run 2 at the Tevatron at Fermilab as a member of the DZero Experiment. Later I was the LaTech Team Leader on the ATLAS Experiment at CERN as the Large Hadron Collider came on line. While on ATLAS, the Higgs Boson\u00a0was detected,\u00a0a very exciting event in my life. During this\u00a0period, I centered my research on physics with Top Quarks and Tau Neutrinos. Before my collider physics work, I was the PI of the LaTech Gravitational Wave group at the LIGO Observatory in Livingston, LA. Prior to going to Louisiana Tech, I worked ten years as a Research Scientist as a member of the Reines Neutrino Group at UC-Irvine, looking for neutrino oscillations at nuclear reactor facilities around the world.
