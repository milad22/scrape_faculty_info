                "On the point that, in practices of critical thinking, we respond spontaneously in concrete situations, this paper presents an account on behalf of Wittgenstein. I argue that the \u2018seeing\u2010things\u2010aright\u2019 model of Luntley's Wittgenstein is not adequate, since it pays insufficient attention to radically new circumstances, in which the content of norms is updated. While endorsing Bailin's emphasis on criteria of critical thinking, Wittgenstein would agree with Papastephanou and Angeli's demand to look behind criteriology. He maintains the primacy of the practical, and yet contends that a reasonable person lets rules of rationality compel her. These rules are not mere heuristics. I further examine Burbules' conception of communicative reason, and, among others, his interpretation of Wittgenstein's sign\u2010post example.",
                "The forthcoming sequence of six articles is kind of an experiment. In our recent issues we published single articles only or sets of articles by different authors dealing with the same topic. As WITTGENSTEIN STUDIES are published two times a year only, this doesn't allow  to document an immediate feedback from other readers. This seems to be an unsatisfactory situation as we believe engaged(?) discussions to be an essential part of the evolution of both philosophic positions and ideas too. The opportunity to express article related positions (containing both agreement  and  disagreement) using the technique of writing letters to the editor might help a bit  here but won't solve the whole problem. Reactions like this will never look like a real discussion to the reader, as the break between thesis and antithesis takes much to long. In that case article and letter seem to be single contributions instead, although their \u2026",
                "This chapter explains the view of the later Wittgenstein, in particular his rule-following considerations and their implications for education. Many people suppose that grasping a rule amounts to getting at the right interpretation of the rule. Through the rule-following paradox, this conception is shown to be deeply misconceived. We are led back to a plain view of practices in which rules are embedded, a view that the criteria which determine the right or wrong of the use of a rule lie in the application, not in some mental entity. Meaning or the extension of a rule is settled on \u201cagreement in form of life\u201d, according to Wittgenstein. But this notion can only be appreciated when we note its dynamic nature and the role the rule-follower plays as an agent. Copyright\u00a9 2008 Cengage Learning.",

This variety of structure leads to a corresponding variety in function, leading, for example, to the amazing activities of living things. One can then speculate that the variety of structures and functions in organic molecules can be harnessed to advantage in new generations of electronic and photonic devices that find application in information technology. Indeed, physicists, chemists, and engineers can collaborate to produce designer materials for a variety of functions, and this, in fact, is the focus of work of our research group. In addition to their molecular structure and function variability, organic materials also can be formed in a number of fascinating arrangements and states of matter. Molecules can link together to form polymers, they spontaneously organize themselves into crystals and liquid crystals, and they can assemble into layers the thickness of a single molecular layer. Structure formation is also controllable. Members of our research group measure optical, electronic, and structural properties of organic electronic and photonic materials with the aim of gaining an understanding of the physical origin of optical and electronic properties, as well as the potential of particular materials for optoelectronic devices. This knowledge is then applied in collaboration with chemists to design improvements in materials. We are interested in the electronic structure of organic materials, and study features such as the range and nature of delocalized charge, as well as how molecular symmetry and dimensionality determine electronic and optical properties and the nature of elementary excitations. We also study how these materials might be used in devices, such as solar cells, lasers, displays, optical switches, image processors, and other electronic and optical devices. Much of our work is focused on nonlinear optical properties exhibited in a number of phenomena such as harmonic generation, optical control, and image processing, all resulting from the interaction of intense lasers with these materials. We are also interested in electronic transport in organic materials, and study all of these properties in polymers, liquid crystals, molecular thickness films, and in self-organizing, molecular and nanoscale composite materials. Our laboratory is equipped with the latest equipment for measuring these properties, including ultrafast Ti:Sapphire laser systems, a tunable picosecond laser, tunable nanosecond lasers, as well as associated detection and data acquisition techniques. Members of our research group, including research associates, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students master these techniques, as well as others available in our laboratory and across campus. Other facilities our group uses include nanoscale equipment including an atomic force microscope and a near-field scanning optical microscope. In addition, group members learn how to fabricate samples in the physics department\u2019s materials fabrication facility, and use associated analytical equipment. Current projects include bio-based materials for opto-electronics, nonlinear optics in organic cavity polaritons, and multilayer optical data storage."
