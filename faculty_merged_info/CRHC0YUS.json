                "On September 14, 2015 at 09: 50: 45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 \u03c3. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0\u2212 180+ 160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z= 0.0 9\u2212 0.04+ 0.03. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6\u2212 4+ 5 M\u2299 and 2 9\u2212 4+ 4 M\u2299, and the final black hole mass is 6 2\u2212 4+ 4 M\u2299, with 3. 0\u2212 0.5+ 0.5 M\u2299 c 2 \u2026",
                "On August 17, 2017 at 12\u2236 41: 04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0\u00d7 10 4 years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M\u2299, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17\u20131.60 M\u2299, with the total mass of the system 2.7 4\u2212 0.01+ 0.04 M\u2299. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg 2 (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of 4 0\u2212 14+ 8 Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet.

                "We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03: 38: 53 UTC. The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 \u03c3. The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of 3. 4\u2212 0.9+ 0.7\u00d7 10\u2212 22. The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are 14.2\u2212 3.7+ 8.3 M\u2299 and 7. 5\u2212 2.3+ 2.3 M\u2299, and the final black hole mass is 20.8\u2212 1.7+ 6.1 M\u2299.

                "We describe the observation of GW170104, a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of a pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was measured on January 4, 2017 at 10\u2236 11: 58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are 31. 2\u2212 6.0+ 8.4 M\u2299 and 19. 4\u2212 5.9+ 5.3 M\u2299(at the 90% credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, \u03c7 eff=\u2212 0.1 2\u2212 0.30+ 0.21. This result implies that spin configurations with both component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The source \u2026"
