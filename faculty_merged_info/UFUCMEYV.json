                "We have measured the inclusive b\u2192 s \u03b3 branching ratio to be (2.32\u00b10.57\u00b10.35)\u00d7 10\u2212 4, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. Upper and lower limits on the branching ratio, each at 95% CL, are B (b\u2192 s \u03b3)< 4.2\u00d7 10\u2212 4 and B (b\u2192 s \u03b3)> 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 4. These limits restrict the parameters of extensions of the standard model.",
                "The new detector for data recording by the CLEO collaboration at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring is described. This detector has been designed to optimize studying e+ e\u2212 annihilation into hadronic matter at a total energy of 10 GeV. It consists of high precesion charged particle tracking chambers and an electromagnetic calorimeter together with systems for particle identification. The design of the detector and its performance over the first year and a half of operation are presented.",
                "We report the results of a search for \u03bd e appearance in a \u03bd \u03bc beam in the MINOS long-baseline neutrino experiment. With an improved analysis and an increased exposure of 8.2\u00d7 10 20 protons on the NuMI target at Fermilab, we find that 2 sin\ufeff 2 (\u03b8 23) sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 13)< 0.12 (0.20) at 90% confidence level for \u03b4= 0 and the normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, with a best-fit of 2 sin\ufeff 2 (\u03b8 23) sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 13)= 0.041\u2212 0.031+ 0.047 (0.079\u2212 0.053+ 0.071). The \u03b8 13= 0 hypothesis is disfavored by the MINOS data at the 89% confidence level.",
                "This Letter reports results from the MINOS experiment based on its initial exposure to neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. The rates and energy spectra of charged current \u03bd \u03bc interactions are compared in two detectors located along the beam axis at distances of 1 and 735 km. With 1.27\u00d7 10 20 120 GeV protons incident on the NuMI target, 215 events with energies below 30 GeV are observed at the Far Detector, compared to an expectation of 336\u00b114 events. The data are consistent with \u03bd \u03bc disappearance via oscillations with| \u0394 m 32 2|= 2.74\u2212 0.26+ 0.44\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 and sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 23)> 0.87 (68% CL).",
                "We have observed the decays B 0\u2192 K*(892) 0 \u03b3 and B\u2212\u2192 K*(892)\u2212 \u03b3, which are evidence for the quark-level process b\u2192 s\u03b3. The average branching fraction is (4.5\u00b11.5\u00b10.9)\u00d7 10\u2212 5. This value is consistent with standard model predictions from electromagnetic penguin diagrams.",
                "This Letter reports new results from the MINOS experiment based on a two-year exposure to muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Our data are consistent with quantum-mechanical oscillations of neutrino flavor with mass splitting| \u0394 m 2|=(2.43\u00b10.13)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 (68% CL) and mixing angle sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8)> 0.90 (90% CL). Our data disfavor two alternative explanations for the disappearance of neutrinos in flight: namely, neutrino decays into lighter particles and quantum decoherence of neutrinos, at the 3.7 and 5.7 standard-deviation levels, respectively."
