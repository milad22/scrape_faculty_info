                "Fiber laser ultrasonic sensors are demonstrated to be capable of measuring acoustic emission generated by cracks in aluminum panels. A single laser sensor is integrated into a riveted lap joint, which is subject to accelerated fatigue. Acoustic emission generated by crack formation in the panel in addition to other acoustic events due to fretting within the joint are clearly resolved by the laser sensor. Localization of an acoustic emission event is demonstrated with a multiplexed array of three laser sensors. This manuscript also calculates the fundamental limit to displacement resolution of the fiber laser sensor and presents measurements of the directional response to Lamb waves. The high measurement resolution and multiplexing capability of the fiber laser ultrasonic sensor makes it an ideal candidate for structural health monitoring applications.",
                "The unique surface properties of amphiphilic molecules have made them widely used in applications where foaming, emulsifying or coating processes are needed. Novel surfactant architectures with multi-cephalic and multi-tailed molecules have reportedly enhanced their anti-bacterial activity in connection with tail length and the nature of the head group, but their ability to produce and stabilize foam is mostly unknown. Here we report on experiments with tris-cationic, triple-headed, double- and single-tailed amphiphiles and their foamability and foam stability with respect to head group, tail number and tail length. The amphiphiles are composed of an aromatic mesitylene core and three benzylic ammonium bromide groups, with alkyl chains attached to one or two of the head groups. Whereas shorter (14 carbons in length) double-tailed molecules are found to produce very stable foams, foams made with single tail \u2026",
                "We study, theoretically and experimentally, intensity noise induced by double Rayleigh scattering in long optical fibers. The results of the theoretical model are compared to experimental results performed with a high-coherence-length laser with a frequency noise spectrum that is dominated by 1\/f^\u03bd noise. Excellent quantitative agreement between theoretical and experimental RF spectra were obtained for frequencies as low as 10 Hz and for fiber lengths between 4 and 45 km. Strong low-frequency intensity noise that is induced by 1\/f^\u03bd frequency noise of the laser may limit the performance of interferometric fiber optic sensors that require high-coherence-length lasers. The intensity noise due to double Rayleigh backscattering can be suppressed by reducing the coherence length of the laser. Therefore, the intensity noise has a complex and non-monotonic dependence on the 1\/f^\u03bd frequency noise amplitude of the \u2026",
                "A distributed feedback fiber laser is shown to achieve a displacement resolution approaching 3\u00d7 10\u2212 17 m\/Hz 1\/2 up to 10 MHz (\u223c 10 3 more sensitive than the current state-of-the-art). Detection of acoustic emission events from cracks induced in fatigued lap joints is demonstrated."
