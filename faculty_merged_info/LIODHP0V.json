Azriel Genack and his research team at the Advanced Science Research Center at The Graduate Center, CUNY study microwave and optical propagation, localization and lasing in random and periodic structures, and band-edge lasing and photonics of planar and fiber chiral structures. Genack\u2019s recent research has focused on the description of wave propagation and focusing inside random media in terms of modes and transmission eigenchannels."
