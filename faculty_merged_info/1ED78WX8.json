                "Chiara  Nappi Chiara  Nappi Professor Emerita 609-258-4322 cnappi@Princeton.EDU 342 Jadwin Hall Chiara R. Nappi has been working on various aspects of theoretical particle physics, from mathematical physics to string theory. After her initial interest in constructive field theory and rigorous statistical mechanics, she worked on the skyrmion description of nucleons, at the interface of particle physics and nuclear physics. In the mid 80's she got involved in string theory, shifting her focus from particle phenomenology to string phenomenology. Among other things, she has worked on low-energy effective actions for string theory\u00a0 and investigated the effects of boundaries and higher loops corrections on the string effective actions. She also has been interested in black hole solutions, non-commutativity in string theory and integrability in string theories and gauge theories. Selected Publications  C. R.
