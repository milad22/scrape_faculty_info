                "The Swift mission, scheduled for launch in 2004, is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma\u2010ray burst (GRB) astronomy. It is a first\u2010of\u2010its\u2010kind autonomous rapid\u2010slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid\u2010reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr\u22121 and performing detailed X\u2010ray and UV\/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to  . The mission is being developed by a NASA\u2010led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new\u2010generation wide\u2010field gamma\u2010ray (15\u2013150 keV \u2026",
                "Designed as a high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatory, the Fermi Large Area Telescope is also an electron detector with a large acceptance exceeding 2 m 2 sr at 300 GeV. Building on the gamma-ray analysis, we have developed an efficient electron detection strategy which provides sufficient background rejection for measurement of the steeply falling electron spectrum up to 1 TeV. Our high precision data show that the electron spectrum falls with energy as E\u2212 3.0 and does not exhibit prominent spectral features. Interpretations in terms of a conventional diffusive model as well as a potential local extra component are briefly discussed.",
                "Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous explosions in the Universe, and their origin and mechanism are the focus of intense research and debate. More than three decades after their discovery, and after pioneering breakthroughs from space and ground experiments, their study is entering a new phase with the recently launched Swift satellite. The interplay between these observations and theoretical models of the prompt gamma-ray burst and its afterglow is reviewed.",
                "We discuss the evolution of cosmological gamma-ray burst remnants, consisting of the cooling and expanding fireball ejecta together with any swept-up external matter, after the gamma-ray event. We show that significant optical emission is predicted, which should be measurable for timescales of hours after the event, and in some cases radio emission may be expected days to weeks after the event. The flux at optical, X-ray, and other long wavelengths decays as a power of time, and the initial value of the flux or magnitude, as well as the value of the time-decay exponent, should help to distinguish between possible types of dissipative fireball models.",
                "The'event'that triggers a gamma ray burst cannot last for more than a few seconds. This is, however, long compared with the dynamical timescale of a compact stellar-mass object ( seconds). Energy is assumed to be released as an outflow with high mean lorentz factor . But a compact stellar-mass collapse or merger is, realistically, likely to generate a mass (or energy) flux that is unsteady on some timescales in the range -10 seconds. If  fluctuates by a factor of  around its mean value, relative motions within the outflowing material will themselves (in the comoving frame) be relativistic, and can give rise to internal shocks. For , the resultant dissipation occurs outside the'photosphere'and can convert a substantial fraction of the overall outflow energy into non-thermal radiation. This suggests a mechanism for cosmological bursts that demands less extreme assumptions (in respect of -values, freedom from baryonic contamination, etc) than earlier proposals.",
                "The expansion energy of a relativistic fireball can be reconverted into radiation when it interacts with an external medium. For expansion with Lorentz factors \u2273 103 into a typical galactic environment, the corresponding time-scale in the frame of the observer is of the order of seconds. This mechanism would operate in any cosmological scenario of gamma-ray bursts involving initial energies of order a per cent of a stellar rest mass, and implies photon energies and time-scales compatible with those observed in gamma-ray bursts.",
                "With the successful launch of the Swift Gamma\u2010Ray Burst Explorer, a rich trove of early X\u2010ray afterglow data has been collected by its onboard X\u2010Ray Telescope (XRT). Some interesting features are emerging, including a distinct rapidly decaying component preceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources, a shallow decay component before the more \u201cnormal\u201d decay component observed in a good fraction of GRBs, and X\u2010ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows. In this paper we systematically analyze the possible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X\u2010ray afterglow light curves and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest that the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the prompt gamma\u2010ray bursts and\/or the X\u2010ray flares. This provides strong evidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are likely two distinct components \u2026",
                "Although the link between long \u03b3-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae has been established 1, 2, 3, 4, hitherto there have been no observations of the beginning of a supernova explosion and its intimate link to a GRB. In particular, we do not know how the jet that defines a \u03b3-ray burst emerges from the star's surface, nor how a GRB progenitor explodes. Here we report observations of the relatively nearby GRB 060218 (ref. 5) and its connection to supernova SN 2006aj (ref. 6). In addition to the classical non-thermal emission, GRB 060218 shows a thermal component in its X-ray spectrum, which cools and shifts into the optical\/ultraviolet band as time passes. We interpret these features as arising from the break-out of a shock wave driven by a mildly relativistic shell into the dense wind surrounding the progenitor 7. We have caught a supernova in the act of exploding, directly observing the shock break-out, which \u2026",
                "The gamma ray burst phenomenon is reviewed from a theoretical point of view, with emphasis on the fireball shock scenario of the prompt emission and the longer wavelength afterglow. Recent progress and issues are discussed, including spectral-temporal evolution, localizations, jets, spectral lines, environmental and cosmological aspects, as well as some prospects for future experiments in both electromagnetic and nonelectromagnetic channels.",
                "The cosmological gamma-ray burst (GRB) phenomenon is reviewed. The broad observational facts and empirical phenomenological relations of the GRB prompt emission and afterglow are outlined. A well-tested, successful fireball shock model is introduced in a pedagogical manner. Several important uncertainties in the current understanding of the phenomenon are reviewed, and prospects of how future experiments and extensive observational and theoretical efforts may address these problems are discussed."
