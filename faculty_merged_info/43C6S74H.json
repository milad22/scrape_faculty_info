                "Naturalness bounds on weak scale supersymmetry in the context of radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry are analyzed. In the case of minimal supergravity it is found that for low tan \u03b2 and for low values of fine-tuning \u03a6, where \u03a6 is defined essentially by the ratio \u03bc 2\/M Z 2 where \u03bc is the Higgs mixing parameter and M Z is the Z boson mass, the allowed values of the universal scalar parameter m 0, and the universal gaugino mass m 1\/2 lie on the surface of an ellipsoid with radii fixed by \u03a6 leading to tightly constrained upper bounds\u223c \u03a6. Thus for tan \u03b2<~ 2 (<~ 5) it is found that the upper limits for the entire set of sparticle masses lie in the range< 700 GeV (< 1.5 TeV) for any reasonable range of fine-tuning (\u03a6<~ 2 0). However, it is found that there exist regions of the parameter space where the fine-tuning does not tightly constrain m 0 and m 1\/2.

                "Recently WMAP has measured the cosmological parameters to a much greater accuracy. We analyze the implications of this more precise measurement for supersymmetric dark matter and for the direct detection of supersymmetry at accelerators. We consider MSUGRA including also the hyperbolic branch (HB) in the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry. On the part of the hyperbolic branch where the lightest neutralino is dominantly a Higgsino rather than being mostly a B-ino, the relic density constraints are satisfied by coannihilation with the next lightest neutralino and the light chargino. Including this branch the lightest neutralino mass satisfies m \u03c7 1 0<~ 1200 GeV for tan \u03b2<~ 50. Constraints of b\u2192 s+ \u03b3, of g \u03bc\u2212 2, and of B s 0\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 are also analyzed. It is shown that the neutralino-proton cross section in each case will fall within the reach of dark matter experiments. The possibility for the direct \u2026",
                "A quantitative analysis of a \u03bc\u2261 1\/2 (g-2) \u03bc within the framework of supergravity grand unification and radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry is given. It is found that a \u03bc SUSY is dominated by the chiral interference term from the light chargino exchange, and that this term carries a signature which correlates strongly with the sign of \u03bc. Thus as a rule a \u03bc SUSY> 0 for \u03bc> 0 and a \u03bc SUSY< 0 for \u03bc< 0 with very few exceptions when tan\u03b2\u223c 1. At the quantitative level it is shown that if the E821 BNL experiment can reach the expected sensitivity of 4\u00d7 10\u2212 10 and there is a reduction in the hadronic error by a factor of 4 or more, then the experiment will explore a majority of the parameter space in the m 0-m g \u0303 plane in the region m 0\u2272 400 GeV, m g \u0303\u2272 700 GeV for tan\u03b2\u2273 10 assuming the experiment will not discard the standard model result within its 2\u03c3 uncertainty limit. For smaller tan\u03b2, the SUSY reach of E821 will still \u2026",
                "An analysis of supersymmetric dark matter under the Yukawa unification constraint is given. The analysis utilizes the recently discovered region of the parameter space of models with gaugino mass nonuniversalities where large negative supersymmetric corrections to the b quark mass appear to allow b\u2212 \u03c4 unification for a positive \u03bc sign consistent with the b\u2192 s+ \u03b3 and g \u03bc\u2212 2 constraints. In the present analysis we use the revised theoretical determination of a \u03bc SM [a \u03bc=(g \u03bc\u2212 2)\/2] in computing the difference a \u03bc expt\u2212 a \u03bc SM which takes into account a reevaluation of the light by light contribution, which has a positive sign. The analysis shows that the region of parameter space with nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses that allows for unification of Yukawa couplings also contains regions that allow the satisfaction of the relic density constraint. Specifically, we find that the lightest neutralino mass consistent with the \u2026",
                "We analyze the implications of the new physics effect seen in the g\u2212 2 Brookhaven measurement and show that if the effect arises from supersymmetry, then the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter \u03bc is determined to be positive in the standard sign convention. Further, analyses within the minimal supergravity model show that the Brookhaven result leads to upper limits on the universal gaugino and scalar masses of m 1\/2\u2264 800 GeV and m 0\u2264 1.5 TeV for tan \u03b2\u2264 55. Our analysis strongly suggests that supersymmetry via production of sparticles must be found at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Further, sgn (\u03bc) positive is favorable for the discovery of supersymmetric cold dark matter.",
                "We study a specific SUGRA model with nonuniversal gaugino masses as an alternative to the minimal SUGRA model in the context of supersymmetric dark matter. The lightest supersymmetric particle in this model turns out to be a Higgsino-dominated instead of a B-ino-dominated lightest neutralino. The thermal relic density of this Higgsino dark matter is somewhat lower than the cosmologically favored range, which means that it may be only a subdominant component of cold dark matter. Nonetheless, it predicts favorable rates of indirect detection, which can be seen in square-km-size neutrino telescopes.",
                "An analysis is given of the b\u2212 \u03c4 Yukawa coupling unification in view of the recent result from Brookhaven on g \u03bc\u2212 2 and under the constraint of b\u2192 s+ \u03b3. We explore b\u2212 \u03c4 unification under the above constraints for nonuniversal boundary conditions for soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. We find new regions of the parameter space where a significant negative supersymmetric contribution to the b quark mass can arise and b\u2212 \u03c4 unification within SU (5) framework can occur with nonuniversal gaugino masses. Specifically, we find that for the case where the gaugino mass matrix transforms like a 24-plet one finds a negative contribution to the b quark mass irrespective of the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter \u03bc when the supersymmetric contribution to g \u03bc\u2212 2 is positive. We exhibit regions of the parameter space where b\u2212 \u03c4 unification occurs for \u03bc> 0 satisfying the constraints of b\u2192 s+ \u03b3 and g \u03bc\u2212 2. The \u03bc< 0 case is \u2026",
                "We use the recently derived CP phase dependent analytic results for the supersymmetric electroweak correction to g \u03bc\u2212 2 to constrain the explicit CP phases in softly broken supersymmetry using the new physics effect seen in the g\u2212 2 Brookhaven measurement. It is shown that the BNL data strongly constrain the CP violating phase \u03b8 \u03bc (the phase of the Higgs mixing parameter \u03bc) and \u03be 2 [the phase of the SU (2) gaugino mass m 2] and as much as 60\u201390% of the region in the \u03be 2\u2212 \u03b8 \u03bc plane is eliminated over a significant region of the MSSM parameter space by the BNL constraint. The region of CP phases not excluded by the BNL experiment allows for large phases and for a satisfaction of the EDM constraints via the cancellation mechanism. We find several models with large CP violation which satisfy the EDM constraint via the cancellation mechanism and produce an a \u03bc SUSY consistent with the new physics \u2026",
                "A full analytic analysis of the effects of CP violating phases on the event rates in the direct detection of dark matter in the scattering of neutralinos from nuclear targets is given. The analysis includes CP violating phases in softly broken supersymmetry in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model when generational mixings are ignored. A numerical analysis shows that large CP violating phases including the constraints from the experimental limits on the neutron and the electron electric dipole moment can produce substantial effects on the event rates in dark matter detectors.",
                "The ongoing high precision E821 Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment on muon g\u2212 2 is promising to probe a theory involving supersymmetry. We have studied the constraints on the minimal anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) model using the current data of muon g\u2212 2 from Brookhaven. A scenario of seeing no deviation from the standard model is also considered, within a 2 \u03c3 limit of the combined error from the standard model result and the Brookhaven predicted uncertainty level. The resulting constraint is found to be complementary to what one obtains from b\u2192 s+ \u03b3 bounds within the AMSB scenario, since only a definite sign of \u03bc is effectively probed via b\u2192 s+ \u03b3. A few relevant generic features of the model are also described for disallowed regions of parameter space."
