Shane Hutson Curriculum Vitae Publications Epithelial Wound Healing Biomechanics of Morphogenesis Alternative approaches in toxicology Physics of UV Laser Microsurgery Mid-IR Lasers for Surgical Applications Software Seedwater Segmenter CellFIT: Cellular Force Inference Toolkit Lab Mission & Crew Teaching Shane Hutson is a Professor of Physics \u00c2\u00a0and of Biological Sciences, \u00c2\u00a0and is currently serving as Chair of the Department of Physics & Astronomy. He is also a\u00c2\u00a0Deputy Director of VIIBRE (Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystem Research & Education) and Director of VPROMPT (Vanderbilt-Pittsburgh Resource for Organotypic Models for Predictive Toxicology) .\u00c2\u00a0Professor Hutson joined the faculty at Vanderbilt University in 2003. His research interests are in biological physics \u2014 specifically in how biological systems can be probed and manipulated by light (biophotonics), in how cellular forces drive tissue morphogenesis (biomechanics), and in how embryonic development is disturbed by environmental exposures (systems biology of developmental toxicology). Current projects in the lab include: investigating the mechanisms by which cells detect nearby wounds, trigger calcium signals, and marshal wound-closure responses; using modeling and laser-microsurgery to probe the inter- and intra-cellular forces that drive morphogenesis; and using computational models and organs-on-a-chip technologies to investigate the mechanisms of developmental toxicity.
