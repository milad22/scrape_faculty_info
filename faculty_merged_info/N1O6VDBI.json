The materials possess a high sensitivity to electric fields and demonstrate sensitivity to the sign of the electric field. These suspensions will improve the performance of virtually all existing liquid crystal devices and offer the potential for entirely new applications. Also, these suspensions will serve as a model for studying and developing other liquid crystal based suspensions such as those incorporating ferromagnetic particles and carbon nanotubes. Ordered colloids: demonstrated that complex three dimensional structures of nanoparticles can be produced in liquid crystals. Preliminary research demonstrates that moving liquid crystals to an isotropic phase boundary collects, pushes, and periodically deposits nanoparticles. By adjusting a variety of conditions, such as the rate of the phase transition, the alignment of liquid crystal, the size and shape of particles, we can produce a wide variety of three dimensional structures. The application of external fields and, particularly, patterned external fields can be combined with the phase transition to produce very complex structures. This is a cutting edge research area with strong potential.
