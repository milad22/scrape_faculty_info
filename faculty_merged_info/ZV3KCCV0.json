                "This book takes a comprehensive approach to studying the process of divorce\u2014its causes and its consequences. In the research that constitutes the principal focus of the book, a group of divorced persons has been followed longitudinally and compared with a matched sample of married people followed over the same time period. The events surrounding the decision to divorce and the changes that marital dissolution brought to the divorced subjects' lives are explored. The divorced have been followed from a description of the period of estrangement in their marriages through the divorce process and on to 2\u20133 years after the divorce, or about 4 years after the couples separated.",
                "Chronic low-grade inflammation involving adipose tissue likely contributes to the metabolic consequences of obesity. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 are expressed in adipose tissue, but their role in adipose tissue inflammation during obesity is unclear.To examine the functional role of IL-33 in adipose tissues and investigate the effects on adipose tissue inflammation and obesity in vivo.We demonstrate that treatment of adipose tissue cultures in vitro with IL-33 induced production of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13, IL-10) and reduced expression of adipogenic and metabolic genes. Administration of recombinant IL-33 to genetically obese diabetic (ob\/ob) mice led to reduced adiposity, reduced fasting glucose and improved glucose and insulin tolerance. IL-33 also induced accumulation of Th2 cells in adipose tissue and polarization of adipose tissue \u2026",
                "Mandatory arrest laws, although controversial, have gained support as one mechanism for reducing domestic violence. This research examines how police officers responded to mandatory arrest statutes. Twenty-four police departments produced data on interventions in 861 cases of domestic violence. Implementing a mandatory arrest law significantly increased arrests of offenders, especially those in violation of a restraining order. Arrest was affected by injury to the victim, use of a weapon, use of alcohol, and presence of a witness. Police training was crucial to the implementation of the mandatory arrest statute.",
                "Using rapid NMR velocimetry we demonstrate the existence of shear band fluctuations in the Couette flow of the wormlike micelle system, 10% w\/v cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate (molar ratio 2\u2236 1) in 0.5 M H 2 2 O NaCl brine. We show that the fluctuations may be either quasirandom or periodic, the fluctuation spectrum being similar to that observed in the stress. Despite the equilibrium fluid being far from an isotropic-nematic transition, deuterium NMR shows that the onset of shear banding is associated with a nematic micellar state whose order parameter depends on shear rate.",
                "Using Propensity Scores in Quasi-Experimental Designs, by William M. Holmes, examines how propensity scores can be used to reduce bias with different kinds of quasi-experimental designs and to fix or improve broken experiments. Requiring minimal use of matrix and vector algebra, the book covers the causal assumptions of propensity score estimates and their many uses, linking these uses with analysis appropriate for different designs. Thorough coverage of bias assessment, propensity score estimation, and estimate improvement is provided, along with graphical and statistical methods for this process. Applications are included for analysis of variance and covariance, maximum likelihood and logistic regression, two-stage least squares, generalized linear regression, and general estimation equations. The examples use public data sets that have policy and programmatic relevance across a variety of disciplines.",
                "We describe a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique for detecting metabolism indirectly through changes in oxyhemoglobin:deoxyhemoglobin ratios and T2* signal change during \u2018oxygen challenge\u2019 (OC, 5 mins 100% O2). During OC, T2* increase reflects O2 binding to deoxyhemoglobin, which is formed when metabolizing tissues take up oxygen. Here OC has been applied to identify tissue metabolism within the ischemic brain. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in rats. In series 1 scanning (n = 5), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed, followed by echo-planar T2* acquired during OC and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI, arterial spin labeling). Oxygen challenge induced a T2* signal increase of 1.8%, 3.7%, and 0.24% in the contralateral cortex, ipsilateral cortex within the PWI\/DWI mismatch zone, and ischemic core, respectively. T2* and apparent diffusion coefficient \u2026",
                "Amino-terminal acetylation is among the most ubiquitous of protein modifications in eukaryotes. Although loss of N-terminal acetylation is associated with many abnormalities, the molecular basis of these effects is known for only a few cases, where acetylation of single factors has been linked to binding avidity or metabolic stability. In contrast, the impact of N-terminal acetylation for the majority of the proteome, and its combinatorial contributions to phenotypes, are unknown. Here, by studying the yeast prion [PSI+], an amyloid of the Sup35 protein, we show that loss of N-terminal acetylation promotes general protein misfolding, a redeployment of chaperones to these substrates, and a corresponding stress response. These proteostasis changes, combined with the decreased stability of unacetylated Sup35 amyloid, reduce the size of prion aggregates and reverse their phenotypic consequences. Thus, loss of N \u2026",
                "Using a combination of rheology and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy\/velocimetry we demonstrate the existence of shear banding fluctuations under Couette flow of the micellar system 10% w\/v cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate (CPyCl\u2013NaSal) molar ratio 2 : 1 in 0.5 M NaCl in either 1H2O or 2H2O, using both time-averaged and real-time measurements. These shear banding fluctuations are consistent not only with the shear stress fluctuations observed in rheological measurements but also with fluctuations in the change of the constrained fraction of the amphiphile chain (\u0394fc) observed in 1H-NMR spectroscopy experiments. Using 2H-NMR spectroscopy on a deuterated probe molecule (n-decane) located in the wormlike micellar interior, direct measurement of the shear-induced nematic phase transition is reported.",
                "Bullying prevention is increasingly targeting education to bystanders, but more information is needed on the complexities of bystander actions across a wide variety of incidents, including both online and in-person peer harassment. The current study analyzes victim report data from a nationally representative survey of youth ages 10\u201320 (n = 791; 51 % female). Bystander presence was common across all harassment incident types (80 % of incidents). In contrast to previous research, our study found that supportive bystander behaviors occurred at relatively high rates. Unfortunately, antagonistic bystander behaviors, although less common, were predictive of higher negative impact for the victim. A large percentage of victims (76 %) also disclosed the harassment to confidants, who play an important role as secondary bystanders. While friends were the most common confidant, incidents were also disclosed to \u2026",
                "When Robert Bardo went to the door of Rebecca S chaeffer, of the TV series My Sister Sam, and fatally shot her, the level of consciousness was raised concerning the dangers of stalkers. Several years earlier, Arthur Jackson stalked and stabbed actress Theresa Saldana. Recently, John Hinckley, Jr., shot at Ronald Reagan in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. A farmer in Canada has written scores of letters to singer, Anne Murray.Not only those in the entertainment field or politics are stalked. Husbands and wives seek out their former mates to terrorize. Unbalanced persons send letters and make phone calls to athletes and targeted strangers for purposes of terrorizing and even sexually assaulting and murder. There may be no one truly safe from a"
