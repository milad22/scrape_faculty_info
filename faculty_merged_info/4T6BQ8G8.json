                "We report the first measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry A PV in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from Pb 208. A PV is sensitive to the radius of the neutron distribution (R n). The result A PV= 0.656\u00b10.060 (stat)\u00b10.014 (syst) ppm corresponds to a difference between the radii of the neutron and proton distributions R n\u2212 R p= 0.33\u2212 0.18+ 0.16 fm and provides the first electroweak observation of the neutron skin which is expected in a heavy, neutron-rich nucleus.",
                "We report on a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in fixed target electron-electron (M\u00f8ller) scattering: A PV=[\u2212 131\u00b114 (stat)\u00b110 (syst)]\u00d7 10\u2212 9, leading to the determination of the weak mixing angle sin\ufeff 2 \u03b8 W eff= 0.2397\u00b10.0010 (stat)\u00b10.0008 (syst), evaluated at Q 2= 0.026 GeV 2. Combining this result with the measurements of sin\ufeff 2 \u03b8 W eff at the Z 0 pole, the running of the weak mixing angle is observed with over 6 \u03c3 significance. The measurement sets constraints on new physics effects at the TeV scale.",
                "We report new measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry A PV in elastic scattering of 3 GeV electrons off hydrogen and He 4 targets with\u27e8 \u03b8 lab\u27e9\u2248 6.0. The He 4 result is A PV=(+ 6.40\u00b10.23 (stat)\u00b10.12 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 6. The hydrogen result is A PV=(\u2212 1.58\u00b10.12 (stat)\u00b10.04 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 6. These results significantly improve constraints on the electric and magnetic strange form factors G E s and G M s. We extract G E s= 0.002\u00b10.014\u00b10.007 at\u27e8 Q 2\u27e9= 0.077 GeV 2, and G E s+ 0.09 G M s= 0.007\u00b10.011\u00b10.006 at\u27e8 Q 2\u27e9= 0.109 GeV 2, providing new limits on the role of strange quarks in the nucleon charge and magnetization distributions.",
                "The E885 Collaboration utilized the 1.8 GeV\/c K\u2212 beam line at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) to accumulate greater than 10 times the world\u2019s existing data sample of (K\u2212, K+) events on carbon. A total of about 3\u00d7 10 5 (K\u2212, K+) events were collected and analyzed. \u039e hypernuclear states are expected to be produced through the reaction K\u2212+ 12 C\u2192 K++ \u039e 12 Be. A signal could also result from direct production of \u039b 11 Be+ \u039b without a distinct \u039e intermediate state. The measured missing-mass spectrum indicates the existence of a signal below the threshold for free \u039e\u2212 production that cannot be explained by background or effects of limited resolution. Although the resolution was not sufficient to resolve discrete hypernuclear states, the excess of events in the region of missing mass, kinematically inaccessible in free \u039e\u2212 production, can be compared with theoretical predictions for \u039e 12 Be production \u2026",
                "We have measured the parity-violating electroweak asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from He 4 at an average scattering angle\u27e8 \u03b8 lab\u27e9= 5.7 and a four-momentum transfer Q 2= 0.091 GeV 2. From these data, for the first time, the strange electric form factor of the nucleon G E s can be isolated. The measured asymmetry of A PV=(6.72\u00b10.84 (stat)\u00b10.21 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 6 yields a value of G E s=\u2212 0.038\u00b10.042 (stat)\u00b10.010 (syst), consistent with zero.",
                "We report the most precise measurement to date of a parity-violating asymmetry in elastic electron\u2013proton scattering. The measurement was carried out with a beam energy of 3.03 GeV and a scattering angle< \u03b8 lab>= 6.0\u25cb, with the result A PV=(\u2212 1.14\u00b10.24 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 6. From this we extract, at Q 2= 0.099 GeV 2, the strange form factor combination G E s+ 0.080 G M s= 0.030\u00b10.025 (stat)\u00b10.006 (syst)\u00b10.012 (FF) where the first two errors are experimental and the last error is due to the uncertainty in the neutron electromagnetic form factor. This result significantly improves current knowledge of G E s and G M s at Q 2\u223c 0.1 GeV 2. A consistent picture emerges when several measurements at about the same Q 2 value are combined: G E s is consistent with zero while positive values are favored for G M s, though G E s= G M s= 0 is compatible with the data at 95% CL",
                "An experiment demonstrating the production of double-\u039b hypernuclei in (K\u2212, K+) reactions on 9 Be was carried out at the D6 line in the BNL alternating-gradient synchrotron. The technique was the observation of pions produced in sequential mesonic weak decay, each pion associated with one unit of strangeness change. The results indicate the production of a significant number of the double hypernucleus \u039b \u039b 4 H and the twin hypernuclei \u039b 4 H and \u039b 3 H. The relevant decay chains are discussed and a simple model of the production mechanism is presented. An implication of this experiment is that the existence of an S=\u2212 2 dibaryon more than a few MeV below the \u039b \u039b mass is unlikely.",
                "We use distorted wave electron scattering calculations to extract the weak charge form factor F W (q), the weak charge radius R W, and the point neutron radius R n of 208 Pb from the Lead Radius Experiment (PREX) parity-violating asymmetry measurement. The form factor is the Fourier transform of the weak charge density at the average momentum transfer q= 0.475 fm\u2212 1. We find F W (q)= 0.204\u00b10.028 (exp)\u00b10.001 (model). We use the Helm model to infer the weak radius from F W (q). We find R W= 5.826\u00b10.181 (exp)\u00b10.027 (model) fm. Here the experimental error includes PREX statistical and systematic errors, while the model error describes the uncertainty in R W from uncertainties in the surface thickness \u03c3 of the weak charge density. The weak radius is larger than the charge radius, implying a \u201cweak charge skin\u201d where the surface region is relatively enriched in weak charges compared to (electromagnetic \u2026",
                "The spin-orbit splitting of \u039b single-particle states in \u039b 13 C was measured. The 13 C (K\u2212, \u03c0\u2212) \u039b 13 C reaction was used to excite both the 1\/2\u2212 and 3\/2\u2212 states simultaneously, which have predominantly 12 C (0+)\u00d7 p \u039b configuration. \u03b3 rays from the states to the ground state were measured in coincidence with the \u03c0\u2212's, by which \u2113 s splitting was found to be 152\u00b154 (stat)\u00b136 (syst) keV. The value is 20\u201330 times smaller than exhibited by the \u2113 s splitting in the nuclear shell model. This value gives us new insight into the YN interaction.",
                "The Q weak experiment has measured the parity-violating asymmetry in e\u2192 p elastic scattering at Q 2= 0.025 (GeV\/c) 2, employing 145 \u03bc A of 89% longitudinally polarized electrons on a 34.4 cm long liquid hydrogen target at Jefferson Lab. The results of the experiment\u2019s commissioning run, constituting approximately 4% of the data collected in the experiment, are reported here. From these initial results, the measured asymmetry is A e p=\u2212 279\u00b135 (stat)\u00b131 (syst) ppb, which is the smallest and most precise asymmetry ever measured in e\u2192 p scattering. The small Q 2 of this experiment has made possible the first determination of the weak charge of the proton Q W p by incorporating earlier parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) data at higher Q 2 to constrain hadronic corrections. The value of Q W p obtained in this way is Q W p (PVES)= 0.064\u00b10.012, which is in good agreement with the standard model \u2026"
