He is a member of the Condensed Matter Theory group in the Department of Physics, and leads the Biocomplexity Theme at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. He directs the NASA Astrobiology Institute for Universal Biology, at UIUC.  Nigel received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1982, and for the years 1982-1985 was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California at Santa Barbara. Since 1985 he has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois, with sabbatical positions at Stanford University and the University of Cambridge. Nigel's research explores how patterns evolve in time; examples include the growth of snowflakes, the microstructures of materials, the flow of fluids, the dynamics of geological formations, and even the spatial structure of ecosystems. Nigel's interests in emergent and collective phenomena extend from condensed matter physics, where he has contributed to the modern understanding of high temperature superconductors, to biology, where his current work focuses on evolution and microbial ecology. Strongly committed to teaching, Nigel is well-known in the physics community for authoring one of the standard graduate textbooks in statistical mechanics, and is widely regarded as one of the most popular graduate-level lecturers in the Department of Physics. In 1996, Nigel took an entrepreneurial leave-of-absence to found NumeriX, the award-winning company that specializes in high-performance software for the derivatives marketplace. Amongst his awards, Nigel has been an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellow, a University Scholar of the University of Illinois, a recipient of the Xerox Award for Research, and a recipient of the A. Nordsieck Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching. He is a member of the Editorial Boards of The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance and Communications in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science. Nigel is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Yet despite their many differences, surprising similarities in the ways that they interact socially have begun to be recognized in the last few years. Now, a team of researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, building on their earlier studies, have experimentally measured the social networks of honey bees and how they develop over time. They discovered that there are detailed similarities with the social networks of humans and that these similarities are completely explained by new theoretical modeling, which adapts the tools of statistical physics for biology. The theory, confirmed in experiments, implies that there are individual differences between honey bees, just as there are between humans. In the Media In APS : 'The Uncertain Future in How a Virus Spreads' A new model by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professors Nigel Goldenfeld and Sergei Maslov helps clarify the limits of pandemic predictions, which are notoriously difficult for the near future and impossible for longer timescales. Pattern analysis of phylogenetic trees could reveal connections between evolution, ecology In biology, phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary history and diversification of species \u2013 the \u201cfamily tree\u201d of Life. Phylogenetic trees not only describe the evolution of a group of organisms but can also be constructed from the organisms within a particular environment or ecosystem, such as the human microbiome. In this way, they can describe how this ecosystem evolved and what its functional capabilities might be. Now, researchers at Illinois have presented a new analysis of the patterns generated by phylogenetic trees, suggesting that they reflect previously hypothesized connections between evolution and ecology. The study was led by Swanlund Professor of Physics Nigel Goldenfeld (BCXT leader\/GNDP), with team members graduate student Chi Xue and former undergraduate student Zhiru Liu, now at Stanford University. Their findings were published in a recent article in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , titled \u201c Scale-invariant topology and bursty branching of evolutionary trees emerge from niche construction .\u201d In the Media In APS News : Physicists rise to the COVID-19 challenge Neither Goldenfeld nor Maslov had advised policymakers before. A 63-year-old bespectacled theorist originally from the UK, Goldenfeld began his research career studying superconductors and polymers. Over more than three decades at UIUC, he had branched into computational biology to study flocking and evolutionary patterns in various ecosystems, among other research interests. Maslov, a 51-year-old Russian-American who kept his hair long even prior to the pandemic, followed a similarly interdisciplinary academic career. Skipping around from magnetic materials to financial statistics to microbial ecology, the theorist arrived at UIUC in 2015 after nearly two decades at Brookhaven National Laboratory. As members of the same research team, they frequently chatted. \u201cOur offices are right next to each other,\u201d says Maslov. Both are APS Fellows and Goldenfeld is the winner of this year's APS Leo Kadanoff Prize ."
