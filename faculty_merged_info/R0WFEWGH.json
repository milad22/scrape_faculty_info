                "A class of models for relaxation in strongly interacting glassy materials is suggested. Degrees of freedom are divided into a sequence of levels such that those in level n+ 1 are locked except when some of those in level n find the right combination to release them, this representing the hierarchy of constraints in real systems. The Kohlrausch anomalous relaxation law, exp [\u2212(t \u03c4) \u03b2], emerges naturally, and a maximum time scale is found which exhibits a Vogel-Fulcher-type temperature dependence.",
                "Intended for managers & engineers in powder technology, metal finishing & other industries using electrostatic processes, those concerned with industrial safety, flammable environments etc, & those in the electronics industry where electrostatic damage is a problem. Graduates & researchers studying electrostatics & undergraduates on courses in the subject will also find it an invaluable reference source.",
                "We present an exact solution to the problem of a random walk on an ultrametric space with arbitrary transition probabilities. The solution provides a description of fluctuation dynamics of systems with many degenerate states separated by a hierarchy of energy barriers. Dynamical behavior is found to depend on the scaling of barriers with ultrametric distance. We find a range of interesting behavior, from temperature-dependent power-law decay to the Kohlrausch law."

The research in CQP will be focused on condensed matter and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, as well as their applications to material science, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and quantum information technology. Its current members are Profs. Paul Chaikin, Andy Kent, Aditi Mitra, Javad Shabani, Tycho Sleator, Dan Stein, Andrew Wray and Jiehang Zhang. We expect the Center and its faculty to grow within the next few years.
