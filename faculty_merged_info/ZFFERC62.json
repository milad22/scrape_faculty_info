                "This paper refines the nature of the interactions between electron-deficient arenes and halide anions. Conclusions are based on (i) new crystal structures containing alkali halide salts with 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCB) and 18-crown-6, (ii) evaluation of crystal structures found in the Cambridge Structural Database, and (iii) MP2\/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations of F-, Cl-, and Br- complexes with TCB, 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene, triazine, and hexafluorobenzene. When the halide lies above the plane of the \u03c0 system, the results establish that three distinctly different types of complexes are possible:\u2009 strongly covalent \u03c3 complexes, weakly covalent donor\u2212\u03c0-acceptor complexes, and noncovalent anion\u2212\u03c0 complexes. When aryl C\u2212H groups are present, a fourth type of interaction leads to C\u2212H\u2009\u00b7\u2009\u00b7\u2009\u00b7\u2009X- hydrogen bonding. Characterization of the different geometries encountered with the four possible binding motifs provides \u2026",
                "A unique ligand design allows the formation of both an M2L3 triple helicate and an M4L6 tetrahedron (M=Ti, Ga; L=ligand based on 2,6\u2010diaminoanthracene). Although the tetrahedron is entropically disfavored, a strong host\u2013guest interaction with Me4N+ is enough to drive the equilibrium towards the tetrahedron. Remarkably, the helicate can be quantitatively converted into the tetrahedron simply by addition of Me4N+ (shown schematically).",
                "  Background . Current antibiotic therapies for Clostridium difficile\u2013associated diarrhea have limitations, including progression to severe disease, recurrent C. difficile\u2013associated diarrhea, and selection for nosocomial pathogens. Tolevamer, a soluble, high\u2013molecular weight, anionic polymer that binds C. difficile toxins A and B is a unique nonantibiotic treatment option.  Methods . In this 3-arm, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-design phase II study, patients with mild to moderately severe C. difficile\u2013associated diarrhea were randomized to receive 3 g of tolevamer per day (n = 97), 6 g of tolevamer per day (n = 95), or 500 mg of vancomycin per day (n = 97). The primary efficacy parameter was time to resolution of diarrhea, defined as the first day of 2 consecutive days when the patient had hard or formed stools (any number) or \u2a7d2 stools of \u2026",
                "A series of tripodal receptors preorganize electron-deficient aromatic rings to bind halides in organic solvents using weak \u03c3 anion-to-arene interactions or C\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X\u2212 hydrogen bonds. 1H NMR spectroscopy proves to be a powerful technique for quantifying binding in solution and determining the interaction motifs, even in cases of weak binding.",
                "Metal directed self-assembly has yielded a wide array of two- and three-dimensional structures with fascinating new chemical properties. These structures have typically been prepared utilizing transition metals as directing units, owing to the well-defined coordination preferences these metals exhibit. An area of growing research interest involves the preparation of structures containing main group elements as directing units. This tutorial review surveys the wide range of structure types available through this approach, specifically covering unique structure types accessible from the unusual coordination geometries often exhibited by the elements in Groups 12\u201317 of the periodic table. This review should be of interest to supramolecular and main group chemists, and researchers in the fields of crystal engineering, host\u2013guest chemistry, and molecular recognition.",

                "A rational approach to heterometallic cluster formation is described that uses incommensurate symmetry requirements at two different metals to control the stoichiometry of the assembly. Critical to this strategy is the proper design and synthesis of hybrid ligands with coordination sites selective toward each metal. The phosphino-catechol ligand 4-(diphenylphosphino)benzene-1,2-diol (H2L) possesses both hard catecholate and soft phosphine donor sites and serves such a role, using soft (C2-symmetric) and hard (C3-symmetric) metal centers. The ML3 catecholate complexes (M = FeIII, GaIII, TiIV, SnIV) have been prepared and characterized as C3-symmetry precursors for the stepwise assembly (aufbau) of heterometallic clusters. While the single-crystal X-ray structure of the Cs2[TiL3] salt shows a C1 mer-configuration in the solid -state, room-temperature solution NMR data of this and related complexes are \u2026",
