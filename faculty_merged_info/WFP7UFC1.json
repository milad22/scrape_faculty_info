                "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly available its First Data Release. This consists of 2099 deg 2 of five-band (u, g, r, i, z) imaging data, 186,240 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 1360 deg 2 of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data go to a depth of r\u2248 22.6 and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The spectra cover the range 3800\u20139200 \u00c5, with a resolution of 1800\u20132100. This paper describes the characteristics of the data with emphasis on improvements since the release of commissioning data (the SDSS Early Data Release) and serves as a pointer to extensive published and on-line documentation of the survey.",
                "The ionizing background determines the ionization balance and the thermodynamics of the cosmic gas. It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to theoretical and empirical studies of both the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxy formation. We present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model, star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the H I ionizing field at z< 3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of re-emitted \u2026",
                "It is possible that the properties of H ii regions during reionization depend sensitively on many poorly constrained quantities [the nature of the ionizing sources, the clumpiness of the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM), the degree to which photoionizing feedback suppresses the abundance of low-mass galaxies, etc.], making it extremely difficult to interpret upcoming observations of this epoch. We demonstrate that the actual situation is more encouraging, using a suite of radiative transfer simulations, post-processed on outputs from a 10243, 94-Mpc N-body simulation. Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale structures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body simulation. We show that the morphology of the H ii regions for reionization by POPII-like stars is most dependent on the global ionization fraction. Changing other parameters by an order of magnitude for fixed often results \u2026",
                "We present results from a large volume simulation of hydrogen reionization. We combine 3D radiative transfer calculations and an N\u2010body simulation, describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the growth of H ii regions around high\u2010redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks 10243 dark matter particles, in a box of comoving side length  . This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of H ii regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: H ii regions grow collectively around highly clustered sources and have a well\u2010defined characteristic size, which evolves from a sub\u2010Mpc scale at the beginning of reionization to   Mpc toward the end. We present a detailed statistical description of our results and compare \u2026",
                "Observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) suggest that quasars reionize He II in the IGM at z\u2248 3. We have run a set of 190 and 430 comoving Mpc simulations of He II being reionized by quasars to develop an understanding of the nature of He II reionization and its potential impact on observables. We find that He II reionization heats regions in the IGM by as much as 25, 000 K above the temperature that is expected otherwise, with the volume-averaged temperature increasing by~ 12, 000 K and with large temperature fluctuations on~ 50 Mpc scales. Much of this heating occurs far from quasars by photons with long mean free path. We find a temperature-density equation of state of \u03b3\u20131\u2248 0.3 during He II reionization, but with a wide dispersion in this relation having \u03c3 T~ 10 4 K. He II reionization by the observed population of quasars cannot produce an inverted relation (\u03b3\u20131< 0). Our simulations are consistent \u2026",
                "We investigate the implications of the intergalactic opacity for the evolution of the cosmic UV luminosity density and its sources. Our main constraint is our measurement of the Ly\u03b1 forest opacity at redshifts   from 86 high\u2010resolution quasar spectra. In addition, we impose the requirements that H i must be reionized by   and He ii by   and consider estimates of the hardness of the ionizing background from H i\u2013to\u2013He ii column density ratios. The derived hydrogen photoionization rate is remarkably flat over the Ly\u03b1 forest redshift range covered. Because the quasar luminosity function is strongly peaked near  , the lack of redshift evolution indicates that star\u2010forming galaxies likely dominate the photoionization rate at  . Combined with direct measurements of the galaxy UV luminosity function, this requires only a small fraction   of galactic hydrogen\u2010ionizing photons to escape their source for galaxies to solely account for the \u2026",
                " We measure the evolution of the intergalactic Ly\u03b1 effective optical depth,  , over the redshift range   from a sample of 86 high\u2010resolution, high\u2010S\/N quasar spectra obtained with the ESI and HIRES spectrographs on Keck and with the MIKE spectrograph on Magellan. This represents an improvement over previous analyses of the Ly\u03b1 forest from high\u2010resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of 2 in the size of the data set alone. We pay particular attention to robust error estimation and extensively test for systematic effects. We find that our estimates of the quasar continuum levels in the Ly\u03b1 forest obtained by spline fitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the bias increasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mock spectra. The mean fractional error   is <1% at  , 4% at  , and 12% at  . Previous measurements of   at   based on directly fitting the quasar continua in the Ly\u03b1 \u2026",
                "We calculate the impact of the intergalactic medium (IGM) on the observed Ly\u03b1 lines emitted by galaxies in an ionized IGM at z\u2265 4. Our model accounts for gas clumping in the IGM and for the fact that high-redshift galaxies reside in overdense regions, which causes the velocity field of the IGM to depart from the Hubble flow. The observed shape of the Ly\u03b1 line varies widely, with dependence on the intrinsic width and systemic velocity of the line, a galaxies star formation rate and the local extragalactic UV background. For large star formation rates and levels of the UV background, absorption in the IGM does not result in a Ly\u03b1 line that is asymmetric as is common among known high-redshift Ly\u03b1 emitters (LAEs). For models in which the lines do show the observed strong asymmetry, the IGM typically transmits only 10\u201330 per cent of the Ly\u03b1 flux. The increase in the ionizing background that accompanied the \u2026",
                "We forecast the sensitivity with which the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can measure the 21 cm power spectrum of cosmic hydrogen. The MWA is sensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of  \u20131 h Mpc\u22121). This amounts primarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift evolution in these quantities can yield important information about reionization. We examine a range of theoretical models, spanning uncertainties in the nature of the ionizing sources and the abundance of minihalos during reionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially among these models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales (  h Mpc\u22121) peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM) is \u224850% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power \u2026",
                "The epoch of reionization is a milestone of cosmological structure formation, marking the birth of the first objects massive enough to yield large numbers of ionizing photons. However, the mechanism and timescale of reionization remain largely unknown. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) Doppler effect from ionizing bubbles embedded in large-scale velocity streams\u2014known as the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect\u2014can be used to constrain the duration of reionization. When combined with large-scale CMB polarization measurements, the evolution of the ionized fraction, , can be inferred. Using new multi-frequency data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT), we show that the ionized fraction evolved relatively rapidly. For our basic foreground model, we find the kSZ power sourced by reionization at \u2113= 3000 to be D patchy 3000\u2264 2.1 \u03bcK 2 at 95% confidence. Using reionization \u2026"
