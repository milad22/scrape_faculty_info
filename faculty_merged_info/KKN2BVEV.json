                "We investigate the properties of chiral operators in N = 2 superconformal theories. In particular, we study the spectral flow of such models under a one-parameter family of twists generated by the U(1) current, and use this to deduce various properties of the ring of chiral primary fields. We furthermore investigate under what conditions a given superconformal theory can be represented as the fixed point of an N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg theory and show how to determine the superpotential. We also investigate the coset models of Kazama and Suzuki and find a simple cohomological characterization for the elements of the chiral primary ring. Moreover we show how some of them can be represented as LG models.",
                "We obtain first order equations that determine a supersymmetric kink solution in five-dimensional N= 8 gauged supergravity. The kink interpolates between an exterior anti-de Sitter region with maximal supersymmetry and an interior anti-de Sitter region with one quarter of the maximal supersymmetry. One eighth of supersymmetry is preserved by the kink as a whole. We interpret it as describing the renormalization group flow in N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory broken to an N= 1 theory by the addition of a mass term for one of the three adjoint chiral superfields. A detailed correspondence is obtained between fields of bulk supergravity in the interior anti-de Sitter region and composite operators of the infrared field theory. We also point out that the truncation used to find the reduced symmetry critical point can be extended to obtain a new N= 4 gauged supergravity theory holographically dual to a sector of N= 2 gauge theories based on quiver diagrams.We consider more general kink geometries and construct a c-function that is positive and monotonic if a weak energy condition holds in the bulk gravity theory. For even-dimensional boundaries, the c-function coincides with the trace anomaly coefficients of the holographically related field theory in limits where conformal invariance is recovered.",
                "Using ideas from renormalization group theory we show that the study of catastrophes (singularities) is a powerful tool in the classification of conformal theories. The results are most powerful when applied to N=2 superconformal models. The ideas are illustrated by considering some examples including the minimal superconformal models.",
                "We show how the Riemann surface \u03c3 of N= 2 Yang-Mills field theory arises in type II string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The relevant local geometry is given by fibrations of ALE spaces. The 3-branes that give rise to BPS multiplets in the string descend to self-dual strings on the Riemann surface, with tension determined by a canonically fixed Seiberg-Witten differential \u03bb. This gives, effectively, a dual formulation of Yang-Mills theory in which gauge bosons and monopoles are treated on equal footing, and represents the rigid analog of type II\/heterotic string duality. The existence of BPS states is essentially reduced to a geodesic problem on the Riemann surface with metric| \u03bb| 2. This allows us, in particular, to easily determine the spectrum of stable BPS states in field theory. Moreover, we identify the six-dimensional space R 4\u00d7 \u03c3 as the world-volume of a five-brane and show that BPS states correspond \u2026",
                "After the work of Seiberg and Witten, it has been seen that the dynamics of N = 2 Yang-Mills theory is governed by a Riemann surface \u03f5 In particular, the integral of a special differential \u03c9SW over (a subset of) the periods of \u03f5 gives the mass formula for BPS-saturated states. We show that, for each simple group G, the Riemann surface is a spectral curve of the periodic Toda lattice for the dual group, GV whose affine Dynkin diagram is the dual of that of G. This curve is not unique, rather it depends on the choice of a representation \u03f1 of GV; however, different choices of \u03f1 lead to equivalent constructions. The Seiberg-Witten differential \u03c9SW is naturally expressed in Toda variables, and the N = 2Yang-Mills pre-potential is the free energy of a topological field theory defined by the data \u03b5g, \u03c0 and \u03c9SW.",
                "In this review article, we describe some of the recent progress towards the construction and analysis of three-charge configurations in string theory and supergravity. We begin by describing the Born-Infeld construction of three-charge supertubes with two dipole charges and then discuss the general method of constructing three-charge solutions in five dimensions. We explain in detail the use of these methods to construct black rings, black holes, as well as smooth microstate geometries with black hole and black ring charges, but with no horizon. We present arguments that many of these microstate geometries are dual to boundary states that belong to the same sector of the D1-D5-P CFT as the typical states. We end with an extended discussion of the implications of this work for the physics of black holes in string theory.",
                "We construct all 11-dimensional, three-charge BPS solutions that preserve a fixed, standard set of supersymmetries. Our solutions include all BPS three-charge rotating black holes, black rings, supertubes, as well as arbitrary superpositions of these objects. We find very large families of black rings and supertubes with profiles that follow arbitrary closed curves in the spatial  transverse to the branes. The black rings copiously violate black-hole uniqueness. The supertube solutions are completely regular and generically have small curvature. They also have the same asymptotics as the three-charge black hole; so they might be mapped to microstates of the D1\u2013D5\u2013p system and used to explain the entropy of this black hole.",
                "Using ideas of renormalization group flows we show how to represent a large class of Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of renormalization group fixed points of Landau-Ginzburg models. In particular we show why Gepner's construction yields Calabi-Yau compactifications. More precisely, we show that all of his models correspond to strings propagating on algebraic varieties in weighted projective spaces.",
                "States on the Coulomb branch of Script N= 4 super-Yang-Mills theory are studied from the point of view of gauged supergravity in five dimensions. These supersymmetric solutions provide examples of consistent truncation from type-IIB supergravity in ten dimensions. A mass gap for states created by local operators and perfect screening for external quarks arise in the supergravity approximation. We offer an interpretation of these surprising features in terms of ensembles of brane distributions.",
                "We give a detailed construction of gauged N = 8 supergravity theories in five dimensions with Yang-Mills gauge groups SO(p, 6\u2212p)(p=0, 1, 2, 3), physical global symmetry SU(1, 1), and local composite symmetry USp(8). The scalar potentials are studied and several critical points are found for the SO(6) and SO(3,3) theories. Those of the SO(6) theory are related to compactifications of the chiral N = 2 theory in ten dimensions. We discuss truncations of the SO(6) theory and give an independent discussion of the relevant N = 2,4,6 and 8 anti-de Sitter supermultiplets."
