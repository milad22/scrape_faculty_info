                "The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment has measured a nonzero value for the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations. Antineutrinos from six 2.9 G W th reactors were detected in six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (flux-weighted baseline 470 m and 576 m) and one far (1648 m) underground experimental halls. With a 43 000 ton\u2013G W th\u2013day live-time exposure in 55 days, 10 416 (80 376) electron-antineutrino candidates were detected at the far hall (near halls). The ratio of the observed to expected number of antineutrinos at the far hall is R= 0.940\u00b10.011 (stat.)\u00b10.004 (syst.). A rate-only analysis finds sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.092\u00b10.016 (stat.)\u00b10.005 (syst.) in a three-neutrino framework.",
                "We report the observation of a narrow charmoniumlike state produced in the exclusive decay process B\u00b1\u2192 K\u00b1\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8. This state, which decays into \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8, has a mass of 3872.0\u00b10.6 (s t a t)\u00b10.5 (s y s t) M e V, a value that is very near the M D 0+ M D* 0 mass threshold. The results are based on an analysis of 152M B-B events collected at the \u03a5 (4 S) resonance in the Belle detector at the KEKB collider. The signal has a statistical significance that is in excess of 10 \u03c3.",
                "The Belle detector was designed and constructed to carry out quantitative studies of rare B-meson decay modes with very small branching fractions using an asymmetric e+ e\u2212 collider operating at the \u03d2 (4S) resonance, the KEK-B-factory. Such studies require data samples containing\u223c 10 7 B-meson decays. The Belle detector is configured around a 1.5 T superconducting solenoid and iron structure surrounding the KEK-B beams at the Tsukuba interaction region. B-meson decay vertices are measured by a silicon vertex detector situated just outside of a cylindrical beryllium beam pipe. Charged particle tracking is performed by a wire drift chamber (CDC). Particle identification is provided by dE\/dx measurements in CDC, aerogel threshold Cherenkov counter and time-of-flight counter placed radially outside of CDC. Electromagnetic showers are detected in an array of CsI (Tl) crystals located inside the solenoid coil \u2026",
                "We present a measurement of the standard model CP violation parameter sin 2 \u03c6 1 based on a 29.1 fb\u2212 1 data sample collected at the \u03d2 (4 S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212 collider. One neutral B meson is fully reconstructed as a J\/\u03c8 K S, \u03c8 (2 S) K S, \u03c7 c 1 K S, \u03b7 c K S, J\/\u03c8 K L, or J\/\u03c8 K* 0 decay and the flavor of the accompanying B meson is identified from its decay products. From the asymmetry in the distribution of the time intervals between the two B meson decay points, we determine sin 2 \u03c6 1= 0.99\u00b10.14 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst). We conclude that we have observed CP violation in the neutral B meson system.",
                "An experiment has been performed to search for the muon-and electron-number nonconserving decay \u03bc+\u2192 e+ \u03b3. The upper limit for the branching ratio is found to be \u0393 (\u03bc+\u2192 e+ \u03b3)\/\u0393 (\u03bc+\u2192 e+ \u03bd \u03bd)< 1.2\u00d7 10\u2212 11 with 90% confidence.",
                "The cross section for e+ e\u2212\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 between 3.8 and 5.5 GeV is measured with a 967 fb\u2212 1 data sample collected by the Belle detector at or near the \u03a5 (n S)(n= 1, 2,\u2026, 5) resonances. The Y (4260) state is observed, and its resonance parameters are determined. In addition, an excess of \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 production around 4 GeV is observed. This feature can be described by a Breit-Wigner parametrization with properties that are consistent with the Y (4008) state that was previously reported by Belle. In a study of Y (4260)\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 decays, a structure is observed in the M (\u03c0\u00b1J\/\u03c8) mass spectrum with 5.2 \u03c3 significance, with mass M=(3894.5\u00b16.6\u00b14.5) MeV\/c 2 and width \u0393=(63\u00b124\u00b126) MeV\/c 2, where the errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. This structure can be interpreted as a new charged charmoniumlike state.",
                "A distinct peak is observed in the \u03c0\u00b1\u03c8\u2032 invariant mass distribution near 4.43 GeV in B\u2192 K \u03c0\u00b1\u03c8\u2032 decays. A fit using a Breit-Wigner resonance shape yields a peak mass and width of M= 4433\u00b14 (stat)\u00b12 (syst) MeV and \u0393= 45\u2212 13+ 18 (stat)\u2212 13+ 30 (syst) MeV. The product branching fraction is determined to be B (B 0\u2192 K\u2213 Z\u00b1(4430))\u00d7 B (Z\u00b1(4430)\u2192 \u03c0\u00b1\u03c8\u2032)=(4.1\u00b11.0 (stat)\u00b11.4 (syst))\u00d7 10\u2212 5, where Z\u00b1(4430) is used to denote the observed structure. The statistical significance of the observed peak is 6.5 \u03c3. These results are obtained from a 605 fb\u2212 1 data sample that contains 657\u00d7 10 6 B B pairs collected near the \u03a5 (4 S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+ e\u2212 collider.",
                "We report a measurement of the branching fraction ratios R (D (*)) of B\u2192 D (*) \u03c4\u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 relative to B\u2192 D (*) \u2113\u2212 \u03bd \u2113 (where \u2113= e or \u03bc) using the full Belle data sample of 772\u00d7 10 6 B B pairs collected at the \u03d2 (4 S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212 collider. The measured values are R (D)= 0.375\u00b10.064 (stat)\u00b10.026 (syst) and R (D*)= 0.293\u00b10.038 (stat)\u00b10.015 (syst). The analysis uses hadronic reconstruction of the tag-side B meson and purely leptonic \u03c4 decays. The results are consistent with earlier measurements and do not show a significant deviation from the standard model prediction.",
                "We report the observation of two narrow structures in the mass spectra of the \u03c0\u00b1\u03a5 (n S)(n= 1, 2, 3) and \u03c0\u00b1h b (m P)(m= 1, 2) pairs that are produced in association with a single charged pion in \u03a5 (5 S) decays. The measured masses and widths of the two structures averaged over the five final states are M 1=(10 607.2\u00b12.0) MeV\/c 2, \u0393 1=(18.4\u00b12.4) MeV, and M 2=(10 652.2\u00b11.5) MeV\/c 2, \u0393 2=(11.5\u00b12.2) MeV. The results are obtained with a 121.4 fb\u2212 1 data sample collected with the Belle detector in the vicinity of the \u03a5 (5 S) resonance at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212 collider.",
                "The cross section for e+ e\u2212\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J\/\u03c8 between 3.8 and 5.5 GeV\/c 2 is measured using a 548 fb\u2212 1 data sample collected on or near the \u03a5 (4 S) resonance with the Belle detector at KEKB. A peak near 4.25 GeV\/c 2, corresponding to the so called Y (4260), is observed. In addition, there is another cluster of events at around 4.05 GeV\/c 2. A fit using two interfering Breit-Wigner shapes describes the data better than one that uses only the Y (4260), especially for the lower-mass side of the 4.25 GeV enhancement."
