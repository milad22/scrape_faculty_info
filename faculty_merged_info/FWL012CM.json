Our interests are in the structure and dynamics of \"interesting systems,\" broadly defined. We seek \n      to understand how materials ranging from quantum crystals to semiconductors to proteins are put together and how their \n      time-dependent behavior can be elucidated and exploited. Spectroscopic studies are at the heart of these problems and we use and invent techniques and detection methods as \n      needed. Optical spectroscopy including Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and laser-based optoacoustic techniques, and \n      SQUID technologies are but a few examples. We have used these and other techniques to study trace pollutant gases in \n      the Earth's atmosphere, doped inorganic crystals, amorphous silicon, solid hydrogen, fullerenes, and nanoscale magnetic \n      materials. Temperature dependent measurements are often vital to our needs and we have extensive capabilities in \n      cryogenics. We also have a strong interest in the development of new laser systems.
