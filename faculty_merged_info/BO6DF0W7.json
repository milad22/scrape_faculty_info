Berkeley Fields of Study: My research centers on the search for new physics at high energies, using data from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\u00a0 \u00a0My work has included searches\u00a0 for a new class of particles called \"vector-like quarks\" whose existence could explain some of the odd features of our current theories of fundamental particle physics, and my present focus is on measuring the cross section for the production of four top quarks in a single proton-proton collision, a process that has not yet been observed.\u00a0 I am also involved in the development of electronics for a track-based trigger system that will help to cope with the data rates when the LHC is upgraded to run at much higher intensity in the coming years.
