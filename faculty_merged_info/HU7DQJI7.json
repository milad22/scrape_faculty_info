My research focuses on searching for signs of new physics, beyond what is currently known and encapsulated\u00a0in the Standard Model. Additionally, I am working on the design and construction of a new calorimeter for the next upgrade of the CMS experiment ahead of the High Luminosity LHC. This calorimeter will be able to take 3D images with excellent\u00a0timing resolution, and will enable us to reconstruct particle showers with a precision that is unprecedented. Specifically, my group is developing readout electronics that take data from silicon sensors, concentrate it, and send it to the off-detector electronics for further processing."
