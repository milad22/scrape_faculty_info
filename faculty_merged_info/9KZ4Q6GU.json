                "We demonstrate an ultrastable CO 2 laser trap that provides tight confinement of neutral atoms with negligible optical scattering and minimal laser-noise-induced heating. Using this method, fermionic 6 Li atoms are stored in a 0.4 mK deep well with a 1\/e trap lifetime of 300 sec, consistent with a background pressure of 10\u2212 11 Torr. To our knowledge, this is the longest storage time ever achieved with an all-optical trap, comparable to the best reported magnetic traps.",
                "We derive a simple formula for the heating rate that arises from quantum-diffractive background gas collisions in atom traps. This result appears to explain the residual heating rates reported for recent experiments with a Cs vapor-loaded, far-detuned optical trap at\u2243 10\u2212 9 Torr [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5768 (1998)]. Diffractive collisions may determine the minimum heating rates achievable in shallow all-optical or magnetic atom traps operating at low temperature and high density.",
                "We use an all-optical trap to confine a strongly attractive two-state mixture of lithium fermions. By measuring the rate of evaporation from the trap, we determine the effective elastic scattering cross section 4 \u03c0 a 2 to show that the magnitude of the scattering length| a| is very large, in agreement with predictions. We show that the mixture is stable against inelastic decay provided that a small bias magnetic field is applied. For this system, the s-wave interaction is widely tunable at low magnetic field, and can be turned on and off rapidly via a Raman \u03c0 pulse. Hence, this mixture is well suited for fundamental studies of an interacting Fermi gas.",
                "We present measurements of the intensity dependence of excited-state collisions of laser-cooled 85 Rb atoms involving repulsive excited-state potentials. For high intensities, the collision rate decreases with increasing intensity, in accordance with a simple Landau-Zener treatment of the collision dynamics.",
                "We observe squeezing in the phase-dependent fluorescence spectra of two-level atoms that are coherently driven by a near-resonant laser field in free space. In contrast to previous predictions that emphasized the in-and out-of-phase quadratures, we find that maximum squeezing occurs for homodyne detection at a phase near\u00b145\u2218 relative to the exciting field. A new physical picture of phase-dependent noise is developed that incorporates quantum collapses into a Bloch vector model and yields a very simple form for the complete squeezing spectrum.",
                "We report measurements of the intensity correlations of scattered light from atoms in optical molasses. For small numbers of atoms, the observations are consistent with recent models of the Rayleigh and Raman contributions to the frequency spectrum. Magnetic fields on the order of 100 mG significantly broaden the spectrum. Radiation trapping results in reduction of the size of the correlations as well as broadening of the spectrum.\u00a9 1996 The American Physical Society.",
                "We measure the depth of an optical atom trap using repulsive trap-loss collisions. These collisions involve excitation by a laser tuned to a frequency above the atomic resonance. Simple conservation of energy considerations give direct quantitative measurements of the trap depth. Further analysis allows measurement of the escape probability as a function of energy. We apply the methods to Rb traps, and use the results to form conclusions about ground-state hyperfine-changing collisions.",
                "We demonstrate a two-window heterodyne method for measuring the x\u2013p cross correlation, E^*xEp, of an optical field E for transverse position x and transverse momentum p. This scheme permits independent control of the x and p resolution. A simple linear transform of the x\u2013p correlation function yields the Wigner phase-space distribution. This technique is useful for both coherent and low-coherence light sources and may permit new biological imaging techniques based on transverse coherence measurement with time gating. We point out an interesting analogy between x\u2013p correlation measurements for classical-wave and quantum fields.",
                "We demonstrate a first simultaneous measurement of the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index of a highly turbid medium by observing the real-time reflectance profile of a divergent laser beam made incident on the surface of the turbid medium. We find that the reflectance data are well described by Fresnel theory that correctly includes the effect on total internal reflection of angle-dependent penetration into the turbid medium.",
                "We present a refractometer based on the principle of total internal reflection that can sensitively record, in real time, the refractive index of fluids over a wide range of refractive indices. The device uses a divergent laser beam and a linear diode array, and has no mechanical or optical moving parts, enabling us to achieve the measurement of a refractive index at a sensitivity level of 10\u22126. Our refractometer does not rely on interferometry, thus enabling the device to be compact, portable, and inexpensive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a noninterferometric device that performs real-time differential refractometry with a sensitivity of better than 10\u22125 has been demonstrated in the literature. We show that our experimental results agree very well with Fresnel theory. We establish a theoretical limit on the sensitivity of this class of refractometers."

My research area is experimental quantum optics and optical physics, including novel optical sensing methods. In our labs we have three principal directions of research: We investigate the dynamics of ultracold atoms confined in an \u201coptical lattice\u201d, for applications in nanolithography and quantum computing. An \u201coptical lattice\u201d consists of atoms at temperatures of few microKelvins organized in crystal-like fashion in periodic potential wells induced by the interference of several laser beams. The depth, shape, and spacing of the wells can be adjusted by varying laser intensity, polarization, and frequency. We investigate the phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency and electromagnetically induced absorption in atomic vapors, for application in the \u201cslowing\u201d and storage of light inside an atomic medium, and sensitive magnetometry. We investigate novel optical sensing methods in turbid media (i.e., non-transparent, highly scattering media such as milk, animal tissue, petroleum products) for bio\/environmental applications. I am a faculty member of the Macklin Quantum Information Sciences ( MQuIS ) Group at Miami. MQuIS is a node (member) of the internationally renowned Southwestern Quantum Information and Technology ( SQuInT ) network. In my plentiful free time, I enjoy playing cricket\/baseball\/table tennis\/racquetball\/badminton with my daughter and son, and volleyball with my students."
