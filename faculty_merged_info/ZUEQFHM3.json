                "Olga  Evdokimov, PhD Professor and Director of Graduate Studies 2264 SES (312) 996-3413 evdolga@uic.edu CV Download: Evdokimov_CV_2020_short Olga Evdokimov personal page Olga Evdokimov is a Professor of Physics and Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois \u2013 Chicago. She received her PhD in 1999 from Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) and Ivanovo State University (Ivanovo, Russia). Her research is focused on the experimental exploration of phases of nuclear matter. She is involved with two experimental programs with the STAR (Solenoid Tracker at RHIC) detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), studying the properties of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). Her research interests span a variety of subjects, and include investigating the collision dynamics, hadronization mechanisms in QGP, statistical jet reconstruction and jet-medium interactions. In 2016 she was elected as a Chair of the STAR Collaboration Council, and is currently serving in this position. She is also serving as a member of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee to the US Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.
