                "Precision Agriculture (PA) can help in managing crop production inputs in an environmentally friendly way. By using site-specific knowledge, PA can target rates of fertilizer, seed and chemicals for soil and other conditions. PA substitutes information and knowledge for physical inputs. A literature review indicates PA can contribute in many ways to long-term sustainability of production agriculture, confirming the intuitive idea that PA should reduce environmental loading by applying fertilizers and pesticides only where they are needed, and when they are needed. Precision agriculture benefits to the environment come from more targeted use of inputs that reduce losses from excess applications and from reduction of losses due to nutrient imbalances, weed escapes, insect damage, etc. Other benefits include a reduction in pesticide resistance development. One limitation of the papers reviewed is that only a \u2026",
                "Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is the most economically important indigenous African legume crop. Production, marketing and trade information on cowpea are necessary to promote trade, and guide research and policy. Using data from the FAO, national statistics and the Bean\/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP), this paper consolidates information on cowpea production, marketing and trade in West and Central Africa and examines the effects of grain characteristics on prices.In the 1990s, West and Central Africa annually produced about 2.6 million tonnes of cowpea on 7.8 million hectares, accounting for 69% of the world\u2019s production and 80% of area. Niger, Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Cameroon, Chad and Senegal are net exporters; Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Mauritania are net importers. Official sources show at least 285,000 t of cowpeas were shipped between \u2026",
                "Site\u2010specific farming (SSF) practices are being adopted at an accelerating rate, but evidence of their profitability has been mixed or missing. This contribution evaluates the profitability of SSF practices by synthesizing quantitative and qualitative research results within the context of the economics of information technology. The profitability results from nine published field research studies on variable rate (VR) fertilizer application are reviewed using partial budgets adjusted to include minimum costs and grid cell areas for each study. Profitability results correlated closely with the gross revenue earning potential of the crop, so VR fertilizer application was unprofitable on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), sometimes profitable on corn (Zea mays L.), and profitable on sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris subsp. L. vulgaris). Although the formal published literature has ignored the profitability of yield \u2026",
                "The economics of site\u2010specific management (SSM) of agronomic crops is a rapidly moving target. This chapter reviews knowledge on the economics of SSM. SSM expands potential to adjust the spatial resolution for the characteristics of the decision made. The chapter identifies unanswered questions for field and farm level economic research on SSM. The profitability of any SSM technology is site specific and must be determined on a farm\u2010by\u2010farm or field\u2010by\u2010field basis. The history of technological change in agriculture teaches that most of the profits will go to the early adopters who get both the technology and the management right. The extensive literature on factors affecting the adoption of new agricultural production technology can be boiled down to two factors: willingness and ability to adopt. Site\u2010specific fertilization will refer to grid soil sampling, sample analysis, map making, and variable rate \u2026",
                "Two mail surveys were carried out in Denmark and the Eastern Corn Belt, USA in 2002. Questionnaires were sent to 580 farmers who had used precision agriculture (PA) and 198 responses were received. The surveys focused on the current status of use of PA in both countries, including: PA practices, equipment and software, Internet and e-mail use, information sources for PA, satisfaction level from service providers, data handling, interpretation, storage and ownership, value of data for decision making, changes in management practices, desired information and services, and the next planned step in the practice of PA. The survey results showed more similarities in practicing PA between the two countries than differences. Time requirement and high cost of data handling were cited as the main problems. Survey respondents found soil maps to be more valuable than yield maps in management decisions \u2026",
                "Site-specific management is intuitively appealing to many producers and agribusiness people, but intuitively appealing ideas are not always profitable. The objective of this report is to summarize and organize the publicly available studies of the profitability of precision agriculture.",
                "Consumer preference information is essential to targeting research. This paper reports an effort of a multi\u2010disciplinary team to measure the market value of cowpea characteristics. Five samples were purchased once per month in seven markets in Ghana and Cameroon starting in September 1996. In the market, price and vendor characteristics were noted. In the laboratory, size of grains, testa color, testa texture, eye color and damage levels were recorded. A hedonic pricing regression model was used. Results indicate that grain size is the most important characteristic. Consumers seem more sensitive to bruchid (Callosobruchus maculates) damage than hypothesized. Cowpeas with white testa command a clear premium only in one of the Ghanaian markets. In Ghana, black eyes sell at a premium, but in Cameroon black eyes are discounted. In general, this study indicates that quality characteristics are very \u2026"

He has since\u00a0been a Post-Doctoral researcher with the Joint Institute of Nuclear Astrophysics at the University of Notre Dame. In 2014 he was also a visiting researcher at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy and has returned several times for experimental collaborations and to give lectures. Dr. deBoer\u2019s research interests center around the determination of the nuclear reaction rates of light nuclei that are important for understanding how energy is produced and how the elements are created in stars. His main interest is in closely linking nuclear reaction theory to experimental measurements to make the interpretation of nuclear data, and the uncertainties of the data, more straightforward. Following these lines of research, he has published several research papers reporting on experimental measurements made using the University of Notre Dame\u2019s experimental facilities and interpreted the results using R-matrix reaction theory. In 2016 he was the co-organizer of the R-matrix workshop on applications and methods, which was sponsored by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics, Los Alamos National Laboratories, and the Institute for Nuclear and Particle Physics at Ohio University. He currently serves as a consultant for the International Atomic Energy Agency for the evaluation of charged-particle induced reactions in the resolved-resonance region. Recent publications D.W.
