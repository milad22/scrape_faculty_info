                "Dr. Dorival Gon\u00e7alves Assistant Professor Ph.D., Heidelberg University, Germany, 2013 Stillwater, OK 74078 228 Physical Sciences 405-744-5807 dorival@okstate.edu Dorival Gon\u00e7alves is a theoretical particle physicist and assistant professor at the Department of Physics at OSU. He obtained his PhD in Physics from Heidelberg University (Germany) in 2013. Thereafter, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Max Planck Institute Munich (Germany) in 2013,\u00a0Durham University (UK) from 2013\u00a0to 2016, and at the University of Pittsburgh (USA) from 2016 to 2019. He joined OSU as an assistant professor in 2019. Dorival Gon\u00e7alves works on various aspects of Particle Physics within the Standard Model and beyond. He is particularly interested in using the Higgs boson as a precision handle\u00a0to\u00a0search for new physics.
