                "Platelet aggregation at sites of vascular injury is essential for hemostasis and arterial thrombosis. It has long been assumed that platelet aggregation and thrombus growth are initiated by soluble agonists generated at sites of vascular injury. By using high-resolution intravital imaging techniques and hydrodynamic analyses, we show that platelet aggregation is primarily driven by changes in blood flow parameters (rheology), with soluble agonists having a secondary role, stabilizing formed aggregates. We find that in response to vascular injury, thrombi initially develop through the progressive stabilization of discoid platelet aggregates. Analysis of blood flow dynamics revealed that discoid platelets preferentially adhere in low-shear zones at the downstream face of forming thrombi, with stabilization of aggregates dependent on the dynamic restructuring of membrane tethers. These findings provide insight into the \u2026",
                "Platelet aggregation, the process by which platelets adhere to each other at sites of vascular injury, has long been recognized as critical for hemostatic plug formation and thrombosis. Until relatively recently, platelet aggregation was considered a straightforward process involving the noncovalent bridging of integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptors on the platelet surface by the dimeric adhesive protein fibrinogen. However, with recent technical advances enabling real-time analysis of platelet aggregation in vivo, it has become apparent that this process is much more complex and dynamic than previously anticipated. Over the last decade, it has become clear that platelet aggregation represents a multistep adhesion process involving distinct receptors and adhesive ligands, with the contribution of individual receptor-ligand interactions to the aggregation process dependent on the prevailing blood flow conditions. It now appears \u2026",
                "Platelet activation at sites of vascular injury is essential for the arrest of bleeding; however, excessive platelet accumulation at regions of atherosclerotic plaque rupture can result in the development of arterial thrombi, precipitating diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Rheological disturbances (high shear stress) have an important role in promoting arterial thrombosis by enhancing the adhesive and signaling function of platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 (GPIIb-IIIa). In this study we have defined a key role for the Type Ia phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2 isoform in regulating the formation and stability of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 adhesion bonds, necessary for shear activation of platelets. Isoform-selective PI3K p110\u03b2 inhibitors have been developed which prevent formation of stable integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 adhesion contacts, leading to defective platelet thrombus formation. In vivo, these inhibitors eliminate \u2026",
                "The formation of blood clots\u2014thrombosis\u2014at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a major clinical problem despite ongoing improvements in antithrombotic therapy. Progress in identifying the pathogenic mechanisms regulating arterial thrombosis has led to the development of newer therapeutics, and there is general anticipation that these treatments will have greater efficacy and improved safety. However, major advances in this field require the identification of specific risk factors for arterial thrombosis in affected individuals and a rethink of the'one size fits all'approach to antithrombotic therapy.",
                " Recent in vivo studies have highlighted the dynamic and complex nature of platelet thrombus growth and the requirement for multiple adhesive receptor\u2013ligand interactions in this process. In particular, the importance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in promoting both primary adhesion and aggregation under high shear conditions is now well established. In general, the efficiency with which platelets adhere and aggregate at sites of vessel wall injury is dependent on the synergistic action of various adhesive and soluble agonist receptors, with the contribution of each of the individual receptors dependent on the prevailing blood flow conditions. In this review, we will discuss the major platelet adhesive interactions regulating platelet thrombus formation under high shear, with specific focus on the VWF (GPIb and integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23) and collagen receptors (GPVI and integrin \u03b12\u03b21). We will also discuss the signaling \u2026",
                "In this study we have examined the mechanism of platelet aggregation under physiological flow conditions using an in vitro flow-based platelet aggregation assay and an in vivo rat thrombosis model. Our studies demonstrate an unexpected complexity to the platelet aggregation process in which platelets in flowing blood continuously tether, translocate, and\/or detach from the luminal surface of a growing platelet thrombus at both arterial and venous shear rates. Studies of platelets congenitally deficient in von Willebrand factor (vWf) or integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 demonstrated a key role for platelet vWf in mediating platelet tethering and translocation, whereas integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 mediated cell arrest. Platelet aggregation under flow appears to be a multistep process involving: (a) exposure of vWf on the surface of immobilized platelets; (b) a reversible phase of platelet aggregation mediated by the binding of GPIb\u03b1 on the surface of \u2026",
                "It is well established that preexposure of human neutrophils to proinflammatory cytokines markedly augments the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to subsequent stimuli. This priming event is thought to be critical for localizing ROS to the vicinity of the inflammation, maximizing their role in the resolution of the inflammation, and minimizing the damage to surrounding tissue. We have used a new generation of isoform-selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors to show that ROS production under these circumstances is regulated by temporal control of class I PI3K activity. Stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-primed human neutrophils with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) results in biphasic activation of PI3K; the first phase is largely dependent on PI3K\u03b3, and the second phase is largely dependent on PI3K\u03b4. The second phase of PI3K activation requires the first phase \u2026",
                "Platelets have evolved highly specialized adhesion mechanisms that enable cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions throughout the entire vasculature irrespective of the prevailing hemodynamic conditions. This unique property of platelets is critical for their ability to arrest bleeding and promote vessel repair. Platelet adhesion under conditions of high shear stress, as occurs in stenotic atherosclerotic arteries, is central to the development of arterial thrombosis; therefore, precise control of platelet adhesion must occur to maintain blood fluidity and to prevent thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. Whereas the central role of platelets in hemostasis and thrombosis has long been recognized and well defined, there is now a major body of evidence supporting an important proinflammatory function for platelets that is linked to host defense and a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In the context of the \u2026",
                "Procoagulant platelets exhibit hallmark features of apoptotic cells, including membrane blebbing, microvesiculation, and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. Although platelets possess many well-known apoptotic regulators, their role in regulating the procoagulant function of platelets is unclear. To clarify this, we investigated the consequence of removing the essential mediators of apoptosis, Bak and Bax, or directly inducing apoptosis with the BH3 mimetic compound ABT-737. Treatment of platelets with ABT-737 triggered PS exposure and a marked increase in thrombin generation in vitro. This increase in procoagulant function was Bak\/Bax- and caspase-dependent, but it was unaffected by inhibitors of platelet activation or by chelating extracellular calcium. In contrast, agonist-induced platelet procoagulant function was unchanged in Bak\u2212\/\u2212Bax\u2212\/\u2212 or caspase inhibitor\u2013treated platelets, but it was completely \u2026",
                "The central importance of platelets in the development of arterial thrombosis and cardiovascular disease is well established. No other single cell type is responsible for as much morbidity and mortality as the platelet and, as a consequence, it represents a major target for therapeutic intervention. The growing awareness of the importance of platelets is reflected in the increasing number of patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, a trend that is likely to continue in the future. There are, however, significant drawbacks with existing therapies, including issues related to limited efficacy and safety. The discovery of a'magic bullet'that selectively targets pathological thrombus formation without undermining haemostasis remains elusive, although recent progress in unravelling the molecular events regulating thrombosis has provided promising new avenues to solve this long-standing problem."
