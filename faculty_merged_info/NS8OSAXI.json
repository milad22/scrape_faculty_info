                "The production of strings (disclination lines and loops) has been observed by means of the Kibble mechanism of domain (bubble) formation in the isotropic-nematic phase transition of the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal 4-cyano-49-n-pentylbiphenyl. The number of strings formed per bubble is about 0.6. This value is in reasonable agreement with a numerical simulation of the experiment in which the Kibble mechanism is used for the order parameter space of a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal.",
                "We report transient photocurrent measurements on solar cell structures based on dye-sensitized, porous TiO2 films filled with a liquid electrolyte. The measurements are interpreted as ambipolar diffusion; under most measurement conditions, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient is dominated by electrons diffusing in the TiO2 matrix. We report a strong dependence of the ambipolar diffusion coefficient upon the photoexcitation density, as has been proposed previously. The coefficients vary from 10-8 cm2 s-1 at low density to 10-4 cm2 s-1 for densities of 1018 cm-3. At a specified photoexcitation density, ambipolar diffusion coefficients measured using weak laser pulses and optical bias are about 10 times larger than coefficients measured using large-intensity laser pulses. We describe trapping models for these effects based on an exponential distribution (T0 = 650 K) of electron trap levels in TiO2. We infer an electron \u2026",
                "We propose an experimental procedure for testing the Einstein relation for carrier drift and diffusion in semiconductors exhibiting non-Gaussian or dispersive transport. We present corresponding hole time-of-flight and steady-state photocarrier grating measurements in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a\u2212 S i: H). For a range of mobilities 10\u2212 5\u201310\u2212 2 cm 2\/V s we find that our estimates of hole diffusion are approximately twice as large as predicted by the Einstein relation and the mobility measurements. We consider the deviation to represent an upper bound to any true failure of the Einstein relation for hole transport in a\u2212 S i: H."

Bonding defects and metastability in amorphous silicon. Image from a recent paper illustrating the modes in k-space that are accessible to a photon within a solar cell. Light-trapping is essentially a random walk around these modes, ultimately leading to escape through the black \u201chatch\u201d at the top; this is \u201cergodic\u201d behavior. The plasmonic modes at a metal\/semiconductor interface enhance light-trapping in solar cells by increasing the number of modes that are confined within the solar cell.
