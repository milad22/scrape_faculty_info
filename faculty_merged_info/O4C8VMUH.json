                "Sarada G. Rajeev Professor of Physics and Mathematics PhD in Physics, Syracuse University, 1984 351\u00a0Bausch & Lomb Hall (585) 275-4796 Fax: (585) 273-3237 s.g.rajeev@rochester.edu Research Overview Professor Rajeev works on various problems in theoretical physics arising from high-energy physics , as well as other fields such as string theory, nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics and quantum information theory. The focus of most recent work has been on non-commutative geometry and probability theory, which has applications to understanding Yang-Mills fields as well as to string theory and even classical problems in hydrodynamics. Solitons in field theories of high energy physics and nonlinear optics is another theme of research."
