                "Elliot Lipeles Associate Professor Experimental Particle Physics, Collider Physics DRL 4N43 Honors include: Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (2010) Ph.D., California Institute of Technology 2004 B.A., University of Chicago, 1995 One of the largest outstanding questions in particle physics is what breaks the symmetry between the weak and electromagnetic forces. In the standard model of particle physics the Higgs boson breaks the symmetry, but it has not yet been observed and may not be the true actor. The focus of my research is to search for the Higgs boson and possible new processes in high-energy hadron collisions. This work was started as part of the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron and is currently being continued as part of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The LHC presents a major scientific opportunity, because it should have sufficient energy and intensity to either confirm or exclude the existence of a standard model Higgs boson. In addition to the Higgs and electroweak symmetry breaking, the LHC may produce clues to many other unanswered questions such as: How are gravity and quantum mechanics are reconciled? How is the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe generated? What is dark matter? If the Higgs exists, what prevents quantum corrections from causing its mass to diverge? Also as part of participating in the ATLAS experiment, I work on the online data selection system (trigger), including innovations for a the planned LHC and ATLAS upgrade.
