                "The Belle detector was designed and constructed to carry out quantitative studies of rare B-meson decay modes with very small branching fractions using an asymmetric e+ e\u2212 collider operating at the \u03d2 (4S) resonance, the KEK-B-factory. Such studies require data samples containing\u223c 10 7 B-meson decays. The Belle detector is configured around a 1.5 T superconducting solenoid and iron structure surrounding the KEK-B beams at the Tsukuba interaction region. B-meson decay vertices are measured by a silicon vertex detector situated just outside of a cylindrical beryllium beam pipe. Charged particle tracking is performed by a wire drift chamber (CDC). Particle identification is provided by dE\/dx measurements in CDC, aerogel threshold Cherenkov counter and time-of-flight counter placed radially outside of CDC. Electromagnetic showers are detected in an array of CsI (Tl) crystals located inside the solenoid coil \u2026",
                "We present a measurement of the standard model CP violation parameter sin 2 \u03c6 1 based on a 29.1 fb\u2212 1 data sample collected at the \u03d2 (4 S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212 collider. One neutral B meson is fully reconstructed as a J\/\u03c8 K S, \u03c8 (2 S) K S, \u03c7 c 1 K S, \u03b7 c K S, J\/\u03c8 K L, or J\/\u03c8 K* 0 decay and the flavor of the accompanying B meson is identified from its decay products. From the asymmetry in the distribution of the time intervals between the two B meson decay points, we determine sin 2 \u03c6 1= 0.99\u00b10.14 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst). We conclude that we have observed CP violation in the neutral B meson system.",
                "This document is the final report of the ATLAS-CMS Dark Matter Forum, a forum organized by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations with the participation of experts on theories of Dark Matter, to select a minimal basis set of dark matter simplified models that should support the design of the early LHC Run-2 searches. A prioritized, compact set of benchmark models is proposed, accompanied by studies of the parameter space of these models and a repository of generator implementations. This report also addresses how to apply the Effective Field Theory formalism for collider searches and present the results of such interpretations.",

The result is based on a sample of 6.07\u00d7 10 6 B B \u0304 events collected at the \u03d2 (4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric e+ e\u2212 storage ring.",
                "Dijet events are studied in the proton-proton collision data set recorded at s= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.5 fb\u2212 1 and 33.5 fb\u2212 1 respectively. Invariant mass and angular distributions are compared to background predictions and no significant deviation is observed. For resonance searches, a new method for fitting the background component of the invariant mass distribution is employed. The data set is then used to set upper limits at a 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Excited quarks with masses below 6.0 TeV are excluded, and limits are set on quantum black holes, heavy W\u2032 bosons, W* bosons, and a range of masses and couplings in a Z\u2032 dark matter mediator model. Model-independent limits on signals with a Gaussian shape are also set, using a new approach allowing factorization of \u2026"

He worked as a Chamberlain Fellow (2008\u20132012) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and joined the faculty at the University of Washington in Fall 2012. Professor Hsu began his career as an experimental particle physicist since undergraduate year. He installed and commissioned the Extreme Forward Calorimeter for Belle experiment at KEK in Japan and analyzed the earliest e+e- collision data to confirm the anomalous large production of B->eta'K for his master thesis under Paoti Chang's supervision. His Ph. D. thesis, done under the supervision of Frank Wuerthwein, was a detailed study of diboson production and the Standard Model Higgs search with CDF experiment at Fermilab. As a Chamberlain Fellow, Hsu led the development and commissioning of ATLAS Pixel DAQ software in particular the Read Out Drive Digital Signal Processing, pioneered in the Inner Detector tracking alignment and played significant role on muon performance studies in both pronton-proton and heavy ion collision. He led the first measurement of ZZ production and search of ZZ resonance at high mass. Hsu served as the Standard Model Electroweak co-convener and diboson contacts in the LHC Electroweak Working Group since 2011. Professor Hsu continues the investigations of electroweak symmetry breaking by measuring the properties of 126 GeV particle discovered in July 2012 at LHC and the search of physics beyond the Standard Model by studying vector boson scattering at TeV energy scale with boosted jet substructure techniques.
