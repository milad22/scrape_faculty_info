                "Neutron stars with very strong surface magnetic fields have been suggested as the site for the origin of observed soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). In this paper we investigate the influence of such strong magnetic fields on the properties and internal structure of these strongly magnetized neutron stars (magnetars). We study properties of a degenerate equilibrium ideal neutron\u2010proton\u2010electron (npe) gas with and without the effects of the anomalous nucleon magnetic moment in a strong magnetic field. The presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field changes the ratio of protons to neutrons as well as the neutron drip density. We also study the appearance of muons as well as pion condensation in strong magnetic fields. We discuss the possibility that boson condensation in the interior of magnetars might be a source of SGRs."
