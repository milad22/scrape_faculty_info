                "Observations of neutral-current \u03bd interactions on deuterium in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory are reported. Using the neutral current (NC), elastic scattering, and charged current reactions and assuming the standard 8 B shape, the \u03bd e component of the 8 B solar flux is \u03c6 e= 1.76\u2212 0.05+ 0.05 (stat)\u2212 0.09+ 0.09 (syst)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 for a kinetic energy threshold of 5 MeV. The non-\u03bd e component is \u03c6 \u03bc \u03c4= 3.41\u2212 0.45+ 0.45 (stat)\u2212 0.45+ 0.48 (syst)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1, 5.3 \u03c3 greater than zero, providing strong evidence for solar \u03bd e flavor transformation. The total flux measured with the NC reaction is \u03c6 NC= 5.09\u2212 0.43+ 0.44 (stat)\u2212 0.43+ 0.46 (syst)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1, consistent with solar models.",
                "KamLAND has measured the flux of \u03bd e\u2019s from distant nuclear reactors. We find fewer \u03bd e events than expected from standard assumptions about \u03bd e propagation at the 99.95% CL In a 162 ton\u00b7 y r exposure the ratio of the observed inverse \u03b2-decay events to the expected number without \u03bd e disappearance is 0.611\u00b10.085 (s t a t)\u00b10.041 (s y s t) for \u03bd e energies> 3.4 M e V. In the context of two-flavor neutrino oscillations with CPT invariance, all solutions to the solar neutrino problem except for the \u201clarge mixing angle\u201d region are excluded.",
                "Solar neutrinos from 8 B decay have been detected at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory via the charged current (CC) reaction on deuterium and the elastic scattering (ES) of electrons. The flux of \u03bd e\u2019s is measured by the CC reaction rate to be \u03c6 CC (\u03bd e)= 1.75\u00b10.07 (stat)\u2212 0.11+ 0.12 (syst)\u00b10.05 (theor)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. Comparison of \u03c6 CC (\u03bd e) to the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration\u2019s precision value of the flux inferred from the ES reaction yields a 3.3 \u03c3 difference, assuming the systematic uncertainties are normally distributed, providing evidence of an active non-\u03bd e component in the solar flux. The total flux of active 8 B neutrinos is determined to be 5.44\u00b10.99\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1."
