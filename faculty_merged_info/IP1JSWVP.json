                "Observations of neutral-current \u03bd interactions on deuterium in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory are reported. Using the neutral current (NC), elastic scattering, and charged current reactions and assuming the standard 8 B shape, the \u03bd e component of the 8 B solar flux is \u03c6 e= 1.76\u2212 0.05+ 0.05 (stat)\u2212 0.09+ 0.09 (syst)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 for a kinetic energy threshold of 5 MeV.

We find fewer \u03bd e events than expected from standard assumptions about \u03bd e propagation at the 99.95% CL In a 162 ton\u00b7 y r exposure the ratio of the observed inverse \u03b2-decay events to the expected number without \u03bd e disappearance is 0.611\u00b10.085 (s t a t)\u00b10.041 (s y s t) for \u03bd e energies> 3.4 M e V. In the context of two-flavor neutrino oscillations with CPT invariance, all solutions to the solar neutrino problem except for the \u201clarge mixing angle\u201d region are excluded.",
                "Solar neutrinos from 8 B decay have been detected at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory via the charged current (CC) reaction on deuterium and the elastic scattering (ES) of electrons. The flux of \u03bd e\u2019s is measured by the CC reaction rate to be \u03c6 CC (\u03bd e)= 1.75\u00b10.07 (stat)\u2212 0.11+ 0.12 (syst)\u00b10.05 (theor)\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. Comparison of \u03c6 CC (\u03bd e) to the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration\u2019s precision value of the flux inferred from the ES reaction yields a 3.3 \u03c3 difference, assuming the systematic uncertainties are normally distributed, providing evidence of an active non-\u03bd e component in the solar flux. The total flux of active 8 B neutrinos is determined to be 5.44\u00b10.99\u00d7 10 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1."

His research focuses on the study of neutrino oscillations, neutrino mass, and dark matter. Prof. Heeger received his undergraduate degree in physics from Oxford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in Seattle where he worked on a model-independent measurement of the solar 8 B neutrino flux in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Before joining the faculty at Yale University he was on the faculty at the University of Wisconsin and a Chamberlain Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. His work has been recognized with numerous awards, and he has served on national and international committees including the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC), the DPF Executive Committee, the DNP Nominating Committee, and the APS Committee on International Scientific Affairs. Prof. Heeger is Associate Editor for the European Physical Journal C and Journal of Physics G. Professor Heeger\u2019s research focuses on the study of neutrino oscillations, neutrino mass, and dark matter. His thesis work was on the first model-independent measurement of the 8B solar neutrino flux with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) that led to the resolution of the solar neutrino problem. Heeger was involved in the first observation of reactor antineutrino oscillation with KamLAND and discovered non-zero theta13 with Daya Bay. Heeger is now searching for neutrinoless double beta decay and studying the nature of neutrinos with CUORE, probing the existence of sterile neutrinos with PROSPECT, and performing R&D with Project 8 towards a novel experiment to measure neutrino mass. Heeger collaborates with the DM-Ice project at the South Pole to test DAMA\u2019s claim for the detection of dark matter. Ph.D., University of Washington, Seattle, 2002 Honors & Awards: Heeger\u2019s research has been recognized with numerous awards. For his thesis work he was awarded the 2003 APS Dissertation Award in Nuclear Physics. In 2008 he received Outstanding Junior Investigator awards from DOE Nuclear Physics for the investigation of neutrino properties with bolometric detectors and from DOE High Energy Physics for the measurement of the neutrino mixing angle theta13 at Daya Bay. Heeger was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2009 and a UW Romnes Faculty Fellowship in 2011. He was named a Kavli Fellow in 2012 and elected APS Fellow in 2013. He shared the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics as a member of three collaborations: SNO, KamLAND, and Daya Bay.
