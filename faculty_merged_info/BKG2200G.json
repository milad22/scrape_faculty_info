                "High\u2010resolution multispacecraft magnetic field measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission's flux\u2010gate magnetometer are employed to examine statistical properties of plasma turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath and in the solar wind. Quantities examined include wave number spectra; structure functions of order two, four, and six; probability density functions of increments; and scale\u2010dependent kurtoses of the magnetic field. We evaluate the Taylor frozen\u2010in approximation by comparing single\u2010spacecraft time series analysis with direct multispacecraft measurements, including evidence based on comparison of probability distribution functions. The statistics studied span spatial scales from the inertial range down to proton and electron scales. We find agreement of spectral estimates using three different methods, and evidence of intermittent turbulence in both magnetosheath and solar wind \u2026"
