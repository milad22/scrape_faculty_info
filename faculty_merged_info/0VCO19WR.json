                "Historic and ongoing sediment contamination adversely affects estuaries, among the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. However, all estuaries are not the same, and estuarine sediments cannot be treated as either fresh or marine sediments or properly assessed without understanding both seasonal and spatial estuarine variability and processes, which are reviewed. Estuaries are physicochemically unique, primarily because of their variable salinity but also because of their strong gradients in other parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and amount and composition of particles. Salinity (overlying and interstitial) varies spatially (laterally, vertically) and temporally and is the controlling factor for partitioning of contaminants between sediments and overlying or interstitial water. Salinity also controls the distribution and types of estuarine biota. Benthic infauna are \u2026",
                "Les principales mati\u00e8res liant les m\u00e9taux dans les couches de s\u00e9diments a\u00e9robies sont les oxyhydroxydes de fer et de mangan\u00e8se (FeOOH et MnOOH) et le carbone organique particulaire (COP). Le mod\u00e8le du sulfure volatil acide propos\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9dire la non-toxicit\u00e9 de s\u00e9diments contamin\u00e9s par des m\u00e9taux ne s'applique qu'aux s\u00e9diments ana\u00e9robies. Dans d'autres s\u00e9diments, la normalisation par rapport au COP ou au FeOOH et MnOOH permet de faire des pr\u00e9visions, mais les constantes de liaison sont mal connues. La formation de complexes avec des ligands et l'oxydation des s\u00e9diments ana\u00e9robies augmentent la mobilisation des m\u00e9taux. L'ion m\u00e9tallique libre est la principale forme biodisponible, mais d'autres formes labiles de m\u00e9taux le sont \u00e9galement et des variables non sp\u00e9cifiques ont aussi un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer dans la biodisponibilit\u00e9; des mod\u00e8les de liaison \u00e0 un site biotique se sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s prometteurs \u2026",
                "Increasing emphasis is being placed upon chemical analyses of sediments to determine the distribution and concentration of toxic chemicals in marine and aquatic environments. The resulting data are often used to characterize chemical accumulations, including delineation of \u2018hotspots\u2019. These data alone, however, provide no information regarding the possible biological significance of these accumulations. Direct biological testing is needed. the use of a Sediment Quality Triad (chemical, bioassay and infauna) of measurements is advocated here by the authors. The purpose of this study was to determine the correspondence among measures of the three components of the Triad, using available data from several studies of Puget Sound. Good overall correspondence among the three components of the Triad was observed, based upon a comparison of average values from urban and rural portions of the Sound \u2026",
                "It is difficult to determine cause-effect relationships resulting from mixtures of chemical contaminants found in natural sediments. However, such relationships must involve bioavailability and can be suspected if there is a correspondence between chemical contamination and biological effects, particularly if such correspondence is based on synoptic measurements and involves the Sediment Quality Triad (chemistry to measure contamination, bioassay to measure toxicity, in situ biological assessment to measure effects such as benthic community alteration). Effects can include lethal, sublethal, chronic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, population or community responses, but do not include bioaccumulation per se, which is a phenomenon, not an effect. The combination of potential cause (chemistry) and effect (biology) measurements makes the Sediment Quality Triad one of the most complete and powerful tools available today \u2026",
                "Evaluation of environmental risks posed by potentially hazardous substances requires achieving a balance between over\u2010 and underprotection, i.e., between societal benefits posed by the use of particular substances and their potential risks. Uncertainty (e.g., only laboratory data may be available, field or epidemiological data may be limited and less than clear\u2010cut, etc.) will always exist and is often conservatively dealt with by the use of so\u2010called \u201csafety\u201d or \u201cuncertainty\u201d factors, some of which remain relatively little changed since their origin in 1945. Extrapolations involving safety factors for both aquatic and terrestrialenvironments include inter\u2010 and intraspecies, acute\u2010to\u2010chronic, lowest\u2010 to no\u2010observed\u2010effect concentration (NOEC), and laboratory\u2010to\u2010field extrapolation (e.g., extrapolation of laboratory results to the field). To be realistic, such extrapolations need to have a clear relationship with the field effect of \u2026",
                "Environmental toxicology has been and continues to be an important discipline (e.g., single-species testing for screening purposes). However, ecological toxicology (ecotoxicology \u2013 more realism in tests, test species and exposures) is required for predicting real world effects and for site-specific assessments. Ecotoxicology and ecology have shown similar developmental patterns over time; closer cooperation between ecologists and toxicologists would benefit both disciplines. Ecology can be incorporated into toxicology either extrinsically (separately, e.g., providing information on pre-selected test species) or intrinsically (e.g., as part of test species selection) \u2013 the latter is preferable. General guidelines for acute and chronic testing and criteria for species selection differ for ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology, and are outlined. An overall framework is proposed based on ecological risk assessment (ERA), for \u2026",
                "Contamination is simply the presence of a substance where it should not be or at concentrations above background. Pollution is contamination that results in or can result in adverse biological effects to resident communities. All pollutants are contaminants, but not all contaminants are pollutants. Differentiating pollution from contamination cannot be done solely on the basis of chemical analyses because such analyses provide no information on bioavailability or on toxicity. Effects-based measures such as laboratory or field toxicity tests and measures of the status of resident, exposed communities provide key information, but cannot be used independently to determine pollution status. Laboratory studies can be predictive, but are rarely realistic. Measures of resident communities include innate natural variability and cannot easily distinguish between adaptation to contamination (a genetic process) and acclimation (a \u2026",
                "Broad\u2010scale comparative data for sediment chemistry, sediment bioassays and bottom fish histopathology are used to derive quantitative site\u2010specific sediment criteria for three representative chemical contaminants in Puget Sound, Washington. The criteria, in terms of concentrations at or below which biological effects have been shown to be minimal, are (dry weight sediment): lead, 50 \u03bcg\/g (ppm); combustion polyaromatic hydrocarbons, 3.8 \u03bcg\/g; total polychlorinated biphenyls, 0.1 \u03bcg\/g.",
                "Current approaches to developing sediment quality criteria are reviewed and separated into two major groups: those approaches that provide only chemical\u2010by\u2010chemical criteria and those that provide criteria for chemical mixtures also. The individual approaches include background sediment chemistry, water quality criteria, sediment\/water equilibrium partitioning, sediment bioas\u2010say, screening level concentration, apparent effects threshold and sediment quality triad. Based on the evaluation of the two groups and seven individual approaches, it is concluded that, for chemical\u2010by\u2010chemical criteria, the equilibrium partitioning method shows promise; for criteria that are also applicable to chemical mixtures, the apparent effects threshold\/sediment quality triad approaches appear to be most appropriate. Recommendations are made concerning specific immediate research needs, related to developing effective \u2026",
                "The utility of the Sediment Quality Triad was assessed in determining pollution-induced degradation. This approach consists of synoptic measurements of sediment contamination by chemical analyses, sediment toxicity through bioassays, and benthic infaunal community structure through taxonomic analyses of macroinfauna. Each component of the Triad complements the other 2 and together all 3 components provide an objective assessment of pollution-induced degradation. The underlying hypothesis is that no component can be used to predict measurements of the other 2 components. Sediment samples were collected at 3 stations at each of 3 sites in San Francisco Bay, USA \u2013 Islais Waterway, near Oakland, and in San Pablo Bay \u2013 and subjected to 4 separate, replicated sediment bioassays, comprehensive sediment chemistry analyses (no replication), and replicated benthic infaunal analyses.
