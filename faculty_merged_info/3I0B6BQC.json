                "Direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is a powerful technique that can reveal Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, can enable detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres, and is a key step toward imaging Earth-like planets. Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system.",
                "We present deep VLT\/NACO infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of the brown dwarf 2MASSWJ\u20091207334-393254, obtained during our on-going adaptive optics survey of southern young, nearby associations. This ~25  brown dwarf, located ~70\u2009pc from Earth, has been recently identified as a member of the TW Hydrae Association (age ~ 8 Myr). Using adaptive optics infrared wavefront sensing to acquire sharp images of its circumstellar environment, we discovered a very faint and very red object at a close separation of ~780 mas (~55 AU). Photometry in the H, and bands and upper limit in J-band are compatible with a spectral type L5-L9.5. Near-infrared spectroscopy is consistent with this spectral type estimate. Different evolutionary models predict an object within the planetary regime with a mass of and an effective temperature of  K.",
                "We present an overview of the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph which was recently commissioned on the Keck II Telescope. OSIRIS works with the Keck Adaptive Optics system and utilizes an infrared transmissive lenslet array to sample a rectangular field of view at close to the Keck diffraction limit. By packing the spectra very closely together (2 pixel rows per spectrum) and using the Rockwell Hawaii-2 detector (wavelengths between 1 and 2.5 \u03bcm), we achieve a relatively large field of view (up to 6.4\u2033) while maintaining full broad-band spectral coverage at a resolution of 3800. Among the challenges of the instrument are: a fully cryogenic design (approximately 250 kg are brought down to 55 K); four spatial scales from 0.02 to 0.10\u2033; extremely low wavefront error (approximately 25 nm of non-common path error); large all aluminum optics for the spectrograph; extremely repeatable spectral formats; and a \u2026",
                "\u25a0 Abstract Until the late 1990s the rich Hyades and the sparse UMa clusters were the only coeval, comoving concentrations of stars known within 60 pc of Earth. Both are hundreds of millions of years old. Then beginning in the late 1990s the TW Hydrae Association, the Tucana\/Horologium Association, the \u03b2 Pictoris Moving Group, and the AB Doradus Moving Group were identified within\u223c 60 pc of Earth, and the \u03b7 Chamaeleontis cluster was found at 97 pc. These young groups (ages 8\u201350 Myr), along with other nearby, young stars, will enable imaging and spectroscopic studies of the origin and early evolution of planetary systems.",
                "The Gemini Planet Imager is a dedicated facility for directly imaging and spectroscopically characterizing extrasolar planets. It combines a very high-order adaptive optics system, a diffraction-suppressing coronagraph, and an integral field spectrograph with low spectral resolution but high spatial resolution. Every aspect of the Gemini Planet Imager has been tuned for maximum sensitivity to faint planets near bright stars. During first-light observations, we achieved an estimated H band Strehl ratio of 0.89 and a 5-\u03c3 contrast of 106 at 0.75 arcseconds and 105 at 0.35 arcseconds. Observations of Beta Pictoris clearly detect the planet, Beta Pictoris b, in a single 60-s exposure with minimal postprocessing. Beta Pictoris b is observed at a separation of 434 \u00b1 6 milliarcseconds (mas) and position angle 211.8 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0. Fitting the Keplerian orbit of Beta Pic b using the new position together with previous astrometry gives a factor of \u2026",

                " Following the 1983 IRAS detection and subsequent imaging of its extensive dusty circumstellar disk, \u03b2 Pictoris became the prototypical and most studied example of a potential forming planetary system. Here we report the identification of 17 star systems, each with one or more characteristics indicative of extreme youth, that are moving through space together with \u03b2 Pic. This diverse set of \u223c12 million yr old star systems, which includes a \u223c35 Jupiter mass brown dwarf, and a wide assortment of dusty circumstellar disks, is the comoving, youthful group closest to Earth. Their unique combination of youth and proximity to Earth makes group members\u2014many of which have masses similar to that of the Sun\u2014prime candidates for imaging of warm planets and dusty circumstellar disks with ground\u2010 and space\u2010based telescopes.",
                "Directly detecting thermal emission from young extrasolar planets allows measurement of their atmospheric compositions and luminosities, which are influenced by their formation mechanisms. Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the ~20-million-year-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13 astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water-vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and photometry yields a luminosity (normalized by the luminosity of the Sun) of 1.6 to 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 and an effective temperature of 600 to 750 kelvin. For this age and luminosity, \u201chot-start\u201d formation models indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the \u201ccold-start\u201d core-accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.",
                "We report new VLT\/NACO imaging observations of the young, nearby brown dwarf 2MASSW\u2009J1207334-393254 and its suggested planetary mass companion (2M1207\u2009b). Three epochs of VLT\/NACO measurements obtained over nearly one year show that the planetary mass companion candidate shares the same proper motion and, with a high confidence level, is not a stationary background object. This result confirms the status of 2M1207\u2009b as of planetary mass (5 times the mass of Jupiter) and the first image of a planetary mass companion in a different system than our own. This discovery offers new perspectives for our understanding of chemical and physical properties of planetary mass objects as well as their mechanisms of formation.",
                "We report deep imaging observations of the young, nearby star AB\u2009Pic, a member of the large Tucana-Horologium association. We have detected a faint, red source  South of the star with JHK colors compatible with that of a young substellar L dwarf. Follow-up observations at two additional epochs confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7\u03c3, that the faint red object is a companion to AB\u2009Pic rather than it being a stationary background object. A low resolution K-band spectrum indicates an early-L spectral type for the companion. Finally, evolutionary model predictions based on the JHK photometry of AB\u2009Pic\u2009b indicate a mass of 13 to 14  if its age is ~30 Myr. Is AB\u2009Pic\u2009b a massive planet or a minimum mass brown dwarf?"

Powe Faculty Award (ORAU), 2009 Are we alone in the Universe? , How did our Solar System start? I am working toward the answer to these questions via my various research projects. More specifically, I am interested in young stars in the solar neighborhood, origin and evolution of Solar Systemdirect, and detection of extra-solar planets. I have been working on stars with extremely large amount of dust particles (over million times more dust particles than in our Solar System). The huge amount of warm dust around these stars (e.g., BD+20 307 and HD 23514 ) is only explained by recent huge collisions between planetesimals or planets which is similar to the one that created the Earth-Moon system in our Solar system about 4 billion years ago.
