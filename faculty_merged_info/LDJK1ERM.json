                "This document proposes a collection of simplified models relevant to the design of new-physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the characterization of their results. Both ATLAS and CMS have already presented some results in terms of simplified models, and we encourage them to continue and expand this effort, which supplements both signature-based results and benchmark model interpretations. A simplified model is defined by an effective Lagrangian describing the interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified models can equally well be described by a small number of masses and cross-sections. These parameters are directly related to collider physics observables, making simplified models a particularly effective framework for evaluating searches and a useful starting point for characterizing positive signals of new physics. This document serves as an official summary of the \u2026",
                "We characterize a class of composite models in which the quarks and leptons and technifermions are built from fermions (preons) bound by strong gauge interactions. We argue that if the preon dynamics has as [SU (3)\u00d7 U (1)] 5 flavor symmetry that is explicitly broken only by preon mass terms proportional to the quark and lepton mass matrices, then the composite-tech-nicolor theory has a GIM mechanism that suppresses dangerous flavor changing neutral current effects. We show that the compositeness scale must be between\u2248 1 TeV and\u2248 2.5 TeV, giving rise to observable deviations from the standard electroweak interactions, and that B\ue5f8 B mixing and CP violation in K mesons can differ significantly from the standard model predictions. The lepton flavor symmetries may be observable in the near future in the comparison of the compositeness effects in e+ e\u2212\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 with those in e+ e\u2212\u2192 e+ e\u2212.",
                "We study electroweak symmetry breaking involving the seesaw mechanism of quark condensation. These models produce a composite Higgs boson involving the left-handed top quark, yet the top quark mass arises naturally at the observed scale. We describe a schematic model which illustrates the general dynamical ideas. We also consider a generic low-energy effective theory which includes several composite scalars, and we use the effective potential formalism to compute their spectrum. We develop a more detailed model in which certain features of the schematic model are replaced by additional dynamics.",

Sekhar Chivukula Ph.D., Harvard University, 1987 Office: Mayer Hall Addition 5601 Phone: (858)-246-3056 sekhar@ucsd.edu My work in particle physics has focused on questions related to electroweak symmetry breaking. Prior to the discovery of the Higgs boson, my work emphasized the construction of various possible models that could account for the masses of the W- and Z-bosons, and the identification of observational tests of these new models. In addition, many of the models I proposed and studied had potential consequences in the properties of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d at the earliest instances of our universe when temperatures were extremely high. Since the discovery of the Higgs boson, my attention has shifted to explore whether this new particle is truly fundamental, or whether it is a composite particle made of as yet undiscovered more fundamental particles.
