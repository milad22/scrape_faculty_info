                "Non-linear variation of certain physical properties with composition, similar to the mixed alkali effect (MAE), has been observed in phosphate glasses containing iron and vanadium ions in the xV2O5 \u00b7 (50 \u2212 x)Fe2O3 \u00b7 50P2O5 series. With the total concentration of transition ions (TIs) constant, gradual substitution of one TI (e.g. Fe in the binary composition Fe2O3\u2013P2O5) by the other (viz., V) increases dc resistivity (\u03c1), activation energy for dc conduction (W) and glass transition temperature (Tg) until these properties reach their maxima. Beyond the maxima, \u03c1, W and Tg are observed to decrease with increasing TI-ratio, V\/(V + Fe), until the binary P2O5\u2013V2O5 composition is reached. The non-linear variation of the physical properties with TI-ratio has been termed the \u2018mixed transition-ion effect\u2019 or MTE. The similarities between MTE and MAE are remarkable because the former is electronic in nature while the latter has \u2026",

                "Electrical and optical properties of phosphate glasses containing vanadium and manganese ions in the xP2O5\u2013[(100 \u2212 x)(V2O5 + MnO)] (PVM) system have been investigated. This is the last article of a III-part series devoted to the electronic properties of phosphate glasses containing a mixture of transition ions. The first article was devoted to the electrical conductivity of glasses having the general composition: xP2O5\u2013[(100 \u2212 x)(V2O5 + Fe2O3)] (PVF). Competitive transport of small polarons on V and Fe ion sites was found to contribute to a mixed transition-ion effect (MTE) in PVF glasses. Several features of MTE were found to be similar to the well known mixed alkali effect, observed in glasses containing two alkali ions. In the second article, optical absorption and electronic conduction of xP2O5\u2013[(100 \u2212 x)(Fe2O3 + MnO)] (PFM) glasses were reported. In the absence of competitive transport between the two \u2026",
                "The first article of this series reported electrical properties of phosphate glasses containing V and Fe ions, both of which contributed to conductivity. A mixed transition-ion effect was detected in such glasses which had several characteristics similar to the mixed alkali effect, observed in glasses containing two alkali ions. This article reports electrical and optical properties of phosphate glasses containing Fe and Mn ions, one of which (Mn) does not contribute directly to conductivity. DC resistivity by the Van der Pauw four-probe method and optical absorption (UV\u2013VIS\u2013IR) measurements have been performed on xP2O5 \u2212 (100 \u2212 x) (Fe2O3 + MnO) (PFM) glasses. The transport mechanism has been identified to be hopping of small polarons between Fe2+ and Fe3+ sites. For 0.3 < nFe < 0.5, where, nFe, the atomic fraction of Fe ions is given by (Fe\/(P + Fe + Mn)), a marginal linear increase in resistivity has been \u2026"
