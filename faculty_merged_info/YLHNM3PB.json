                "We present a lattice QCD calculation of the B\u2192 D l \u03bd semileptonic decay form factors f+(q 2) and f 0 (q 2) for the entire physical q 2 range. Nonrelativistic QCD bottom quarks and highly improved staggered quark charm and light quarks are employed together with N f= 2+ 1 MILC gauge configurations. A joint fit to our lattice and BABAR experimental data allows an extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element| V c b|. We also determine the phenomenologically interesting ratio R (D)= B (B\u2192 D \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4)\/B (B\u2192 D l \u03bd l)(l= e, \u03bc). We find| V c b| excl B\u2192 D= 0.0402 (17)(13), where the first error consists of the lattice simulation errors and the experimental statistical error and the second error is the experimental systematic error. For the branching fraction ratio we find R (D)= 0.300 (8).",
                "We present a new determination of the B and B s meson decay constants using nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) b-quarks, highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) light and strange valence quarks and the MILC collaboration N f= 2+ 1 lattices. The new calculations improve on HPQCD\u2019s earlier work with NRQCD b-quarks by replacing AsqTad with HISQ valence quarks, by including a more chiral MILC fine ensemble in the analysis, and by employing better tuned quark masses and overall scale. We find f B= 0.191 (9) GeV, f B s= 0.228 (10) GeV and f B s\/f B= 1.188 (18). Combining the new value for f B s\/f B with a recent very precise determination of the B s meson decay constant based on HISQ b-quarks, f B s= 0.225 (4) GeV, leads to f B= 0.189 (4) GeV. With errors of just 2.1% this represents the most precise f B available today.",
                "We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the decay constants f B and f B s with physical light quark masses. We use configurations generated by the MILC Collaboration including the effect of u, d, s, and c highly improved staggered quarks in the sea at three lattice spacings and with three u\/d quark mass values going down to the physical value. We use improved nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) for the valence b quarks. Our results are f B= 0.186 (4) GeV, f B s= 0.224 (4) GeV, f B s\/f B= 1.205 (7), and M B s\u2212 M B= 85 (2) MeV, superseding earlier results with NRQCD b quarks. We discuss the implications of our results for the standard model rates for B (s)\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and B\u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd.",
                "We present a new study of D semileptonic decays on the lattice which employs the highly improved staggered quark action for both the charm and the light valence quarks. We work with MILC unquenched N f= 2+ 1 lattices and determine the scalar form factor f 0 (q 2) for D\u2192 K, l \u03bd semileptonic decays. The form factor is obtained from a scalar current matrix element that does not require any operator matching. We develop a new approach to carrying out chiral\/continuum extrapolations of f 0 (q 2). The method uses the kinematic \u201cz\u201d variable instead of q 2 or the kaon energy E K and is applicable over the entire physical q 2 range. We find f 0 D\u2192 K (0)\u2261 f+ D\u2192 K (0)= 0.747 (19) in the chiral plus continuum limit and hereby improve the theory error on this quantity by a factor of\u223c 4 compared to previous lattice determinations.

                "We calculate, for the first time using unquenched lattice QCD form factors, the standard model differential branching fractions d B\/d q 2 (B\u2192 K \u2113+ \u2113\u2212) for \u2113= e, \u03bc, \u03c4 and compare with experimental measurements by Belle, BABAR, CDF, and LHCb. We report on B (B\u2192 K \u2113+ \u2113\u2212) in q 2 bins used by experiment and predict B (B\u2192 K \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212)=(1.41\u00b10.15)\u00d7 10\u2212 7. We also calculate the ratio of branching fractions R e \u03bc= 1.00029 (69) and predict R \u2113 \u03c4= 1.176 (40), for \u2113= e, \u03bc. Finally, we calculate the \u201cflat term\u201d in the angular distribution of the differential decay rate F H e, \u03bc, \u03c4 in experimentally motivated q 2 bins.",
                "We give results for the Upsilon spectrum from lattice QCD using an improved version of the nonrelativistic QCD action for b quarks which includes radiative corrections to kinetic terms at O (v 4) in the velocity expansion. We also include for the first time the effect of up, down, strange and charm quarks in the sea using \u201csecond generation\u201d gluon field configurations from the MILC Collaboration. Using the \u03a5 2 S\u2212 1 S splitting to determine the lattice spacing, we are able to obtain the 1 P\u2212 1 S splitting to 1.4% and the 3 S\u2212 1 S splitting to 2.4%. Our improved result for M (\u03a5)\u2212 M (\u03b7 b) is 70 (9) MeV and we predict M (\u03a5\u2032)\u2212 M (\u03b7 b\u2032)= 35 (3) MeV. We also calculate \u03c0, K and \u03b7 s correlators using the highly improved staggered quark action and perform a chiral and continuum extrapolation to give values for M \u03b7 s (0.6893 (12) GeV) and f \u03b7 s (0.1819 (5) GeV) that allow us to tune the strange quark mass as well as providing an \u2026",

Our lattice QCD calculation utilizes a nonrelativistic QCD formulation for the b valence quarks and the highly improved staggered quark formulation for the light valence quarks. We employ the MILC 2+ 1 asqtad ensembles. The form factor results, based on the z expansion, are valid over the full kinematic range of q 2. We construct the ratios f 0\/f+ and f T\/f+, which are useful in constraining new physics and verifying effective theory form factor symmetry relations. We also discuss the calculation of Standard Model observables.",

The coefficients of the \u03c3\u00b7 B term in the NRQCD action and the four-fermion spin-spin interaction are computed at the one-loop level; the resulting shift of the hyperfine splitting of bottomonium is found to bring the lattice predictions in line with experiment."
