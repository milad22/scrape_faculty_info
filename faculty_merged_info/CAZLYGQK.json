                "We report on a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy s= 1.96 TeV using data collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.70 fb\u2212 1. The data cover jet transverse momenta from 50 to 600 GeV and jet rapidities in the range\u2212 2.4 to 2.4. Detailed studies of correlations between systematic uncertainties in transverse momentum and rapidity are presented, and the cross section measurements are found to be in good agreement with next-to-leading order QCD calculations.",
                "Measurements of inclusive charged-hadron transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions are presented for proton-proton collisions at and 2.36 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector during the LHC commissioning in December 2009. For non-single-diffractive interactions, the average charged-hadron transverse momentum is measured to be 0.46\u00b10.01 (stat.)\u00b10.01 (syst.) GeV\/c at 0.9 TeV and 0.50\u00b10.01 (stat.)\u00b10.01 (syst.) GeV\/c at 2.36 TeV, for pseudorapidities between--2.4 and+ 2.4. At these energies, the measured pseudorapidity densities in the central region, dN ch\/d\u03b7|| \u03b7|< 0.5, are 3: 48\u00b10: 02 (stat.)\u00b10.13 (syst.) and 4: 47\u00b10: 04 (stat.)\u00b10.16 (syst.), respectively. The results at 0.9 TeV are in agreement with previous measurements and confirm the expectation of near equal hadron production in and pp collisions. The results at 2.36 TeV represent the highest-energy measurements \u2026",
                "The jet fragmentation function of inclusive jets with transverse momentum p T above 100 GeV\/c in PbPb collisions has been measured using reconstructed charged particles with p T above 1 GeV\/c in a cone of radius 0.3 around the jet axis. A data sample of PbPb collisions collected in 2011 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of s NN= 2.76 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150 \u03bc b\u2212 1 is used. The results for PbPb collisions as a function of collision centrality and jet transverse momentum are compared to reference distributions based on pp data collected at the same center-of-mass energy in 2013, with an integrated luminosity of 5.3 pb\u2212 1. A centrality-dependent modification of the fragmentation function is found. For the most central collisions, a significant enhancement is observed in the PbPb\/pp fragmentation function ratio for charged particles with p T less than 3 GeV\/c. This enhancement \u2026",
                "We present a measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in p p collisions at s= 1.96 TeV utilizing 425 pb\u2212 1 of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We consider the final state of the top quark pair containing one high-p T electron or muon and at least four jets. We exploit specific kinematic features of t t events to extract the cross section. For a top quark mass of 175 GeV, we measure \u03c3 t t= 6.4\u2212 1.2+ 1.3 (stat)\u00b10.7 (syst)\u00b10.4 (lum) pb, in good agreement with the standard model prediction.",
                "While Euroscepticism is the most important driver of United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) support, other attitudinal drivers \u2013 namely dissatisfaction towards mainstream parties and xenophobia \u2013 are also important. Examining vote\u2010switching between first\u2010 and second\u2010order elections evidence is found of a distinction between two types of supporter: more affluent and middle\u2010class \u2018strategic defectors\u2019 from the mainstream Conservative Party who support UKIP to register their Euroscepticism, and more economically marginal and politically disaffected \u2018core loyalists\u2019 who are attracted to UKIP by its anti\u2010immigration rhetoric and populist anti\u2010establishment strategy. UKIP also succeeds in attracting core support from groups such as women who have traditionally rejected extreme right parties such as the British National Party (BNP). This suggests that UKIP is well positioned to recruit a broader and more enduring \u2026",
                "The cross section for the inclusive production of isolated photons has been measured in p p\u00af collisions at s= 1.96 TeV with the D\u00d8 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The photons span transverse momenta 23 to 300 GeV and have pseudorapidity| \u03b7|< 0.9. The cross section is compared with the results from two next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The theoretical predictions agree with the measurement within uncertainties.",
                "A measurement of the W boson pair production cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV is presented. The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 inverse femtobarns. The W+ W-candidates are selected from events with two charged leptons, electrons or muons, and large missing transverse energy. The measured W+ W-cross section is 60.1+\/-0.9 (stat)+\/-3.2 (exp)+\/-3.1 (theo)+\/-1.6 (lum) pb= 60.1+\/-4.8 pb, consistent with the standard model prediction. The W+ W-cross sections are also measured in two different fiducial phase space regions. The normalized differential cross section is measured as a function of kinematic variables of the final-state charged leptons and compared with several perturbative QCD predictions. Limits on anomalous gauge couplings associated with dimension-six operators are also given in the framework of an effective field theory. The corresponding 95% confidence level intervals are-5.7< c [WWW]\/Lambda^ 2< 5.9 TeV^{-2},-11.4< c [W]\/Lambda^ 2< 5.4 TeV^{-2},-29.2< c [B]\/Lambda^ 2< 23.9 TeV^{-2}, in the HISZ basis.",
                "Measurements of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections are presented using an integrated luminosity of 4.5 (4.8) fb\u2212 1 in the dimuon (dielectron) channel of proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at= 7 TeV. The measured inclusive cross section in the Z-peak region (60\u2013120 GeV) is \u03c3 (\u2113\u2113)= 986.4\u00b10.6 (stat.)\u00b15.9 (exp. syst.)\u00b121.7 (th. syst.)\u00b121.7 (lum.) pb for the combination of the dimuon and dielectron channels. Differential cross sections d\u03c3\/dm for the dimuon, dielectron, and combined channels are measured in the mass range 15 to 1500 GeV and corrected to the full phase space. Results are also presented for the measurement of the double-differential cross section d 2 \u03c3\/dm d| y| in the dimuon channel over the mass range 20 to 1500 GeV and absolute dimuon rapidity from 0 to 2.4.

                "A measurement is presented of differential cross sections for Higgs boson (H) production in pp collisions at. The analysis exploits the decay in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The cross section is measured as a function of the kinematic properties of the diphoton system and of the associated jets. Results corrected for detector effects are compared with predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, as well as with predictions beyond the standard model. For isolated photons with pseudorapidities, and with the photon of largest and next-to-largest transverse momentum () divided by the diphoton mass satisfying the respective conditions of and, the total fiducial cross section is\\(\\text {\\, fb}\\).",
                "The performance of muon reconstruction in CMS is evaluated using a large data sample of cosmic-ray muons recorded in 2008. Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV\/c and is about 8% at 500 GeV\/c, the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions. Muon charge misassignment ranges from less than 0.01% at 10 GeV\/c to about 1% at 500 GeV\/c."
