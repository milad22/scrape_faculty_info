                "The AACR Project GENIE is an international data-sharing consortium focused on generating an evidence base for precision cancer medicine by integrating clinical-grade cancer genomic data with clinical outcome data for tens of thousands of cancer patients treated at multiple institutions worldwide. In conjunction with the first public data release from approximately 19,000 samples, we describe the goals, structure, and data standards of the consortium and report conclusions from high-level analysis of the initial phase of genomic data. We also provide examples of the clinical utility of GENIE data, such as an estimate of clinical actionability across multiple cancer types (>30%) and prediction of accrual rates to the NCI-MATCH trial that accurately reflect recently reported actual match rates. The GENIE database is expected to grow to >100,000 samples within 5 years and should serve as a powerful tool for precision \u2026",
                "We present the genome sequence of the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, which is a member of the kangaroo family and the first representative of the iconic hopping mammals that symbolize Australia to be sequenced. The tammar has many unusual biological characteristics, including the longest period of embryonic diapause of any mammal, extremely synchronized seasonal breeding and prolonged and sophisticated lactation within a well-defined pouch. Like other marsupials, it gives birth to highly altricial young, and has a small number of very large chromosomes, making it a valuable model for genomics, reproduction and development. The genome has been sequenced to 2 \u00d7 coverage using Sanger sequencing, enhanced with additional next generation sequencing and the integration of extensive physical and linkage maps to build the genome assembly. We also sequenced the tammar transcriptome across many tissues and developmental time points. Our analyses of these data shed light on mammalian reproduction, development and genome evolution: there is innovation in reproductive and lactational genes, rapid evolution of germ cell genes, and incomplete, locus-specific X inactivation. We also observe novel retrotransposons and a highly rearranged major histocompatibility complex, with many class I genes located outside the complex. Novel microRNAs in the tammar HOX clusters uncover new potential mammalian HOX regulatory elements. Analyses of these resources enhance our understanding of marsupial gene evolution, identify marsupial-specific conserved non-coding elements and critical genes across a range of \u2026",
                "The HOX gene clusters are thought to be highly conserved amongst mammals and other vertebrates, but the long non-coding RNAs have only been studied in detail in human and mouse. The sequencing of the kangaroo genome provides an opportunity to use comparative analyses to compare the HOX clusters of a mammal with a distinct body plan to those of other mammals. Here we report a comparative analysis of HOX gene clusters between an Australian marsupial of the kangaroo family and the eutherians. There was a strikingly high level of conservation of HOX gene sequence and structure and non-protein coding genes including the microRNAs miR-196a, miR-196b, miR-10a and miR-10b and the long non-coding RNAs HOTAIR, HOTAIRM1 and HOX A11AS that play critical roles in regulating gene expression and controlling development.

                "There is an ever-expanding range of technologies that generate very large numbers of biomarkers for research and clinical applications. Choosing the most informative biomarkers from a high-dimensional data set, combined with identifying the most reliable and accurate classification algorithms to use with that biomarker set, can be a daunting task. Existing surveys of feature selection and classification algorithms typically focus on a single data type, such as gene expression microarrays, and rarely explore the model's performance across multiple biological data types. This paper presents the results of a large scale empirical study whereby a large number of popular feature selection and classification algorithms are used to identify the tissue of origin for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. A computational pipeline was implemented to maximize predictive accuracy of all models at all parameters on five different data types available for the NCI-60 cell lines. A validation experiment was conducted using external data in order to demonstrate robustness. As expected, the data type and number of biomarkers have a significant effect on the performance of the predictive models. Although no model or data type uniformly outperforms the others across the entire range of tested numbers of markers, several clear trends are visible. At low numbers of biomarkers gene and protein expression data types are able to differentiate between cancer cell lines significantly better than the other three data types, namely SNP, array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH), and microRNA data. Interestingly, as the number of selected biomarkers increases best performing \u2026",
                "Small RNAs have proven to be essential regulatory molecules encoded within eukaryotic genomes. These short RNAs participate in a diverse array of cellular processes including gene regulation, chromatin dynamics and genome defense. The tammar wallaby, a marsupial mammal, is a powerful comparative model for studying the evolution of regulatory networks. As part of the genome sequencing initiative for the tammar, we have explored the evolution of each of the major classes of mammalian small RNAs in an Australian marsupial for the first time, including the first genome-scale analysis of the newest class of small RNAs, centromere repeat associated short interacting RNAs (crasiRNAs). Using next generation sequencing, we have characterized the major classes of small RNAs, micro (mi) RNAs, piwi interacting (pi) RNAs, and the centromere repeat associated short interacting (crasi) RNAs in the tammar. We examined each of these small RNA classes with respect to the newly assembled tammar wallaby genome for gene and repeat features, salient features that define their canonical sequences, and the constitution of both highly conserved and species-specific members. Using a combination of miRNA hairpin predictions and co-mapping with miRBase entries, we identified a highly conserved cluster of miRNA genes on the X chromosome in the tammar and a total of 94 other predicted miRNA producing genes. Mapping all miRNAs to the tammar genome and comparing target genes among tammar, mouse and human, we identified 163 conserved target genes. An additional nine genes were identified in tammar that do not have an \u2026",
                "Interest in de novo genome assembly has been renewed in the past decade due to rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies which generate relatively short reads resulting in highly fragmented assemblies consisting of contigs. Additional long-range linkage information is typically used to orient, order, and link contigs into larger structures referred to as scaffolds. Due to library preparation artifacts and erroneous mapping of reads originating from repeats, scaffolding remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we provide a scalable scaffolding algorithm (SILP2) employing a maximum likelihood model capturing read mapping uncertainty and\/or non-uniformity of contig coverage which is solved using integer linear programming. A Non-Serial Dynamic Programming (NSDP) paradigm is applied to render our algorithm useful in the processing of larger mammalian genomes. To compare \u2026",
                "The rapidly diminishing cost of genome sequencing is driving renewed interest in large scale genome sequencing programs such as Genome 10K (G10K). Despite renewed interest the assembly of large genomes from short reads is still an extremely resource intensive process. This work presents a scalable algorithms to create scaffolds, or ordered and oriented sets of assembled contigs, which is one part of a practical assembly. This is accomplished using integer linear programming (ILP). In order to process large mammalian genomes we employ non-serial dynamic programming (NSDP) and a hierarchical strategy. Both existing and novel quantitative metrics are used to compare scaffolding tools and gain deeper insight into the challenges of scaffolding.

                "Molecular profiling of cancers is now routine at many cancer centers, and the number of precision cancer medicine clinical trials, which are informed by profiling, is steadily rising. Additionally, these trials are becoming increasingly complex, often having multiple arms and many genomic eligibility criteria. Currently, it is a challenging for physicians to match patients to relevant clinical trials using the patient\u2019s genomic profile, which can lead to missed opportunities. Automated matching against uniformly structured and encoded genomic eligibility criteria is essential to keep pace with the complex landscape of precision medicine clinical trials.To meet these needs, we built and deployed an automated clinical trial matching platform called MatchMiner at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The platform has been integrated with Profile, DFCI\u2019s enterprise genomic profiling project, which contains tumor profile data for >20,000 patients, and has been made available to physicians across the Institute. As no current standard exists for encoding clinical trial eligibility criteria, a new language called Clinical Trial Markup Language (CTML) was developed, and over 158 genomically-driven clinical trials were encoded using this language. The platform is open source and freely available for adoption by other institutions.MatchMiner is the first open platform developed to enable computational matching of patient-specific genomic profiles to precision cancer medicine clinical trials. Creating MatchMiner required developing clinical trial eligibility standards to support genome-driven matching and developing intuitive interfaces to \u2026",
