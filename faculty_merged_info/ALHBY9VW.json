                "We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16\u2264 z\u2264 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H 0), the mass density (\u03a9 M), the cosmological constant (ie, the vacuum energy density, \u03a9 \u039b), the deceleration parameter (q 0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t 0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%\u201315% farther than expected in a low mass density (\u03a9 M= 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant.

                "The High\u2010z Supernova Search Team has discovered and observed eight new supernovae in the redshift interval  \u20131.2. These independent observations, analyzed by similar but distinct methods, confirm the results of Riess and Perlmutter and coworkers that supernova luminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. More importantly, they extend the redshift range of consistently observed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to  , where the signature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausible systematic effects. Consequently, these measurements not only provide another quantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute a powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration. We find a rate for SN Ia of   at a mean redshift of 0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for 230 SN Ia. These place the following constraints on cosmological quantities \u2026",
                "The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z> 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z\u2265 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25< z< 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral \u2026",
                "We use Type Ia supernovae studied by the High-z Supernova Search Team to constrain the properties of an energy component that may have contributed to accelerating the cosmic expansion. We find that for a flat geometry the equation-of-state parameter for the unknown component, \u03b1 x= P x\/\u03c1 x, must be less than-0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of \u03a9 m, and it is further limited to \u03b1 x<-0.60 (95% confidence) if \u03a9 m is assumed to be greater than 0.1. These values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topological defects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. The supernova (SN) data are consistent with a cosmological constant (\u03b1 x=-1) or a scalar field that has had, on average, an equation-of-state parameter similar to the cosmological constant value of-1 over the redshift range of z\u2248 1 to the present. SN and cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints on the \u2026",
                "We present constraints on the dark energy equation\u2010of\u2010state parameter,  , using 60 SNe Ia from the ESSENCE supernova survey. We derive a set of constraints on the nature of the dark energy assuming a flat universe. By including constraints on (\u03a9M, w) from baryon acoustic oscillations, we obtain a value for a static equation\u2010of\u2010state parameter   and   with a best\u2010fit \u03c72\/dof of 0.96. These results are consistent with those reported by the Supernova Legacy Survey from the first year of a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. We evaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations and present Monte Carlo simulations that explore these effects. Currently, the largest systematic with the potential to affect our measurements is the treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies.

                "We have coordinated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry with ground-based discovery for three supernovae: Type Ia supernovae near z\u2248 0.5 (SN 1997ce, SN 1997cj) and a third event at z= 0.97 (SN 1997ck). The superb spatial resolution of HST separates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision in the light curves. We use these light curves and relations between luminosity, light-curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples to derive relative luminosity distances that are accurate to 10% at z\u2248 0.5 and 20% at z= 1. When the HST sample is combined with the distance to SN 1995K (z= 0.48), analyzed by the same precepts, we find that matter alone is insufficient to produce a flat universe. Specifically, for \u03a9 m+ \u03a9 \u039b= 1, \u03a9 m is less than 1 with more than 95% confidence, and our best estimate of \u03a9 m is-0.1\u00b10.5 if \u03a9 \u039b= 0. Although this result is based on a very small sample \u2026"
