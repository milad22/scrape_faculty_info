                "This Article takes a law and economics approach to exploring some of the costs that arise when governments rely on private enforcement to accomplish the goals of public law. The analysis focuses on qui tam enforcement under the Civil False Claims Act, because a remarkable body of empirical data demonstrates the expansive role private qui tam relators are playing in enforcing Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse laws. The Article further focuses on the application of these laws to the pharmaceutical industry. This focus is enlightening because the Government, as well as private enforcers have recently targeted this industry so that emerging legal trends in private enforcement ars readily evident. The economic concept of moral hazard\u2014a wellrecognized theory that a person takes more risks and exercises less care when insured than she would if uninsured\u2014is applied to reconceptuatize the costs and \u2026",
                "Offers an innovative plan to eliminate inequalities in American health care and save the lives they endanger Over 84,000 black and brown lives are needlessly lost each year due to health disparities: the unfair, unjust, and avoidable differences between the quality and quantity of health care provided to Americans who are members of racial and ethnic minorities and care provided to whites. Health disparities have remained stubbornly entrenched in the American health care system\u2014and in Just Medicine Dayna Bowen Matthew finds that they principally arise from unconscious racial and ethnic biases held by physicians, institutional providers, and their patients. Implicit bias is the single most important determinant of health and health care disparities. Because we have missed this fact, the money we spend on training providers to become culturally competent, expanding wellness education programs and community health centers, and even expanding access to health insurance will have only a modest effect on reducing health disparities. We will continue to utterly fail in the effort to eradicate health disparities unless we enact strong, evidence-based legal remedies that accurately address implicit and unintentional forms of discrimination, to replace the weak, tepid, and largely irrelevant legal remedies currently available. Our continued failure to fashion an effective response that purges the effects of implicit bias from American health care, Matthew argues, is unjust and morally untenable. In this book, she unites medical, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology research on implicit bias and health disparities with her own expertise in civil rights \u2026",
                "With the rise in health care costs, attempts to control these expenditures have been proposed by Congress, state legislatures, and perhaps most notably, employers. Using a reverse agency model, Professor Matthew explores the role of health insurance in the employeremployee relationship and describes how this reverse agency model identifies potential conflicts of interests among the parties. For example, employers seek to minimize operating costs while maximizing profit, which is a goal that may interfere with the employer's role as agent when obtaining health insurance for its employees. Professor Matthew finds that employees have little actual control over the selection of health care benefits, thus resulting in a compromise of the traditional element of continuous control in an agency relationship. These problems often lead to an acrimonious workplace, which is becoming increasingly uninsured due to rising \u2026",
                "That minority patients have not figured at all in the literature about informed consent is an egregious omission which this article begins to repair. Moreover, the article demonstrates that by addressing identifiable harms which informed consent law now causes to racial, religious, and ethnic minority patients, the law may also better address many of the concerns legal commentators have been discussing for years with only majority patients in mind. Ironically, the solution to the discrimination felt by the excluded members of society may turn out to provide the remedy for the informed consent doctrine as a whole.",
                "In politics, a\" hot\" issue is one that gets voters excited, candidates elected, and politicians visibility. Typically, these issues address legitimate problems that resonate across a broad cross section of the population. These issues are all the more beloved by politicians if they reap not only political but tangible financial benefits for those devotees acting (on principal, of course) to advance a popular cause or address a pressing problem. The effort to quash Medicare and Medicaid fraud is such a\" hot\" issue. At bottom, the billions of dollars wasted to pay fraudulent medical claims is a legitimate and quantifiable problem. 1 Moreover, this problem cuts broadly as every American faces the very real question of how to control health care costs. 2 However, this Article questions the economic and ethical wisdom of one of the\" hottest\" legal weapons in the fight against medical fraud: tainted-claims prosecutions under the Federal \u2026",
                "Since its inception in 1965, the Medicaid program has been at the center of a pendulous dance between the federal and states' governments that jointly control its funding and administration. Strong federal oversight and policy control marked the Medicaid program initially. However, from its inception the Medicaid program allowed states considerable flexibility through various waiver programs. 1 From 1981 to roughly 1990, the states increasingly gained the power to exercise discretion in administering Medicaid to their neediest citizens. 2 In 1990, the",
                "In the spring of 2010, the United States joined the rest of the developed world in extending access to basic health care to all its citizens. Yet, while the American government has affirmatively answered one fundamental questionshould health care be universal?-it has done so by creating a myriad of new entities and obligations that are fundamental to the success and survival of the health reform itself. Each and every one of these new entities will need to be defined; their responsibilities will have to be articulated and their roles explained. Not since\" the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field\" 1 has there been such a massive creative challenge.",
                "Recently, a group of researchers reported that physician implicit race and ethicity biases do not affect their hypertension treatment for minority patients nor do such biases impact health outcomes for these patients. 1 These findings are counterintuitive. Moreover, they are contrary to the weight of the emerging empirical record that has suggested that physician implicit bias is inversely related to the quality of doctors' treatment decisions, communication with, and perceptions of their minority patients. Examples include findings that"
