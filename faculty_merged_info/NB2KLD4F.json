                "Rapid, site-specific labeling of proteins with diverse probes remains an outstanding challenge for chemical biologists. Enzyme-mediated labeling approaches may be rapid but use protein or peptide fusions that introduce perturbations into the protein under study and may limit the sites that can be labeled, while many \u201cbioorthogonal\u201d reactions for which a component can be genetically encoded are too slow to effect quantitative site-specific labeling of proteins on a time scale that is useful for studying many biological processes. We report a fluorogenic reaction between bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-yn-9-ylmethanol (BCN) and tetrazines that is 3\u20137 orders of magnitude faster than many bioorthogonal reactions. Unlike the reactions of strained alkenes, including trans-cyclooctenes and norbornenes, with tetrazines, the BCN\u2013tetrazine reaction gives a single product of defined stereochemistry. We have discovered aminoacyl \u2026",
                "The ability to introduce different biophysical probes into defined positions in target proteins will provide powerful approaches for interrogating protein structure, function and dynamics. However, methods for site-specifically incorporating multiple distinct unnatural amino acids are hampered by their low efficiency. Here we provide a general solution to this challenge by developing an optimized orthogonal translation system that uses amber and evolved quadruplet-decoding transfer RNAs to encode numerous pairs of distinct unnatural amino acids into a single protein expressed in Escherichia coli with a substantial increase in efficiency over previous methods. We also provide a general strategy for labelling pairs of encoded unnatural amino acids with different probes via rapid and spontaneous reactions under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by genetically directing the labelling of \u2026",
                "Computation has guided the design of conformationally-strained dioxolane-fused trans-cyclooctene (d-TCO) derivatives that display excellent reactivity in the tetrazine ligation. A water soluble derivative of 3,6-dipyridyl-s-tetrazine reacts with d-TCO with a second order rate k2 366\u2006000 (\u00b115\u2006000) M\u22121 s\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C in pure water. Furthermore, d-TCO derivatives can be prepared easily, are accessed through diastereoselective synthesis, and are typically crystalline bench-stable solids that are stable in aqueous solution, blood serum, or in the presence of thiols in buffered solution. GFP with a genetically encoded tetrazine-containing amino acid was site-specifically labelled in vivo by a d-TCO derivative. The fastest bioorthogonal reaction reported to date [k2 3\u2006300\u2006000 (\u00b140\u2006000) M\u22121 s\u22121 in H2O at 25 \u00b0C] is described herein with a cyclopropane-fused trans-cyclooctene. d-TCO derivatives display rates within an \u2026",
                "The discovery and exploration of bioorthogonal chemical reactions and the biosynthetic incorporation of their components into biomolecules for specific labelling is an important challenge. Here we describe the reaction of a phenyl sydnone 1,3-dipole with a bicyclononyne dipolarophile. This strain-promoted reaction proceeds without transition metal catalysis in aqueous buffer, at physiological temperature, and pressure with a rate comparable to that of other bioorthogonal reactions. We demonstrate the quantitative and specific labelling of a genetically encoded bicyclononyne with a sydnone fluorophore conjugate, demonstrating the utility of this approach for bioorthogonal protein labelling.",
                "Organic chemists and metabolic engineers use largely orthogonal technologies to access small molecules like pharmaceuticals and commodity chemicals. As the use of biological catalysts and engineered organisms for chemical production grows, it is becoming increasingly evident that future efforts for chemical manufacture will benefit from the integration and unified expansion of these two fields. This review will discuss approaches that combine chemical and biological synthesis for small molecule production. We highlight recent advances in combining enzymatic and non-enzymatic catalysis in vitro, discuss the application of design principles from organic chemistry for engineering non-biological reactivity into enzymes, and describe the development of biocompatible chemistry that can be interfaced with microbial metabolism.",
                "The introduction of new reactivity into living organisms is a major challenge in synthetic biology. Despite an increasing interest in both the development of small\u2010molecule catalysts that are compatible with aqueous media and the engineering of enzymes to perform new chemistry in vitro, the integration of non\u2010native reactivity into metabolic pathways for small\u2010molecule production has been underexplored. Herein we report a biocompatible iron(III) phthalocyanine catalyst capable of efficient olefin cyclopropanation in the presence of a living microorganism. By interfacing this catalyst with E.\u2005coli engineered to produce styrene, we synthesized non\u2010natural phenyl cyclopropanes directly from D\u2010glucose in single\u2010vessel fermentations. This process is the first example of the combination of nonbiological carbene\u2010transfer reactivity with cellular metabolism for small\u2010molecule production.",
                "Synthetic biology has enabled the production of many value\u2010added chemicals via microbial fermentation. However, the problem of low product titers from recombinant pathways has limited the utility of this approach. Methods to increase metabolic flux are therefore critical to the success of metabolic engineering. Here we demonstrate that vitamin\u2005E\u2010derived designer micelles, originally developed for use in synthetic chemistry, are biocompatible and accelerate flux through a styrene production pathway in Escherichia coli. We show that these micelles associate non\u2010covalently with the bacterial outer\u2010membrane and that this interaction increases membrane permeability. In addition, these micelles also accommodate both heterogeneous and organic\u2010soluble transition metal catalysts and accelerate biocompatible cyclopropanation in vivo. Overall, this work demonstrates that these surfactants hold great promise for \u2026",
                "A concise and efficient synthesis of (\u2212)\u2010gephyrotoxin from L\u2010pyroglutaminol has been realized. The key step in this approach is a diastereoselective intramolecular enamine\/Michael cascade reaction that forms two rings and two stereocenters and generates a stable tricyclic iminium cation. A hydroxy\u2010directed reduction of this intermediate plays a key role in establishing the required cis\u2010decahydroquinoline ring system, enabling the total synthesis of (\u2212)\u2010gephyrotoxin in nine steps and 14\u2009% overall yield. The absolute configuration of the synthetic material was confirmed by single\u2010crystal X\u2010ray diffraction and is consistent with the structure originally proposed for material isolated from the natural source.",
                "The use of organic chemistry principles and prediction techniques has enabled the development of new bioorthogonal reactions. As this \u201ctoolbox\u201d expands to include new reaction manifolds and orthogonal reaction pairings, the continued development of existing reactions remains an important objective. This is particularly important in cellular imaging, where non-specific background fluorescence has been linked to the hydrophobicity of the bioorthogonal moiety. Here we report that trans-5-oxocene (oxoTCO) displays enhanced reactivity and hydrophilicity compared to trans-cyclooctene (TCO) in the tetrazine ligation reaction. Aided by ab initio calculations we show that the insertion of a single oxygen atom into the trans-cyclooctene (TCO) ring system is sufficient to impart aqueous solubility and also results in significant rate acceleration by increasing angle strain. We demonstrate the rapid and quantitative \u2026",
                "The structural manipulation of small molecule metabolites occurs in all organisms and plays a fundamental role in essentially all biological processes. Despite an increasing interest in developing new, non-enzymatic chemical reactions capable of functioning in the presence of living organisms, the ability of such transformations to interface with cellular metabolism and influence biological function is a comparatively underexplored area of research. This review will discuss efforts to combine non-enzymatic chemistry with microbial metabolism. We will highlight recent and historical uses of non-biological reactions to study microbial growth and function, the use of non-enzymatic transformations to rescue auxotrophic microorganisms, and the combination of engineered microbial metabolism and biocompatible chemical reactions for organic synthesis."
