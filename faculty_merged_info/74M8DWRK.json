                "We attempt a comprehensive review of all published research in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) performed with the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer since the first work was reported in the mid-1980s. The SQUID is the most sensitive detector of magnetic flux known. The energy sensitivity of the SQUID may make it the most sensitive detector of any kind. The research on SQUIDs for NDE is based on the promise of that sensitivity and on the various other desirable properties developed for SQUID instrumentation in biomagnetism and other fields. The sensitivity of SQUID instruments down to very low frequencies allows them to function as eddy-current sensors with unparalleled depth resolution, and to image the static magnetization of paramagnetic materials and the flow of near-dc corrosion currents. The wide dynamic range of the SQUID makes it possible to image defects in \u2026",
                "In this paper, a new method for optimum coordination of overcurrent relays is proposed. The proposed method is based on only constraints. Minimization is inherently included by setting the time dials to minimum and increasing their values gradually. Configuration changes of the network are taken into account. The method does not need any initial solution. It can consider both linear and nonlinear relay characteristics models. The optimal settings of overcurrent relays for 8-Bus and England Norweb networks are obtained and comparison between the new method and existing methods is made."

                "Dr. Seyed Sadeghi Dr. Seyed Sadeghi Associate Professor, Seyed Sadeghi received his PhD in 1999 from the University of British Colombia and MSc from the University of Toronto in 1993. He was a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto before joining industry in 2001, as a materials and laser designer. In the year of 2005-2007 he was with McMaster University as senior research scientist before joining UAH as a faculty member in 2007. His research interest include nanophotonics, energy transfer in hybrid inorganic-biological nanostructures, plasmonic devices, and applications of quantum mechanical processes for device applications. He has published more than 118 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals regarding quantum optics of nanostructures, nanosensors, quantum devices, plasmonics, and quantum coherence processes in atomically thin semiconductor structures.
