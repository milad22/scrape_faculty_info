                "Progress in semiconductor technology has enabled the fabrication of structures so small that they can contain just one mobile electron. By varying controllably the number of electrons in these'artificial atoms' and measuring the energy required to add successive electrons, one can conduct atomic physics experiments in a regime that is inaccessible to experiments on real atoms.",
                "A van der Waals heterostructure is a type of metamaterial that consists of vertically stacked two-dimensional building blocks held together by the van der Waals forces between the layers. This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials 1. One such property is the \u2018twist\u2019angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moir\u00e9 pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order. So far, studies of the effects of the twist angle in van der Waals heterostructures have \u2026",
                "van der Waals heterostructures constitute a new class of artificial materials formed by stacking atomically thin planar crystals. We demonstrated band structure engineering in a van der Waals heterostructure composed of a monolayer graphene flake coupled to a rotationally aligned hexagonal boron nitride substrate. The spatially varying interlayer atomic registry results in both a local breaking of the carbon sublattice symmetry and a long-range moir\u00e9 superlattice potential in the graphene. In our samples, this interplay between short- and long-wavelength effects resulted in a band structure described by isolated superlattice minibands and an unexpectedly large band gap at charge neutrality. This picture is confirmed by our observation of fractional quantum Hall states at \u00b153 filling and features associated with the Hofstadter butterfly at ultrahigh magnetic fields.",
                "A two-dimensional electronic system forms at the interface between the band insulators 1, 2 LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3. Samples fabricated until now have been found to be either magnetic or superconducting, depending on growth conditions 3, 4. Combining high-resolution magnetic torque magnetometry and transport measurements, we report here magnetization measurements providing direct evidence of magnetic ordering of the two-dimensional electron liquid at the interface. The magnetic ordering exists from well below the superconducting transition to up to 200 K, and is characterized by an in-plane magnetic moment. Surprisingly, despite the presence of this magnetic ordering, the interface superconducts below 120 mK. This is unusual because conventional superconductivity rarely exists in magnetically ordered metals 5, 6. Our results suggest that there is either phase separation or coexistence between \u2026",
                "Using single-electron capacitance spectroscopy, we map the magnetic field dependence of the ground state energies of a single quantum dot containing from 0 to 50 electrons. The experimental spectra reproduce many features of a noninteracting electron model with an added fixed charging energy. However, in detailed observations deviations are apparent: Exchange induces a two-electron singlet-triplet transition, self-consistency of the confinement potential causes the dot to assume a quasi-two-dimensional character, and features develop which are suggestive of the fractional quantum Hall effect.",
                "We observe the capacitance signal resulting from single electrons tunneling into discrete quantum levels. The electrons tunnel between a metallic layer and confined states of a single disk in a microscopic capacitor fabricated in GaAs. Charge transfer occurs only for bias voltages at which a quantum level resonates with the Fermi energy of the metallic layer. This creates a sequence of distinct capacitance peaks whose bias positions directly reflect the electronic spectrum of the confined structure. From the magnetic field evolution of the spectrum, we deduce the nature of the bound states.",
                "We have studied edge magnetoplasmons (EMP\u2019s) created by pulses of 100 ps width in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, using a cryogenic transistor. We find that magnetoplasmon motion along the edge occurs only in the direction expected for negatively charged electrons; there is no hint of propagation in the opposite direction expected for positively charged quasiholes. We also measure the periods and decay rates of the edge modes continuously as a function of the magnetic field. From these characteristics we deduce the width of the EMP boundary layer as well as the magnetic-field-dependent momentum-relaxation time.",
                "Low-dimensional electronic systems have traditionally been obtained by electrostatically confining electrons, either in heterostructures or in intrinsically nanoscale materials such as single molecules, nanowires and graphene. Recently, a new method has emerged with the recognition that symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases 1, 2, which occur in systems with an energy gap to quasiparticle excitations (such as insulators or superconductors), can host robust surface states that remain gapless as long as the relevant global symmetry remains unbroken. The nature of the charge carriers in SPT surface states is intimately tied to the symmetry of the bulk, resulting in one-and two-dimensional electronic systems with novel properties. For example, time reversal symmetry endows the massless charge carriers on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, fixing the orientation of their spin \u2026",
                "The unusual properties of two-dimensional electron systems that give rise to the quantum Hall effect have prompted the development of new microscopic models for electrical conduction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The bulk properties of the quantum Hall effect have also been studied experimentally using a variety of probes including transport 7, 8, photoluminescence 9, 10, magnetization 11 and capacitance 12, 13 measurements. However, the fact that two-dimensional electron systems typically exist some distance (about 1,000 \u00c5) beneath the surface of the host semiconductor has presented an important obstacle to more direct measurements of microscopic electronic structure in the quantum Hall regime. Here we introduce a cryogenic scanning-probe technique\u2014\u2018subsurface charge accumulation\u2019imaging\u2014that permits very high resolution examination of systems of mobile electrons inside materials. We use this technique to \u2026",
                "Increases in the gate capacitance of field-effect transistor structures allow the production of lower-power devices that are compatible with higher clock rates, driving the race for developing high-\u03ba dielectrics. However, many-body effects in an electronic system can also enhance capacitance. Onto the electron system that forms at the LaAlO3\/SrTiO3 interface, we fabricated top-gate electrodes that can fully deplete the interface of all mobile electrons. Near depletion, we found a greater than 40% enhancement of the gate capacitance. Using an electric-field penetration measurement method, we show that this capacitance originates from a negative compressibility of the interface electron system. Capacitance enhancement exists at room temperature and arises at low electron densities, in which disorder is strong and the in-plane conductance is much smaller than the quantum conductance."

Systems in which electrons exist purely in two or one dimensions and even small boxes (quantum dots) containing as few as one electron can now be produced with relative ease. While simple quantum mechanical calculations determine the motion of a single electron in such a confining structures, it is far from simple to understand the behavior of many trapped electrons. Not only do the electrons repel one another, they are indistinguishable. This fact, along with the principle that only one electron can exist in any quantum mechanical orbit, produces unusual and sometimes counterintuitive correlations in the motions of electrons. A graduate of the University of California at San Diego (B.A. 1984) and Cornell University (Ph.D. 1991), Professor Ashoori joined the MIT faculty in 1993, after serving as a postdoctoral member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1998 and full Professor in July 2004.
