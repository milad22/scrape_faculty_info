                "Historically, quasi-low-dimensional superconductors were considered as the main candidates to observe high-temperature superconductivity. For a discussion of the related exotic mechanisms of superconductivity, suggested by WA Little and VL Ginzburg, see a chapter by D. J\u00e9rome in this volume. Unfortunately, high-temperature superconductivity has not been discovered yet in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) and quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) organic materials. Nevertheless, very rich and, in many cases, unique physical properties of their metallic, superconducting, charge-and spin-density-wave phases allowed PM Chaikin to claim that the first organic superconductors,(TMTSF) 2X, are probably the most interesting electronic materials ever discovered. Our book welcomes a reader to a fascinating world of exotic condensed matter physics, low temperatures, and high and ultrahigh magnetic fields. It is written by \u2026",
                "The properties of type II Q 1D organic superconductors are investigated theoretically, with a focus on the effect of magnetic-field twisting of the electron orbits. It is shown that the orbital effect is insufficient to keep Hc2 finite at T= 0, and that the critical temperature increases as the magnetic field is increased beyond the pseudocritical level. This result is considered consistent with the experimental observations of Jerome (1982) and probably applicable (with some restrictions) to the case of a layered superconductor in a magnetic field parallel to the layers."
