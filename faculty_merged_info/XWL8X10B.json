                "The Giotto magnetometer experiment at comet Halley has for the first time provided magnetic field measurements in all the important spatial regions characterizing the front-side interaction between the solar-wind magnetoplasma and a cometary atmosphere. Upstream waves of cometary origin have been observed at distances of> 2\u00d7 10 6 km from the comet, both inbound and outbound. A cometary bow shock has been identified at 1.15\u00d7 10 6 km inbound on the dawn side and a thick quasi-parallel cometary bow shock outbound. A turbulent magnetosheath has been observed further inside. A magnetic pile-up region has been identified inside 1.35\u00d7 10 5 km, inbound, and 2.63\u00d7 10 5 km, outbound, with fields up to 57 and 65 nT, respectively. A cavity region with essentially zero magnetic field has been discovered, with a width of 8,500 km along the trajectory around closest approach.",
                "We use a global model of Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere to simulate the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) substorm challenge event of November 24, 1996. We compare our results to International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) ground magnetometer data, assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) polar cap potential and field aligned current patterns, Polar Visible Imaging System (VIS) estimates of the polar cap magnetic flux, GOES 8 geosynchronous magnetometer data, IMP 8 magnetometer data, and Geotail plasma and magnetic field data. We find generally good agreement between the simulation and the data. The modeled evolution of this substorm generally follows the phenomenological near\u2010Earth neutral line model. However, reconnection in the tail is very localized, which makes establishing a causal relation between tail dynamics and auroral \u2026",
                "We have used a newly developed, parallelized, global MHD magnetosphere\u2010ionosphere simulation model with a 400 RE long tail to study the evolution, structure, and dynamics of the distant magnetotail during extended periods of northward IMF. We find that the tail evolves to a nearly time stationary structure about one solar wind transit time after the IMF turns northward. Four regions of different magnetic topology can be distinguished which extend at least to the end of the simulation box at 400 RE. Besides lobe field lines and open solar wind field lines tailward of an X\u2010line, there is a broad boundary layer of closed field lines which we call the tail flank boundary layer (TFBL). Just inside the TFBL there is a region of closed field loops. Besides the X\u2010line we find two O\u2010lines which are enclosed by the closed field loops and are roughly aligned with the tail axis. Together they form a U shaped separator between the \u2026",
                "We have used our Global Geospace Circulation Model (GGCM) to simulate two time intervals that were proposed as the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Grand Challenge for modelers to investigate to what extent and accuracy models can predict the ionosphere's response to the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper we present comparisons of our GGCM with the comprehensive experimental study by Lyons [this issue] (which provided synoptic maps of the polar cap electrodynamics and particle precipitation) for the two time intervals, January 27, 1992, 1325\u20131715 UT and 1730\u20131930 UT. We find a very good agreement between the potential patterns predicted by our model and those obtained by the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure. We also find that the separatrix and cusp locations predicted by our model generally compare well with those \u2026",
                "THEMIS was launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. During the first seven months of the mission the five satellites coasted near their injection orbit to avoid differential precession in anticipation of orbit placement, which started in September 2007 and led to a commencement of the baseline mission in December 2007. During the coast phase the probes were put into a string-of-pearls configuration at 100 s of km to 2 RE along-track separations, which provided a unique view of the magnetosphere and enabled an unprecedented dataset in anticipation of the first tail season. In this paper we describe the first THEMIS substorm observations, captured during instrument commissioning on March 23, 2007. THEMIS measured the rapid expansion of the plasma sheet at a speed that is commensurate with the simultaneous expansion of the auroras on the \u2026",
                " We use a global numerical model of the interaction of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field with Earth's magnetosphere to study the formation process of Flux Transfer Events (FTEs) during strong southward IMF. We find that: (i) The model produces essentially all observational features expected for FTEs, in particular the bipolar signature of the magnetic field BN component, the correct polarity, duration, and intermittency of that bipolar signature, strong core fields and enhanced core pressure, and flow enhancements; (ii) FTEs only develop for large dipole tilt whereas in the case of no dipole tilt steady magnetic reconnection occurs at the dayside magnetopause; (iii) the basic process by which FTEs are produced is the sequential generation of new X-lines which makes dayside reconnection inherently time dependent and leads to a modified form of dual or multiple X-line reconnection; (iv) the FTE generation process in this model is not dependent on specific assumptions about microscopic processes; (v) the average period of FTEs can be explained by simple geometric arguments involving magnetosheath convection; (vi) FTEs do not develop in the model if the numerical resolution is too coarse leading to too much numerical diffusion; and (vii) FTEs for nearly southward IMF and large dipole tilt, i.e., near solstice, should only develop in the winter hemisphere, which provides a testable prediction of seasonal modulation. The semiannual modulation of intermittent FTE reconnection versus steady reconnection is also expected to modulate magnetospheric and ionospheric convection and may thus contribute to the semiannual variation \u2026",
                "The THEMIS mission provides unprecedented multi-point observations of the magnetosphere in conjunction with an equally unprecedented dense network of ground measurements. However, coverage of the magnetosphere is still sparse. In order to tie together the THEMIS observations and to understand the data better, we will use the Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), a global model of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. OpenGGCM solves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the outer magnetosphere and couples via field aligned current (FAC), electric potential, and electron precipitation to a ionosphere potential solver and the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Model (CTIM). The OpenGGCM thus provides a global comprehensive view of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. An OpenGGCM simulation of one of the first substorms observed by THEMIS on \u2026",
                "We have used a new high\u2010resolution global magnetohydrodynamic simulation model to investigate the onset of reconnection in the magnetotail during intervals with southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). After the southward IMF reaches the dayside magnetopause reconnection begins and magnetic flux is convected into the tail lobes. After about 35 min, reconnection begins within the plasma sheet near midnight at x = \u221214RE. Later the x line moves toward dawn and dusk. The reconnection occurs just tailward of the region where the tail attaches onto the dipole\u2010dominated inner magnetosphere. The simulation shows that prior to the onset of reconnection, the Poynting flux is concentrated in this region. The time required for the start of reconnection depends on the component of the magnetic field normal to the equator (BZ). Reconnection occurs only after the BZ component has been reduced sufficiently for \u2026",
                "We compare four explanations of transpolar potential saturation: (1) the magnetic field at the stagnation point weakens, thereby limiting magnetic reconnection; (2) a dimple develops at the stagnation point, which limits the inflow rate to the reconnection line; (3) the magnetopause becomes blunt and the bow shock recedes, thus giving more room for the solar wind to flow around the magnetosphere, thereby reducing the need for magnetic reconnection; (4) the region 1 current system usurps the Chapman\u2010Ferraro current system and saturates when the J \u00d7 B force it generates balances solar wind ram pressure. The paper's point is that all four mechanisms involve a limit on the strength of the region 1 current system and that the criterion for the onset of transpolar potential saturation in each mechanism is that the region 1 current system generates a magnetic field that is about as strong as the dipole field at the dayside \u2026",
                "We present Geotail plasma and field observations from the middle magnetotail near XGSE=\u221246 RE for the time period 1400 to 1800 UT on December 14, 1994. During that period, the Wind satellite monitored the solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) upstream of the bow shock. The IMF was northward and the plasma parameters near average. Geotail observed slow tailward flows and a northward field. The plasma and field parameters indicate that Geotail is either in the plasma sheet or in a boundary layer. We used the Wind solar wind plasma and IMF data as input for a global simulation of that time interval. Comparison of the simulation results with the observational data show very good overall agreement of the magnitudes of the plasma and field parameters. In particular, the simulation reproduces the slow tailward flows and northward field found at Geotail. Small scale temporal variations are \u2026"
