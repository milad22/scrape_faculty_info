                "In this paper we show how a solution of BSDE can be reflected by a very irregular L2-obstacle. We prove that this problem is equivalent to find the smallest g-supermartingale of BSDE that dominates this obstacle. We then obtain the existence and uniqueness and continuous dependence theorem for this reflected BSDE. We also consider the problem of existence and uniqueness of reflected BSDE with double L2 obstacles, by using a penalization method. A new monotonic limit theorem is developed to prove the convergence of the penalization sequence, and to prove the existence theorem. We also prove that this reflected BSDE with double obstacles is equivalent to a problem of the smallest g-supermartingale and the largest g-submartingale.\uf6d9 2005 Elsevier SAS.
