                "The pursuit of better atomic clocks has advanced many research areas, providing better quantum state control, new insights in quantum science, tighter limits on fundamental constant variation and improved tests of relativity. The record for the best stability and accuracy is currently held by optical lattice clocks. Here we take an important step towards realizing the full potential of a many-particle clock with a state-of-the-art stable laser. Our 87 Sr optical lattice clock now achieves fractional stability of 2.2\u00d7 10\u2212 16 at 1 s. With this improved stability, we perform a new accuracy evaluation of our clock, reducing many systematic uncertainties that limited our previous measurements, such as those in the lattice ac Stark shift, the atoms\u2019 thermal environment and the atomic response to room-temperature blackbody radiation. Our combined measurements have reduced the total uncertainty of the JILA Sr clock to 2.1\u00d7 10\u2212 18 in \u2026",
                "This article reviews recent developments in tests of fundamental physics using atoms and molecules, including the subjects of parity violation, searches for permanent electric dipole moments, tests of the C P T theorem and Lorentz symmetry, searches for spatiotemporal variation of fundamental constants, tests of quantum electrodynamics, tests of general relativity and the equivalence principle, searches for dark matter, dark energy, and extra forces, and tests of the spin-statistics theorem. Key results are presented in the context of potential new physics and in the broader context of similar investigations in other fields. Ongoing and future experiments of the next decade are discussed.",
                "Atomic polarization phenomena impinge upon a number of areas and processes in physics. The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave \u2026",
                "The van der Waals coefficients for the alkali-metal atoms from Na to Fr interacting in their ground states are calculated using relativistic ab initio methods. The accuracy of the calculations is estimated by also evaluating atomic static electric-dipole polarizabilities and coefficients for the interaction of the atoms with a perfectly conducting wall. The results are in excellent agreement with the latest data from studies of magnetic field induced Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions of Na and of Rb atoms. For Cs we provide critically needed data for ultracold collision studies.",
                "Removal energies and hyperfine constants of the lowest four n s, np 1\/2, and np 3\/2 states in Na, K, Rb, and Cs are calculated; removal energies of the n= 7\u201310 states and hyperfine constants of the n= 7 and 8 states in Fr are also calculated. The calculations are based on the relativistic single-double (SD) approximation in which single and double excitations of Dirac-Hartree-Fock wave functions are included to all orders in perturbation theory. Using SD wave functions, accurate values of removal energies, electric-dipole matrix elements, and static polarizabilities are obtained; however, SD wave functions give poor values of the magnetic-dipole hyperfine constants for heavy atoms. To obtain accurate values of the hyperfine constants for heavy atoms, we include triple excitations partially in the wave functions. The present calculations provide the basis for reevaluating parity nonconserving amplitudes in Cs and Fr.",
                "SU(N) symmetry can emerge in a quantum system with N single-particle spin states when spin is decoupled from interparticle interactions. Taking advantage of the high measurement precision offered by an ultrastable laser, we report a spectroscopic observation of SU(N \u2264 10) symmetry in 87Sr. By encoding the electronic orbital degree of freedom in two clock states while keeping the system open to as many as 10 nuclear spin sublevels, we probed the non-equilibrium two-orbital SU(N) magnetism via Ramsey spectroscopy of atoms confined in an array of two-dimensional optical traps; we studied the spin-orbital quantum dynamics and determined the relevant interaction parameters. This study lays the groundwork for using alkaline-earth atoms as testbeds for important orbital models.",
                "Energies of the ten (2l2 l\u2032) states of ions of the beryllium isoelectronic sequence are determined to second order in relativistic many-body perturbation theory. Both the second-order Coulomb interaction and the second-order Breit-Coulomb interaction are included. Corrections for the frequency-dependent Breit interaction are taken into account in lowest order only. The effect of the Lamb shift is also estimated and included. Comparison with experiment and other theoretical data is made.\u00a9 1996 The American Physical Society.",
                "Electric-dipole matrix elements for ns\u2212 n\u2032 p, nd\u2212 n\u2032 p, and 6 d\u2212 4 f transitions in Rb are calculated using a relativistic all-order method. A third-order calculation is also carried out for these matrix elements to evaluate the importance of the high-order many-body perturbation theory contributions. The all-order matrix elements are used to evaluate lifetimes of ns and np levels with n= 6, 7, 8 and nd levels with n= 4, 5, 6 for comparison with experiment and to provide benchmark values for these lifetimes. The dynamic polarizabilities are calculated for ns states of rubidium. The resulting lifetime and polarizability values are compared with available theory and experiment.",
                "We report measurements of the lifetimes of the 3 d D 5\u2215 2 2 and 3 d D 3\u2215 2 2 metastable states of a single laser-cooled Ca+ 40 ion in a linear Paul trap. We introduce a measurement technique based on high-efficiency quantum state detection after coherent excitation to the D 5\u2215 2 state or incoherent shelving in the D 3\u2215 2 state, and subsequent free, unperturbed spontaneous decay. The result for the natural lifetime of the D 5\u2215 2 state of 1168 (9) ms agrees excellently with the most precise published value. The lifetime of the D 3\u2215 2 state is measured with a single ion and yields 1176 (11) ms which improves the statistical uncertainty of previous results by a factor of four. We compare these experimental lifetimes to high-precision ab initio all order calculations [D 3\u2215 2 state: 1196 (11) ms; D 5\u2215 2 state: 1165 (11) ms] and find a very good agreement. These calculations represent an excellent test of high-precision \u2026"
