                "The paper introduces a set of formative assessment tasks and rubrics that were developed for use in an introductory physics instruction to help students acquire and self-assess various scientific process abilities. We will describe the rubrics, tasks, and the student outcomes in courses where the tasks and rubrics were used.",
                "The Extended Physics courses at Rutgers University provide a successful alternative to the traditional introductory physics classes for students at risk of failure. The authors discuss methods for addressing at-risk factors in introductory physics and how they implement them. They then offer recommendations for creating an effective program within the structure of a research university.",
                "University students taking introductory physics are generally successful executing mathematical procedures in context, but often struggle with the use of mathematical concepts for sense making. Physics instructors note that their students experience difficulty with basic algebraic reasoning, a foundation on which more advanced mathematical thinking rests. However, little systematic research has been done to measure and categorize such difficulties in this population. This paper describes an investigation of trends in student reasoning with proportions, quantification, and symbolizing in introductory calculus-based physics. Although the assessment items used to probe student thinking require mathematical reasoning typically taught at the middle school level in mathematics courses, we find success rates of about 50% among calculus-based physics students. For many of these students, numerical complexity and the level of abstraction of the quantities interfere with basic arithmetic reasoning. We argue that the algebraic thinking of physicists stems from an idiosyncratic cognitive blend, which is not addressed in prerequisite algebra courses. We suggest that for more students to understand and adopt the mathematical thinking characteristic of physics, instructors and education researchers must explore how to make mathematization a more explicit part of the curriculum."

                "Suzanne White Brahmia Assistant Professor brahmia@uw.edu 206-616-7768 C224 Physics Education Biography My primary research area is mathematization in physics: Novice-to-expert transition, Quantification, Proportional Reasoning, Negativity, Symbolizing, Covariational reasoning, Inventing with Contrasting Cases. I am also currently exploring the impacts of Assessable Learning Objectives (ALOs) on teaching and learning: Standardizing ALOs across the introductory curriculum, Impact of ALOs on student learning and on faculty practices. See my professional page for more detail on these and other areas in which I am, or have been, active.\u200b Physics Education Group (PEG) This work started as a discussion between\u00a0Steve Kanim,\u00a0Suzanne White Brahmia\u00a0and\u00a0Andrew Boudreaux\u00a0who had all been trying independently to better understand students' reasoning about proportions and who were developing curricular materials to help their students develop better mathematical reasoning skills. We believe that what is typically thought of as student learning in physics is actually just the tip an iceberg with a much larger base of mathematical sensemaking that is largely unseen and under-assessed as we invite our students to learn the practices of physics.
