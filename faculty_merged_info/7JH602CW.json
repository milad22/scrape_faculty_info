                "Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 \u03bcm), H (1.65 \u03bcm), and K s (2.16 \u03bcm) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 \u03c3 point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and K s bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 \u03c3 photometric uncertainty of< 0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are< 0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million \u2026",
                "The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) project is designed to close the gap between our current technical capability and our knowledge of the near-infrared sky. In addition to providing a context for the interpretation of results obtained at infrared and other wavelengths, 2MASS will provide direct answers to immediate questions on the large-scale structure of the Milky Way and the Local Universe.",
                "Before the 2\u2010Micron All\u2010Sky Survey (2MASS) began, only six objects were known with spectral types later than M9.5 V. In the first 371 deg2 of actual 2MASS survey data, we have identified another 20 such objects spectroscopically confirmed using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Because the TiO and VO bands, which dominate the far\u2010optical portions of late\u2010M spectra, disappear in these cooler dwarfs, we define a new spectral class \u201cL\u201d in which metallic oxides are replaced by metallic hydrides and neutral alkali metals as the major spectroscopic signatures. We establish classification indices and type all 25 L dwarfs. The 26th \u201cpost\u2010M9.5\u201d object\u2014Gl 229B\u2014is the prototype of a methane\u2010dominated spectral class, which we propose as class \u201cT.\u201d At least five of the 20 2MASS L dwarfs show the 6708 \u00c5 lithium doublet at low resolution, the strongest having an equivalent \u2026",
