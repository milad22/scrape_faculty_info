                "Electrons in correlated insulators are prevented from conducting by Coulomb repulsion between them. When an insulator-to-metal transition is induced in a correlated insulator by doping or heating, the resulting conducting state can be radically different from that characterized by free electrons in conventional metals. We report on the electronic properties of a prototypical correlated insulator vanadium dioxide in which the metallic state can be induced by increasing temperature. Scanning near-field infrared microscopy allows us to directly image nanoscale metallic puddles that appear at the onset of the insulator-to-metal transition. In combination with far-field infrared spectroscopy, the data reveal the Mott transition with divergent quasi-particle mass in the metallic puddles. The experimental approach used sets the stage for investigations of charge dynamics on the nanoscale in other inhomogeneous correlated \u2026",
                "This volume of the Handbook adds five new chapters to the science of rare earths. Two of the chapters deal with intermetallic compounds. An overview of ternary systems containing rare earths, transition metals and indium\u2013Chapter 218\u2013opens the volume. It is followed by Chapter 219 sorting out relationships between superconductivity and magnetism. The next two chapters are dedicated to complex compounds of rare earths: Chapter 220 describes structural studies using circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy of lanthanide systems, while Chapter 221 examines rare-earth metal-organic frameworks, also known as coordination polymers. The final Chapter 222 deals with the catalytic activity of rare earths in site-selective hydrolysis of DNA and RNA.",
                "Muon-spin-relaxation and bulk measurements of the magnetic-field penetration depth suggest that the cuprate high-T c, bismuthate, organic Chevrel-phase, and heavy-fermion systems possibly belong to a unique group of superconductors characterized by high transition temperatures T c relative to the values of n s\/m*(carrier density\/effective mass). This feature distinguishes these exotic superconductors from ordinary BCS superconductors.",
                "Transport, thermal, and magnetic data for the heavy electron system URu 2 Si 2 indicate that a charge-or spin-density-wave transition opens an energy gap of\u223c 11 meV over a portion of the Fermi surface below T 0\u224a 17.5 K and demonstrate that bulk superconductivity occurs below T c\u224a 1.5 K. The pressure dependences of T 0 and T c support this interpretation. The unusually large initial slope of the upper critical magnetic field (9.2 T\/K) is consistent with the high values of the electronic-specific-heat coefficient and the electrical resistivity.",
                "Superconductivity has been observed in PrOs 4 Sb 12 at T C= 1.85 K and appears to involve heavy fermion quasiparticles with an effective mass m*\u223c 50 m e as inferred from the jump in the specific heat at T C, the upper critical field near T C, and the normal state electronic specific heat. Thermodynamic and transport measurements suggest that the heavy fermion state has a quadrupolar origin, although a magnetic origin cannot be completely ruled out.",
                "The compound Er Rh 4 B 4 becomes superconducting at a critical temperature T c 1 of 8.7 K followed by a return to the normal state at a second critical temperature T c 2 of 0.9 K. The return to the normal state at T c 2 is coincident with the occurrence of long-range ordering of the magnetic moments of the Er 3+ ions which completely occupy a set of equivalent lattice sites.",
                "Josephson tunneling currents have been observed on low leakage Pb\/insulator\/Y 1\u2212 x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 tunnel junctions. The junctions are planar with tunneling into the c axis. We have studied these Josephson currents on junctions with resistances varying by more than 2 orders of magnitude. From the magnetic field modulation of the Josephson current, the low temperature value and the temperature dependence from 1.3 to 4.2 K of the c-axis penetration depth were measured. This observation of Josephson coupling along the c axis between a conventional superconductor (Pb) and a cuprate raises questions about the proposed d-wave nature of the superconducting order parameter in the cuprates.",
                "Filled skutterudite antimonides 1, 2 are cubic compounds with the formula RM 4 Sb 12, where R is a rare-earth element (such as La or Ce), and M is a transition metal (for example, Fe or Co). The rare-earth ion is weakly bound in an oversized atomic cage formed by the other atoms. Its presence has been shown to cause a dramatic reduction in the lattice component of the thermal conductivity, while having little effect on the electronic properties 3, 4, 5 of the compound. This combination of properties makes filled skutterudites of interest as thermoelectric materials. It has been suggested 4 that localized, incoherent vibrations of the rare-earth ion are responsible for the reduction in thermal conductivity, but no direct evidence for these local vibrational modes exists. Here we report the observation of local modes in La-filled skutterudites, using heat capacity, elastic constant and inelastic neutron scattering measurements \u2026",
                "A crossover with decreasing temperature T from localized moment magnetism to heavy Fermi liquid behavior is reported for the metallic compound LiV 2 O 4 with the fcc normal-spinel structure. At T= 1 K, the electronic heat capacity coefficient \u03b3\u2248 0.42 J\/mol K 2 is exceptionally large for a transition metal compound, the Wilson ratio\u2248 1.7, and the Korringa ratio\u2248 0.7. Our sample with the lowest level of paramagnetic defects showed no static magnetic order above 0.02 K. Superconductivity was not observed above 0.01 K.",
                "We present measurements of electrical resitivity \u03c1 (T), specific heat C (T), entropy S (T), and magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 (T) as functions of temperature T for the alloy system Y 1\u2212 x U x Pd 3. For x= 0.2, \u03c1 (T)\/\u03c1 (0) is almost linear in T for 0.2\u2264 T\u2264 20 K, and C (T)\/T\u223c-ln (\u03b1T) for 0.6< T< 16 K. Also, the added molar entropy per U, \u0394S (T)-\u0394S (0) appears to saturate to (R\/2) ln (2), suggesting that \u0394S (0)\u224a(R\/2) ln (2). We argue that our data provide comprehensive evidence in a dilute alloy for the two-channel quadrupolar Kondo effect (T K\u224a 42 K) with concomitant \u2018\u2018marginal Fermi liquid\u2019\u2019phenomenology."

D., UC San Diego, 1969 Office: MH 1230 Phone: 858-534-3968 bmaple@physics.ucsd.edu As an experimentalist working in the area of condensed matter physics, I am interested in strongly correlated electron phenomena in novel d- and f-electron materials. These phenomena include superconductivity, magnetism, and effects arising from their interplay, heavy fermion behavior, and non-Fermi liquid behavior. I am especially interested in unconventional superconductivity that occurs in cuprates in which the superconducting critical temperature Tc attains values as high as ~ 130 K and heavy fermion materials in which Tc ~ 1 K. Heavy fermion materials are compounds of rare earth or actinide ions with partially-filled f-electron shells (e.g., Ce, Yb, U) in which the conduction electrons have effective masses as large as several hundred times the free electron mass. It is widely believed that the unconventional superconductivity found in these two classes of materials involves pairing of electrons, mediated by spin fluctuations, in states with angular momentum greater than zero (p- or d-wave superconductivity). Recently, superconductivity with Tc = 1.85 K in the filled skutterudite compound PrOs4Sb12, the first heavy fermion superconductor based on Pr, was discovered in our laboratory at the University of California, San Diego. There is evidence for triplet-spin (p-wave) pairing of superconducting electrons in PrOs4Sb12, which may be mediated by electric quadrupole fluctuations, rather than spin fluctuations. I also have a strong interest is non-Fermi liquid behavior and other exotic states, such as unconventional superconductivity, that are found in d- and f-electron materials in the vicinity of quantum critical points, values of a control parameter such as composition, pressure, or magnetic field where a second order phase transition is suppressed to 0 K."
