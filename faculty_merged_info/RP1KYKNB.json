Specific studies include: Studies of electrode-electrolyte interfaces, including electron transfer and the electronic structure of oxides and metals with applications to electrolysis and catalysis in nanophase as well as macroscopic systems. Studies of solvation, transport and ion pairing in polymers and ionic liquids of relevance to batteries and fuel cells. Studies of the interaction of vapor pulses with Bose-Einstein condensed helium four liquid and alkali gases. Chemical kinetic studies of models of prebiotic evolution. video of a simulation of one of the models Fellow, American Physical Society, 1998 Fellow of the Supercomputer Institute, University of Minnesota,1989-present Graduate Faculty of Materials Science, University of Minnesota,1989- 2012 IBM Paul J.
