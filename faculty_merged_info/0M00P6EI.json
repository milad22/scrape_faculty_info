We are largely an experimental group focusing on new physics in the neutrino sector. In the near term, we are working on the ArgoNeuT, LArIAT, MicroBooNE, and SBND experiments at Fermilab. In the long term, we are pursuing searches for CP Violation in the neutrino sector with the DUNE experiment.\u00a0 Concurrently, we are developing the next generation of accelerator neutrino detectors for these programs \u2013 Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers.
