                "The superposition of quantum states drives motion on the atomic and subatomic scales, with the energy spacing of the states dictating the speed of the motion. In the case of electrons residing in the outer (valence) shells of atoms and molecules which are separated by electronvolt energies, this means that valence electron motion occurs on a subfemtosecond to few-femtosecond timescale (1 fs= 10\u2212 15 s). In the absence of complete measurements, the motion can be characterized in terms of a complex quantity, the density matrix. Here we report an attosecond pump\u2013probe measurement of the density matrix of valence electrons in atomic krypton ions 1. We generate the ions with a controlled few-cycle laser field 2 and then probe them through the spectrally resolved absorption of an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse 3, which allows us to observe in real time the subfemtosecond motion of valence electrons over a \u2026",
                "The rapidly growing field of nanoscale lasers can be advanced through the discovery of new, tunable light sources. The emission wavelength tunability demonstrated in perovskite materials is an attractive property for nanoscale lasers. Whereas organic\u2013inorganic lead halide perovskite materials are known for their instability, cesium lead halides offer a robust alternative without sacrificing emission tunability or ease of synthesis. Here, we report the low-temperature, solution-phase growth of cesium lead halide nanowires exhibiting low-threshold lasing and high stability. The as-grown nanowires are single crystalline with well-formed facets, and act as high-quality laser cavities. The nanowires display excellent stability while stored and handled under ambient conditions over the course of weeks. Upon optical excitation, Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot lasing occurs in CsPbBr3 nanowires with an onset of 5 \u03bcJ cm\u22122 with the nanowire \u2026",
                "Electron transfer from valence to conduction band states in semiconductors is the basis of modern electronics. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy is used to resolve this process in silicon in real time. Electrons injected into the conduction band by few-cycle laser pulses alter the silicon XUV absorption spectrum in sharp steps synchronized with the laser electric field oscillations. The observed ~450-attosecond step rise time provides an upper limit for the carrier-induced band-gap reduction and the electron-electron scattering time in the conduction band. This electronic response is separated from the subsequent band-gap modifications due to lattice motion, which occurs on a time scale of 60 \u00b1 10 femtoseconds, characteristic of the fastest optical phonon. Quantum dynamical simulations interpret the carrier injection step as light-field\u2013induced electron tunneling.",
                "Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of brightly emitting colloidal cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) nanowires (NWs) with uniform diameters and tunable compositions. By using highly monodisperse CsPbBr3 NWs as templates, the NW composition can be independently controlled through anion-exchange reactions. CsPbX3 alloy NWs with a wide range of alloy compositions can be achieved with well-preserved morphology and crystal structure. The NWs are highly luminescent with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) ranging from 20% to 80%. The bright photoluminescence can be tuned over nearly the entire visible spectrum. The high PLQYs together with charge transport measurements exemplify the efficient alloying of the anionic sublattice in a one-dimensional CsPbX3 system. The wires increased functionality in the form of fast photoresponse rates and the low defect density suggest \u2026",
                "Time and wavelength\u2010resolved infrared fluorescence techniques are used to study the photofragmentation dynamics of CH2I2 and CH3I at the excimer laser wavelengths of 248 and 308 nm. Emission is detected from vibrationally excited CH2I and CH3 radicals as well as from the excited iodine atoms [I*(2P1\/2\u21922P3\/2)] produced in the photolysis. A complete infrared fluorescence spectrum of the highly excited CH2I radical is obtained as a function of time after the 248 nm dissociating laser pulse, providing both spectroscopic and vibrational deactivation data for the radical. Significant CH2I emission is observed at all wavelengths, indicating that excitation occurs into a very high density of states, nearing the vibrational quasicontinuum. Stronger emission features are observed in the region of the C\u2013H stretching vibrations, the CH2 bending motion, and a combination band of these two modes. Deactivation rates for \u2026",
                "The generation of chemical fuel in the form of molecular H2 via the electrolysis of water is regarded to be a promising approach to convert incident solar power into an energy storage medium. Highly efficient and cost-effective catalysts are required to make such an approach practical on a large scale. Recently, a number of amorphous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts have emerged that show promise in terms of scalability and reactivity, yet remain poorly understood. In this work, we utilize Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as a tool to elucidate the structure and function of an amorphous cobalt sulfide (CoSx) catalyst. Ex situ measurements reveal that the as-deposited CoSx catalyst is composed of small clusters in which the cobalt is surrounded by both sulfur and oxygen. Operando experiments, performed while the CoSx is catalyzing the HER, yield a molecular model in \u2026",
                "We present a method of producing single attosecond pulses by high-harmonic generation with multicycle driver laser pulses. This can be achieved by tailoring the driving pulse so that attosecond pulses are produced only every full cycle of the oscillating laser field rather than every half-cycle. It is shown by classical and quantum-mechanical model calculations that even a minor addition (1%) of phase-locked second-harmonic light to the 800 nm fundamental driver pulse for high-harmonic generation leads to a major (15%) difference in the maximum kinetic energies of the recombining electrons in adjacent half-cycles.",
                "Sequential multiple photoionization of the prototypical molecule N 2 is studied with femtosecond time resolution using the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). A detailed picture of intense x-ray induced ionization and dissociation dynamics is revealed, including a molecular mechanism of frustrated absorption that suppresses the formation of high charge states at short pulse durations. The inverse scaling of the average target charge state with x-ray peak brightness has possible implications for single-pulse imaging applications.",
                "The dissociation of excited state Br 2 is probed with the novel technique of ultrafast soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Excited Br 2 molecules are prepared in the dissociative \u03a0 u 1 state with 80 fs, 400 nm pulses, and a series of photoelectron spectra are obtained during dissociation with pulses of soft x-ray light (47 nm, 26.4 eV, 250 fs). The formation of Br atoms is readily detected and the data support an extremely fast dissociation time for Br 2 on the order of 40 fs. Amplitudes of the pump-probe features reveal that the ionization cross section of atomic Br at 47 nm is\u223c 40 times larger than that of Br 2.",
                "Helium nanodroplets are considered ideal model systems to explore quantum hydrodynamics in self-contained, isolated superfluids. However, exploring the dynamic properties of individual droplets is experimentally challenging. In this work, we used single-shot femtosecond x-ray coherent diffractive imaging to investigate the rotation of single, isolated superfluid helium-4 droplets containing ~108 to 1011 atoms. The formation of quantum vortex lattices inside the droplets is confirmed by observing characteristic Bragg patterns from xenon clusters trapped in the vortex cores. The vortex densities are up to five orders of magnitude larger than those observed in bulk liquid helium. The droplets exhibit large centrifugal deformations but retain axially symmetric shapes at angular velocities well beyond the stability range of viscous classical droplets."

Current projects in attosecond physics are described here in more detail and follow along several main themes: Isolated attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region are used in time-resolved spectroscopy of atoms, molecules, and condensed matter. These isolated attosecond pulses are produced by high-order harmonic upconversion in a Ne gas target of a few-cycle near-infrared (NIR) pulse into the XUV spectral region. A new method of ionization gating allows the generation of energy-tunable isolated attosecond pulses, as opposed to the conventional amplitude gating method, which yields pulses with limited tunability. This increased energy tunability is critical for the application of isolated attosecond pulses to time-resolved spectroscopy. In addition, we have shown that scanning of the carrier-envelope phase allows rapid determination of the contrast ratio of the isolated attosecond pulse. A variety of complementary attosecond spectroscopic techniques are being pursued and developed in the Leone group. In the first method, initiation of ultrafast dynamics by the XUV isolated attosecond pulse is followed by streak-field detection of the photoelectrons. The dynamics of the various quantum states involved in the time-dependent evolution of the photoexcited state is encoded in the photoelectron spectrum collected as a function of time delay between the XUV pump pulse and the NIR streaking probe pulse. In addition to measuring the photoelectron kinetic energies by linear time-of-flight, photoelectron angular distributions can also be obtained via velocity map imaging. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry is also used to detect photofragments originating from dissociative ionization processes in polyatomics. In the second method, a few-cycle NIR pulse is used to drive plasmon oscillations in metallic nanostructures, thereby mapping the temporal phase of the oscillation to a kinetic energy modulation of the photoelectrons ejected by the isolated attosecond pulse. This method allows direct observation of plasmon decoherence in real time and paves the way for the rational design of plasmonic nanomaterials. In the third method, photoinitiation of coherent electron dynamics by a few-cycle ultraviolet to NIR pulse is followed by isolated attosecond probing of atomic core level absorptions in atoms and molecules. In addition to transient absorption, transient linear dispersion of a sample can also be measured and yields changes in the real part of the refractive index upon initial photoexcitation. For opaque condensed matter samples, transient reflectivity is employed as an alternative to transient absorption, thereby allowing the study of carrier dynamics in solid state nanomaterials on the attosecond time scale. Experiments are being explored in confocal microscopy, apertureless near field optical microscopy, and single pulse coherent anti-Stokes Raman microscopy with phase control, and studies involving quantum dot blinking and pump-probe ultrafast studies of semiconductor nanocrystals. Other projects study aerosol light scattering and spectroscopy, aerosol reactions, as well as surface probing of neutrals desorbed by scanning ion microprobes using the chemical dynamics beamline at the Advanced Light Source.
