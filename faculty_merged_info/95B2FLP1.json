                "A detailed analysis is given of chiral-symmetry breaking in the large-flavor (N) limit of quantum electrodynamics in (2+ 1) dimensions. Analytical and numerical solutions of the homogeneous Dyson-Schwinger equation for the fermion self-energy combined with a computation of the effective potential for the fermion bilinear show that it is energetically preferable for the theory to dynamically generate a mass for fermions. The magnitude of the mass is roughly exponentially suppressed in N from the fundamental dimensionful scale \u03b1\u2261 N e 2 of the gauge coupling constant, but the scale at which the self-mass begins to damp rapidly appears to be of order \u03b1, so that there is no spontaneous breaking of an approximate scale invariance that the underlying theory possesses at momentum small compared to \u03b1. Higher-order 1\/N corrections are analyzed and it is shown that the 1\/N expansion can be used consistently to \u2026",
                "We describe experimental investigations of the structure of two-dimensional spherical crystals. The crystals, formed by beads self-assembled on water droplets in oil, serve as model systems for exploring very general theories about the minimum-energy configurations of particles with arbitrary repulsive interactions on curved surfaces. Above a critical system size we find that crystals develop distinctive high-angle grain boundaries, or scars, not found in planar crystals. The number of excess defects in a scar is shown to grow linearly with the dimensionless system size. The observed slope is expected to be universal, independent of the microscopic potential.",
                "The production of strings (disclination lines and loops) has been observed by means of the Kibble mechanism of domain (bubble) formation in the isotropic-nematic phase transition of the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal 4-cyano-49-n-pentylbiphenyl. The number of strings formed per bubble is about 0.6. This value is in reasonable agreement with a numerical simulation of the experiment in which the Kibble mechanism is used for the order parameter space of a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal.",
                "Engineering synthetic materials that mimic the remarkable complexity of living organisms is a fundamental challenge in science and technology. We studied the spatiotemporal patterns that emerge when an active nematic film of microtubules and molecular motors is encapsulated within a shape-changing lipid vesicle. Unlike in equilibrium systems, where defects are largely static structures, in active nematics defects move spontaneously and can be described as self-propelled particles. The combination of activity, topological constraints, and vesicle deformability produces a myriad of dynamical states. We highlight two dynamical modes: a tunable periodic state that oscillates between two defect configurations, and shape-changing vesicles with streaming filopodia-like protrusions. These results demonstrate how biomimetic materials can be obtained when topological constraints are used to control the non \u2026",
                "Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its Gaussian curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics control the detailed structure of the ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the \u2026",
                "Liquid crystals inevitably possess topological defect excitations generated through boundary conditions, through applied fields, or in quenches to the ordered phase. In equilibrium, pairs of defects coarsen and annihilate as the uniform ground state is approached. Here we show that defects in active liquid crystals exhibit profoundly different behavior, depending on the degree of activity and its contractile or extensile character. While contractile systems enhance the annihilation dynamics of passive systems, extensile systems act to drive defects apart so that they swarm around in the manner of topologically well-characterized self-propelled particles. We develop a simple analytical model for the defect dynamics which reproduces the key features of both the numerical solutions and recent experiments on microtubule-kinesin assemblies.",
                "The behavior of ten-dimensional superstrings at high temperatures is studied by use of the microcanonical ensemble. We focus on closed superstring theories. The massive string excitations alone have negative specific heat. Such a system can reach equilibrium with the zero modes of the string if the energy carried by zero modes is less than a given fraction of the total energy. The temperature can then exceed the Hagedorn temperature. Some consequences for the evolution of the universe are discussed.",
                "We propose and analyze an effective free energy describing the physics of disclination defects in particle arrays constrained to move on an arbitrary two-dimensional surface. At finite temperature the physics of interacting disclinations is mapped to a Laplacian sine-Gordon Hamiltonian suitable for numerical simulations. We discuss general features of the ground state and thereafter specialize to the spherical case. The ground state is analyzed as a function of the ratio of the defect core energy to the Young\u2019s modulus. We argue that the core energy contribution becomes less and less important in the limit R\u226b a, where R is the radius of the sphere and a is the particle spacing. For large core energies there are 12 disclinations forming an icosahedron. For intermediate core energies unusual finite-length grain boundaries are preferred. The complicated regime of small core energies, appropriate to the limit R\/a\u2192\u221e, is \u2026"
