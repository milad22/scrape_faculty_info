                "We propose a robust wavelet domain method for noise filtering in medical images. The proposed method adapts itself to various types of image noise as well as to the preference of the medical expert; a single parameter can be used to balance the preservation of (expert-dependent) relevant details against the degree of noise reduction. The algorithm exploits generally valid knowledge about the correlation of significant image features across the resolution scales to perform a preliminary coefficient classification. This preliminary coefficient classification is used to empirically estimate the statistical distributions of the coefficients that represent useful image features on the one hand and mainly noise on the other. The adaptation to the spatial context in the image is achieved by using a wavelet domain indicator of the local spatial activity. The proposed method is of low complexity, both in its implementation and \u2026",
                "We develop three novel wavelet domain denoising methods for subband-adaptive, spatially-adaptive and multivalued image denoising. The core of our approach is the estimation of the probability that a given coefficient contains a significant noise-free component, which we call \"signal of interest\". In this respect, we analyze cases where the probability of signal presence is 1) fixed per subband, 2) conditioned on a local spatial context, and 3) conditioned on information from multiple image bands. All the probabilities are estimated assuming a generalized Laplacian prior for noise-free subband data and additive white Gaussian noise. The results demonstrate that the new subband-adaptive shrinkage function outperforms Bayesian thresholding approaches in terms of mean-squared error. The spatially adaptive version of the proposed method yields better results than the existing spatially adaptive ones of similar and \u2026",
                "Image segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical image analysis and is often the first and the most critical step in many clinical applications. In brain MRI analysis, image segmentation is commonly used for measuring and visualizing the brain\u2019s anatomical structures, for analyzing brain changes, for delineating pathological regions, and for surgical planning and image-guided interventions. In the last few decades, various segmentation techniques of different accuracy and degree of complexity have been developed and reported in the literature. In this paper we review the most popular methods commonly used for brain MRI segmentation. We highlight differences between them and discuss their capabilities, advantages, and limitations. To address the complexity and challenges of the brain MRI segmentation problem, we first introduce the basic concepts of image segmentation. Then, we explain different MRI preprocessing steps including image registration, bias field correction, and removal of nonbrain tissue. Finally, after reviewing different brain MRI segmentation methods, we discuss the validation problem in brain MRI segmentation.",
                "A new fuzzy filter is presented for the noise reduction of images corrupted with additive noise. The filter consists of two stages. The first stage computes a fuzzy derivative for eight different directions. The second stage uses these fuzzy derivatives to perform fuzzy smoothing by weighting the contributions of neighboring pixel values. Both stages are based on fuzzy rules which make use of membership functions. The filter can be applied iteratively to effectively reduce heavy noise. In particular, the shape of the membership functions is adapted according to the remaining noise level after each iteration, making use of the distribution of the homogeneity in the image. A statistical model for the noise distribution can be incorporated to relate the homogeneity to the adaptation scheme of the membership functions. Experimental results are obtained to show the feasibility of the proposed approach. These results are also \u2026",
                "This paper presents a new wavelet-based image denoising method, which extends a \"geometrical\" Bayesian framework. The new method combines three criteria for distinguishing supposedly useful coefficients from noise: coefficient magnitudes, their evolution across scales and spatial clustering of large coefficients near image edges. These three criteria are combined in a Bayesian framework. The spatial clustering properties are expressed in a prior model. The statistical properties concerning coefficient magnitudes and their evolution across scales are expressed in a joint conditional model. The three main novelties with respect to related approaches are (1) the interscale-ratios of wavelet coefficients are statistically characterized and different local criteria for distinguishing useful coefficients from noise are evaluated, (2) a joint conditional model is introduced, and (3) a novel anisotropic Markov random field prior \u2026",

                "The authors propose a novel imaging system useful in dermatology, more precisely, for the follow-up of patients with an increased risk of skin cancer. The system consists of a Pentium PC equipped with an RGB frame grabber, a three-chip charge coupled devices (CCD) camera controlled by the serial port and equipped with a zoom lens and a halogen annular light source. Calibration of the imaging system provides a way to transform the acquired images, which are defined in an unknown color space, to a standard, well-defined color space called SRGB, sRGB has a known relation to the CIE\/sup 1\/ XYZ and CIE L*a*b* colorimetric spaces. These CIE color spaces are based on the human vision, and they allow the computation of a color difference metric called CIE \/spl Delta\/E\/sub ab\/*, which is proportional to the color difference, as seen by a human observer.

                "Recently, the NLMeans filter has been proposed by Buades et al. for the suppression of white Gaussian noise. This filter exploits the repetitive character of structures in an image, unlike conventional denoising algorithms, which typically operate in a local neighbourhood. Even though the method is quite intuitive and potentially very powerful, the PSNR and visual results are somewhat inferior to other recent state-of-the-art non-local algorithms, like KSVD and BM-3D. In this paper, we show that the NLMeans algorithm is basically the first iteration of the Jacobi optimization algorithm for robustly estimating the noise-free image. Based on this insight, we present additional improvements to the NLMeans algorithm and also an extension to noise reduction of coloured (correlated) noise. For white noise, PSNR results show that the proposed method is very competitive with the BM-3D method, while the visual quality of our method is better due to the lower presence of artifacts. For correlated noise on the other hand, we obtain a significant improvement in denoising performance compared to recent wavelet-based techniques.",
                "This paper reports the outcomes of the 2014 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee (IADF TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (IEEE GRSS). As for previous years, the IADF TC organized a data fusion contest aiming at fostering new ideas and solutions for multisource remote sensing studies. In the 2014 edition, participants considered multiresolution and multisensor fusion between optical data acquired at 20-cm resolution and long-wave (thermal) infrared hyperspectral data at 1-m resolution. The Contest was proposed as a double-track competition: one aiming at accurate landcover classification and the other seeking innovation in the fusion of thermal hyperspectral and color data. In this paper, the results obtained by the winners of both tracks are presented and discussed.",
                "We propose a novel semisupervised local discriminant analysis method for feature extraction in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, with improved performance in both ill-posed and poor-posed conditions. The proposed method combines unsupervised methods (local linear feature extraction methods and supervised method (linear discriminant analysis) in a novel framework without any free parameters. The underlying idea is to design an optimal projection matrix, which preserves the local neighborhood information inferred from unlabeled samples, while simultaneously maximizing the class discrimination of the data inferred from the labeled samples. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably with conventional feature extraction methods."

                "Philip W Phillips 2121 Engineering Sciences Building (217) 244-2003 (217) 333-9819 dimer@illinois.edu Professor Philip Phillips received his bachelor's degree from Walla Walla College in 1979, and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1982. After a Miller Fellowship at Berkeley, he joined the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1984-1993). Professor Phillips came to the University of Illinois in 1993. Professor Phillips is a theoretical condensed matter physicist who has an international reputation for his work on transport in disordered and strongly correlated low-dimensional systems. He is the inventor of various models for Bose metals, Mottness, and the random dimer model, which exhibits extended states in one dimension, thereby representing an exception to the localization theorem of Anderson's. His research focuses sharply on explaining current experimental observations that challenge the standard paradigms of electron transport and magnetism in solid state physics. Departures from paradigms tell us that there is much to learn. Such departures are expected to occur in the presence of strong-electron interactions, disorder, and in the vicinity of zero-temperature quantum critical points. The common question posed by experiments that probe such physics is quite general. Simply, how do strong Coulomb interactions and disorder conspire to mediate zero-temperature states of matter? It is precisely the strongly interacting electron problem or any strongly coupled problem for that matter, such as quark confinement, that represents one of the yet-unconquered frontiers in physics. Understanding the physics of strong coupling is Phillips' primary focus. Books, Talks, and Classes Taught Mottness: Physics of High-Temperature Cuprate Superconductors The cuprate superconductors are doped Mott insulators whose phase diagram exhibits numerous departures from Fermi liquid theory, most notably the pseudogap and strange metal (resistivity scaling linearly with temperature) regimes of the normal state. Typical approaches to this problem include 1) phenomenology based on some preferred ordered state, 2) numerical simulations, and 3) inspired guesses as to the low-energy degrees of freedom. Our work aims to establish a general principle from which the inherent strong-coupling physics of a doped Mott insulator arises.  Ultimately the route to solving any strongly coupled problem is to isolate the propagating degrees of freedom. Typically the propagating modes cannot be read off by inspecting a Hamiltonian but rather are dynamically generated through a collective organization of the elemental fields.  In identifying the principle that leads to such organization, it helps to know what to throw out. A ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated systems such as a doped Mott insulator, not seen in weakly interacting systems, is spectral weight transfer over wide energy scales. The general class of phenomena arising from such transfer of spectral weight we termed Mottness. Determining what are the strongly correlated entities that get rid of spectral weight transfer would then re-instate a rigid band picture, rendering the problem then weakly coupled. We have succeeded in doing precisely this by integrating out exactly the high-energy degrees of freedom in a doped Mott insulator described by the Hubbard model. New propagating degrees of freedom, bound states of holes and charge 2e bosons, emerge which are capable of explaining the pseudogap and the transition to the strange metal regimes. Much of our current effort is on elucidating how these new degrees of freedom pair up to form the superconducting state. Fe-based Superconductors Discovered in 2006, Fe-based superconductors are multi-orbital systems in the intermediate coupling regime. That is, neither purely localized nor itinerant electron pictures are valid. Undoped, the parent Fe-based materials are all metals, though they exhibit magnetic order. We are currently exploring models in which orbital ordering, magnetism, and superconductivity are intertwined. Dirty Bosons In the presence of disorder, bosons form a glassy insulating phase characterized by a vanishing gap, finite compressibility, and infinite superfluid susceptibility. One of the outstanding questions in the field of dirty bosons, a field which is becoming increasingly accessible to optical lattice experiments, is what is the universality class of the Bose glass to superfluid transition. Renormalization group calculations on the disordered Bose-Hubbard model are currently being performed to address this problem.  A second problem of interest is the nature of the metallic phase that disrupts the superconductor-insulator transition in dirty thin film superconductors such as Al deposited on Ge. Such a metallic phase poses a distinct problem because bosons are thought to exist in two phases: localized in an insulator or delocalized in a superconducting state.  We showed several years ago that a third possibility exists in which bosonic excitations of a phase glass exhibit a non-zero conductivity at zero temperature.  An open question with this model is the nature of the phase stiffness at finite temperature. Topological Insulators Topological insulators possess robust surface states which can in principle exhibit metallic behavior. We have become interested in this general class of problem in light of experiments on elemental bismuth (not a topological insulator) that have reported anomalous quantum oscillations at high magnetic fields (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a1\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u009d9 T) along the trigonal crystal axis. The curious feature of these oscillations is that they occur at magnetic fields which would conrespond to fractional occupancy of Landau levels, in a manner reminiscent of the FQH effect in 2d.  We currently know of no instances of electron fractionalization in 3d and what we know about the fractional quantum Hall effect indicates that 2d is essential. Hence, these experiments have raised a potentially interesting question. Our current thinking on this problem is that the surface states are mediating the observed oscillations in the Nernst effect and a proper theory of the surface states indicates integer occupancy of the surface Landau levels.  We are currently exploring if surface states in Bi-Sb alloys can similarly give rise to the recent claims of quantum oscillations associated with a 2d Fermi surface. Cuprate Physics from Gauge\/Gravity Duality My emphasis that the cuprate problem is fundamentally one of strong coupling has led to a search for new theoretical tools. One such tool is the gauge\/gravity duality or the AdS\/CFT conjecture, in which a strongly coupled quantum theory is mapped onto a weakly interacting theory of gravity. I am interested in extracting the physics of the strong-coupling physics of the Hubbard model using this technique. I am taking two different approaches towards this problem, namely top-down and bottom-up. In a top-down approach, a holographic Hubbard model is constructed at the intersection of D-branes (open strings with Dirichlet boundary conditions), while in the bottom-up approach, one tries to engineer a minimal gravitational system to mimic the essential features of the model. The results of a bottom-up scheme are shown in the accompanying figure. We have shown that at the boundary of an AdS Reissner-Nordstrom space-time with a bulk Pauli coupling, fermions are gapped.  No continuous symmetry is broken once the gap opens and spectral weight is transferred over all energy scales, as in the Hubbard model of a doped Mott insulator.

Phillips group exactly solves key experimental puzzle in high temperature superconductivity: Cooper pairing and wave function for superconducting state in doped Mott insulators Now a team of theoretical physicists at the Institute for Condensed Matter Theory (ICMT) in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by Illinois Physics Professor Philip Phillips , has for the first time exactly solved a representative model of the cuprate problem, the 1992 Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model of a doped Mott insulator. In the Media Phillips and Weissman in Science : \"Academic societies' role in curbing police brutality\" The shocking death of George Floyd is unfortunately not a singular event in the United States. Eric Garner, Michael Br own, Freddie Gray, Amadou Diallo ( 1 ), and Breonna Taylor ( 2 ) are just a few examples from a long list of unarmed Black people who have died at the hands of the police. This pattern of violence is deeply rooted in the history of Black-White relations in the United States and the failure of the leaders of this country to deal with systemic racism. As professional physicists, we suggest that professional science and humanities organizations such as the American Physical Society (APS) take action by refusing to hold conferences in cities where police brutality takes place.

Philip Phillips and grad student Christian Boyd get Physical Review B Editor's Suggestion EDITORS' SUGGESTION: \" Single-parameter scaling in the magnetoresistance of optimally doped La 2 \u2212 x Sr x CuO 4 \" Single-parameter scaling is a heralded consequence of criticality. In magnetotransport, however, the electron mobility typically couples to magnetic field and produces a form of single-parameter scaling in noncritical systems. Here, the authors examine recent magnetoresistance data on thin film La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 and find that, unlike the case of the quantum critical iron superconductors, single-parameter scaling ceases in conjunction with the breakdown of a classical disorder description for the magnetoresistance at the lowest temperatures. This call into question the relationship between material inhomogeneity and critical scaling in cuprates. Christian Boyd and Philip W. Phillips Phys. Rev. B 100 , 155139 (2019)"
