                "Fulin  Zuo fzuo@miami.edu (305) 284-7114 4245 My research interests are twofold. One is in the studies of new phenomena of novel materials, especially low dimensional materials such as the cuprate and organic superconductors, meso and nano-magnetic materials by probing experimentally their transport and magnetic properties. These experiments are usually carried out as a function of temperature, electric and magnetic field to differentiate various models. The other is in the technological applications of novel electronic properties. For example, the study of excess noises in the superconducting transition to optimize the use of transition edge microcalorimeters in x-ray detection. 1988 Ph.D.  The Ohio State University COURSE LINKS University Physics II | Phy207 COURSE LINKS University Physics II | Phy207 COURSE LINKS University Physics II | Phy207 LIST OF SPECIALTIES: electronic properties of novel materials such as the high temperature oxide superconductor and low temperature organic superconductors, meso and nano-magnetic materials through experimental transport and magnetic measurements Fulin Zuo \"A geometric method to determine the electric field due to a uniformly charged line segment\"  American Journal of Physics  (Cornell University Library. 2014).
