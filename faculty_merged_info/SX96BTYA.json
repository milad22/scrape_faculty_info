Cereghetti Professor of Practice, Physics Room 410, Deming Lewis Lab 610-758-3808 Prof. Cereghetti received her PhD in Physics from ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in 2000 with a dissertation titled \"On the Dynamics of Glassy Phase States: an NMR Investigation\". Her research at ETH focused on theoretical and experimental work on one and two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methods to investigate spin diffusion, polymer dynamics, and pseudo spin glass system dynamics. Dr. Cereghetti also holds a M.A. in Chinese Studies from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where she investigated colored Chinese materia medica produced over a period ranging from the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 AD) to the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 AD).
