                "This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2778 new measurements from 645 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on CKM quark-mixing matrix, Vud & Vus, Vcb & Vub, top quark, muon anomalous magnetic moment, extra dimensions, particle detectors, cosmic background radiation, dark matter, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology.",

The goal of these projects is to explore possible flavor mixing in the Lepton sector. Besides his involvement in these ongoing projects, he is interested in the development of a new generation of double beta decay experiments to provide a direct neutrino mass test. He is a member of the Particle Data Group. He held research positions at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (Germany) and the California Institute of Technology and was a Feodor-Lynen Fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. Professor Piepke received his doctoral degree from the Ruprecht Karls University at Heidelberg (Germany) in 1990. He joined the faculty of The University of Alabama in 2000."
