                "Urosepsis is a bacteraemia infection caused by an organism previously causing an infection in the urinary tract of a patient, a diagnosis which has been classically confirmed by culture of the same species of bacteria from both blood and urine samples. Given the new insights afforded by sequencing technologies into the complicated population structures of infectious agents affecting humans, we sought to investigate urosepsis by comparing the genome sequences of blood and urine isolates of Escherichia coli from five patients with urosepsis. The results confirm the classical urosepsis hypothesis in four of the five cases, but also show the complex nature of extra-intestinal E. coli infection in the fifth case, where three distinct strains caused two distinct infections. Additionally, we show there is little to no variation in the bacterial genome as it progressed from urine to blood, and also present a minimal set of virulence \u2026",
                "The prevalence of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-producing E. coli) has recently increased worldwide. This study aims at determining the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of a collection of clinical E. coli urine isolates and evaluating the ESBL carriage of these isolates at phenotypic and genotypic levels. A total of 100 E. coli urine isolates were collected at a tertiary healthcare centre in Riyadh from January 2018 to March 2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out for all isolates. ESBL production was characterized at phenotypic and genotypic levels using double-disc synergy test and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Detection of different ESBL variants was performed using DNA sequencing. Of 100 E. coli isolates, 67 were associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. All isolates showed variable resistance levels to all antibiotics used here expect to imipenem, where they were all imipenem-sensitive. 33 out of 100 E. coli isolates were positive for ESBLs by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Among all ESBL-positive E. coli isolates, the CTX-M was the most prevalent ESBL type (31\/33 isolates; 93.94%). CTX-M-15 variant was detected in all isolates associated with CTX-M carriage. Multiple ESBL gene carriage was detected in 15\/33 isolates (45.45%), where 11 (33.33%) isolates produced two different ESBL types while 4 isolates (12.12%) associated with carrying three different ESBL types. Our study documented the high antimicrobial resistance of ESBL-producing E. coli to many front-line antibiotics currently used to treat UTI patients, and this implies the need to continuously \u2026",
                "E.coli ST131 is a globally disseminated clone of multi-drug resistant E. coli responsible for that vast majority of global extra-intestinal E. coli infections. Recent global genomic epidemiological studies have highlighted the highly clonal nature of this group of bacteria, however there appears to be inconsistency in some phenotypes associated with the clone, in particular capsule types as determined by K-antigen testing both biochemically and by PCR. We performed improved quality assemblies on ten ST131 genomes previously sequenced by our group and compared them to a new reference genome sequence JJ1886 to identify the capsule loci across the drug-resistant clone H30Rx. Our data shows considerable genetic diversity within the capsule locus of H30Rx clone strains which is mirrored by classical K antigen testing. The varying capsule locus types appear to be randomly distributed across the H30Rx phylogeny suggesting multiple recombination events at this locus, but that this capsule heterogeneity has little to no effect on virulence associated phenotypes in vitro. Our data provides a framework for determining the capsular genetics of E. coli ST131 and further beyond to ExPEC strains, and highlights how capsular mosaicism may be an important strategy in becoming a successful globally disseminated human pathogen.",
                "Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are the major aetiological agent of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in humans. The emergence of the CTX-M producing clone E. coli ST131 represents a major challenge to public health worldwide. A recent study on the metabolic potential of E. coli isolates demonstrated an association between the E. coli ST131 clone and enhanced utilisation of a panel of metabolic substrates. The studies presented here investigated the metabolic potential of ST131 and other major ExPEC ST isolates using 120 API test reagents and found that ST131 isolates demonstrated a lower metabolic activity for 5 of 120 biochemical tests in comparison to non-ST131 ExPEC isolates. Furthermore, comparative phenotypic microarray analysis showed a lack of specific metabolic profile for ST131 isolates countering the suggestion that these bacteria are metabolically fitter and therefore more successful human pathogens.",
                "The antimicrobial resistance of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) has progressively been reported worldwide. This resistance has been ascribed to global dissemination of a single E. coli clone, namely E. coli sequence type 131 (E. coli ST131). The main goal of this study is to determine the prevalence and molecular traits of ST131 and its subclones among E. coli clinical urine isolates in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Sixty E. coli urine isolates, of different extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) carriage, were involved in this study. Molecular characterization was carried out to determine the ST131 status, phylogenetic groups and virulence carriage of these isolates. ST131 isolates were further tested to evaluate the prevalence of different phylogenetic groups, subclones and virulence carriage.Group B2 was the most common phylogroup from which E. coli isolates derived \u2026",
                "Green fabrication of nanoparticles has been established by means of a simple, economical and environmentally pleasant process. The present investigation describes the use of Myrtus communis plant leaves extract for the biosynthesis of the silver nanoparticle. The surface plasmon resonance peak at 435\u2009nm, distinctive for silver, determined the synthesis of AgNP. The morphology of the particles was spherical and in size with an average diameter of \u223c 15\u2009nm. Energy dispersive X-ray Fourier Transformed Infrared and X-ray diffraction techniques investigated the crystalline structure, purity and functional groups. The biogenic nanoparticles revealed the antibacterial efficacy against both gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria, suggesting its prospective applicability as an effective antibacterial agent.",
                "Poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase is known to decompose PHB, biodegradable polymers and therefore has great commercial significance in the bioplastic sector. However, reports on PHB depolymerases from isolates obtained from plastic-contaminated sites that reflect the potential of the source organism is scarce. In this study, we evaluated the production of extracellular PHB depolymerase from Microbacterium paraoxydans RZS6 isolated from the plastic-contaminated site in the municipal area of Shahada, Maharashtra, India, for the first time. The isolate was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (GC-FAME), and BIOLOG method. Ithydrolyzed PHB on minimal salt medium (MSM) containing PHB as the only source of carbon. The isolate produced PHB depolymerase at 45\u00b0C during 48 h of incubation. The enzyme was purified most efficiently using octyl-sepharose CL-4B column, with the highest purification yield of 6.675 Umg-1mL-1. The activity of the enzyme was enhanced in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions but inhibited by Fe2+ (1 mM) ions and mercaptoethanol (1000 rpm). the nzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme was a metalloenzyme; requiring Mg2+ ions, that showed optimum enzyme activity at 30\u00b0C (mesophilic) and under neutrophilic (pH 7) conditions. Scale-up from the shake-flask level to a laboratory-scale bioreactor further enhanced the enzyme yield by 0.809 UmL-1. The molecular weight of the enzyme (40 kDa), as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, closely resembled the PHB depolymerase of \u2026",
                "Lectin is a nonimmunogenic glycoprotein that has been extracted mostly from the primary plant source leguminoase. Its ability to precisely recognize and bind to the complex cell bound structure enables it to play diverse roles. In this study, we obligate to define new sources of lectins since the production of lectins is very expensive. Therefore, we performed a study with the goal to isolate and characterize lectin from bacteria of plant origin and screen its ability as an antibacterial, antibiofilm and antiproliferative agent.We investigated isolates of environmental origin for their ability to produce lectin using phenotypic and molecular detection. The lectin was purified from an isolate AB119 which has abundant lectin activity and its molecular weight was determined by SDS\u2010PAGE and HPLC. This lectin has a molecular weight of 30 kD and used to evaluate its antimicrobial, antibiofilm and \u2026",
                "Bacteraemia is an international threat caused by extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). Recently, the antimicrobial resistance of ExPEC has increased substantially, and this is attributed to the dissemination of E. coli ST131 clone. The present study explored the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) carriage, virulence capacity and the prevalence of ST131 clone in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Thirty-one E. coli blood isolates, collected between January 2018 and March 2018, were used. The prevalence of ST131 clone was determined based on the PCR assays. Twenty-eight (90.3%) of all tested isolates were resistant to ampicillin, while only 1 isolate (3.2%) showed resistance to imipenem. Sixteen (51.6%) of the all isolates were ESBL producers, with CTX-M-15 being the predominant ESBL type. The virulence potential was higher among ESBL-producing isolates \u2026",
                "The present study explored the phytochemicals, antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic effect of Tridax procumbens leaves. The leaves were dried and extracted with various organic solvents. The leaves contained the phytochemicals such as alkaloids, carbohydrates, polyphenols and tannins respectively. Antimicrobial potentials of the extracts were determined by performing the disc diffusion techniques. Results revealed that different organic solvents extracts namely methanol, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts documented comparatively good activity against the studied microbial strains. The methanol extract of leaves of T. procumbens showed combatively better antioxidant potential. The tested plant leaf extract showed high activity against human lung cancer cells than breast cancer cell lines. 250 \u00b5g\/ml plants extract showed 84 \u00b1 2.8% toxicity against human lung cancer cells."
