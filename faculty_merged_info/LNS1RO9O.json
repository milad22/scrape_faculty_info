                "In this paper we present measurements of thermal transport in spherical geometry made with 24 uv (351-nm) beams from the OMEGA laser system of the Laboratory for Laser Energetics of the University of Rochester. The measurements, using time-resolved x-ray spectroscopy on solid glass targets coated with varying thicknesses of plastic, provide absolute measurements of the onset times of the resonance x-ray lines of silicon. From these measurements, the scaling of the instantaneous mass-ablation rate with absorbed intensity is obtained for times before and after the peak of the laser pulse. The observed large burnthrough depths and early onsets of the x-ray lines are explained by carrying out detailed hydrodynamic-code simulations for the range of the estimated laser-intensity distribution on target which is obtained from the superposition of the equivalent target-plane intensity distribution of a single beam. We \u2026",
                "This is a review of some recent development in femtosecond filamentation science with emphasis on our collective work. Previously reviewed work in the field will not be discussed. We thus start with a very brief description of the fundamental physics of single filamentation of powerful femtosecond laser pulses in air. Intensity clamping is emphasized. One consequence is that the peak intensity inside one or more filaments would not increase significantly even if one focuses the pulse at very high peak power even up to the peta-watt level. Another is that the clamped intensity is independent of pressure. One interesting outcome of the high intensity inside a filament is filament fusion which comes from the nonlinear change of index of refraction inside the filament leading to cross beam focusing. Because of the high intensity inside the filament, one can envisage nonlinear phenomena taking place inside a \u2026",
                "Single-channel waveguides and Y couplers were fabricated in chalcogenide thin films by use of femtosecond laser pulses from a 25-MHz repetition rate Ti:sapphire laser. Refractive-index differentials (\u0394n>10^-2) were measured through interferometric microscopy and are higher than the typical values reported for oxide glasses. The dependence of the index differential on the peak intensity reveals the nonlinear nature of the photosensitivity in arsenic trisulfide below its bandgap energy, and the refractive-index change is correlated to the photoinduced structural changes inferred by Raman spectroscopy data. A free-electron model to predict the parametric dependence of \u0394n is proposed.",
                "We report the observation of an extended series of integral harmonic lines in the spectrum of direct backscatter of 10.6\u2010\u03bcm radiation incident at intensities \u22731014 W\/cm2 onto planar solid targets. We have observed and spectrally resolved up to the eleventh harmonic (0.95 \u03bcm) at intensities well above the plasma continuum background.",
                "Absorber-free transmission and butt-welding of different polymers were performed using thulium fiber laser radiation at the wavelength 2 \u03bcm. The relations between the laser process conditions and the dimensions and quality of the seam were investigated by means of optical and phase-contrast microscopy. Mechanical properties of the weld joints were studied in tensile strength tests. Laser-welded polyethylene samples revealed a tensile strength of greater than 80% of the bulk material strength. Transmission welding of different polymer combinations featured the formation of different joint classes depending on the spectral properties. The experiments demonstrate new application areas of mid-IR fiber laser sources for materials processing.",
                "Femtosecond laser direct writing is employed for the fabrication of buried tubular waveguides in bulk poly(methyl methacrylate). A novel technique using selective chemical etching is presented to resolve the two-dimensional refractive-index profile of the fabrication structures. End-to-end coupling in the waveguides reveals a near-field intensity distribution that results from the superimposition of several propagating modes with different azimuthal symmetries. Mode analysis of the tubular waveguides is performed using the finite-difference method, and the possible propagating mode profiles are compared with the experimental data."
