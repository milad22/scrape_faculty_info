Meteorology ( Cloud Physics ), University of Wisconsin, 1986, Thesis: A Theoretical Determination of the Scavenging Coefficient of Submicron Particles by Fog Advisor : Prof. Pao-Kuan Wang B.S. Engineering ( Mechanical Engineering ), Cornell University, 1983, I have undertaken research in a wide variety of areas. My early work studied the microphysics of cloud droplets and the structure of ionic aqueous solutions at interfaces. In the late 1990s I researched the kinetics of relaxation of fluid properties near the critical point. More recently I\u2019ve investigated models of unique fractional-quantum hall states and quantum dots.
