                "We report a simple method for preparing polycrystalline ZnO thin films with good luminescent properties: the oxidization of metallic Zn films. In photoluminescence (PL) studies at room temperature for wavelengths between 370 and 675 nm, we have observed a single exciton peak around 390 nm without any deep-level emission and a small PL full width at half maximum (23 meV), indicating that the concentrations of the defects responsible for the deep-level emissions are negligible. We have also observed optically pumped lasing action in these films. The threshold intensity for lasing was \u223c9 MW\/cm2.",
                "A series of copper-doped zinc oxide films were grown by pulsed-laser ablation. Films grown under conditions that produced n-type ZnO were nonmagnetic while those grown under conditions that produced p-type were ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature above 350 K. The magnetic moment per copper atom decreased as the copper concentration increased. An explanation for this result is proposed based on the distance between nearest-neighbor copper atoms.",
                "The synthesis and properties of the hybrid organic\/inorganic germanium perovskite compounds, AGeI3, are reported (A = Cs, organic cation). The systematic study of this reaction system led to the isolation of 6 new hybrid semiconductors. Using CsGeI3 (1) as the prototype compound, we have prepared methylammonium, CH3NH3GeI3 (2), formamidinium, HC(NH2)2GeI3 (3), acetamidinium, CH3C(NH2)2GeI3 (4), guanidinium, C(NH2)3GeI3 (5), trimethylammonium, (CH3)3NHGeI3 (6), and isopropylammonium, (CH3)2C(H)NH3GeI3 (7) analogues. The crystal structures of the compounds are classified based on their dimensionality with 1\u20134 forming 3D perovskite frameworks and 5\u20137 1D infinite chains. Compounds 1\u20137, with the exception of compounds 5 (centrosymmetric) and 7 (nonpolar acentric), crystallize in polar space groups. The 3D compounds have direct band gaps of 1.6 eV (1), 1.9 eV (2), 2.2 eV (3), and \u2026",

                "The effect of a regular array of magnetic dipoles embedded in a superconducting film was investigated. A large asymmetry in critical currents was found between when the magnetic dipoles are aligned and antialigned with respect to an externally applied magnetic field. Enhanced pinning effects were observed when the flux lattice and the dipole lattice were commensurate. The data are used to infer pinning mechanisms, strengths, and sites."

He also studies various linear and non-linear optical phenomena with special emphasis on those associated with excitons and plasmons in bulk materials as well as thin films and various nanostructured forms. He is Director of the Magnetic and Physical Properties Measurement Facility, a non-profit laboratory that provides highly accurate measurements of magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, microwave absorption, thermal transport, and other properties to researchers in physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and geology.
