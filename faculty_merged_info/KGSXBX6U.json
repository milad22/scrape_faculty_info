                "A thorough understanding of the magnetocaloric properties of existing magnetic refrigerant materials has been an important issue in magnetic refrigeration technology. This paper reviews a new class of magnetocaloric material, that is, the ferromagnetic perovskite manganites (R1\u2212xMxMnO3, where R=La, Nd, Pr and M=Ca, Sr, Ba, etc.). The nature of these materials with respect to their magnetocaloric properties has been analyzed and discussed systematically. A comparison of the magnetocaloric effect of the manganites with other materials is given. The potential manganites are nominated for a variety of large- and small-scale magnetic refrigeration applications in the temperature range of 100\u2013375 K. It is believed that the manganite materials with the superior magnetocaloric properties in addition to cheap materials-processing cost will be the option of future magnetic refrigeration technology.",
                "Since the discovery of the magnetoimpedance (MI) effect just over a decade ago, international research interest into the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect has been growing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the GMI topic, encompassing fundamental understanding of the GMI phenomena, the processing and properties of GMI materials and the design and application of GMI-based magnetic sensors. The paper starts with the definition of GMI and an assessment of the current theoretical understanding of the frequency dependence of GMI. Then a detailed description of processing methods for the production of amorphous and nanocrystalline GMI materials in the form of wires, ribbons and thin films is given, with an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Properties of existing GMI materials including magnetic, mechanical, electrical and chemical properties \u2026",
                "Reduced dimensionality and interlayer coupling in van der Waals materials gives rise to fundamentally different electronic 1, optical 2 and many-body quantum 3, 4, 5 properties in monolayers compared with the bulk. This layer-dependence permits the discovery of novel material properties in the monolayer regime. Ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a coveted property that would allow fundamental studies of spin behaviour in low dimensions and enable new spintronics applications 6, 7, 8. Recent studies have shown that for the bulk-ferromagnetic layered materials CrI 3 (ref. 9) and Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 (ref. 10), ferromagnetic order is maintained down to the ultrathin limit at low temperatures. Contrary to these observations, we report the emergence of strong ferromagnetic ordering for monolayer VSe 2, a material that is paramagnetic in the bulk 11, 12. Importantly, the ferromagnetic ordering with a large \u2026",
                "This letter reports on the superior magnetocaloric properties of La0.7Ca0.3\u2212xSrxMnO3 (x=0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.25) single crystals. Upon 50 kOe applied field, the magnetic entropy changes (\u0394SM) reach values of \u223c10.5, 7.45, 6.97, and 6.86J\u2215kgK for x=0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.25 compositions, respectively. The large magnetic entropy changes have been found to occur around 300 K, thus allowing magnetic refrigeration at room temperature. Due to the absence of grains in the single crystals, the \u0394SM distribution here is much more uniform than that of gadolinium and polycrystalline manganites, which is desirable for an Ericson-cycle magnetic refrigerator. The single crystals have the large magnetic entropy changes induced by low magnetic field change, which is beneficial for the household application of active magnetic refrigerant (AMR) materials. These results indicate that the present single crystals are \u2026",
                "The influence of first- and second-order magnetic phase transitions on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and refrigerant capacity (RC) of charge-ordered Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3 has been investigated. The system undergoes a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at TC\u223c255\u2002K followed by a ferromagnetic charge-disordered to antiferromagnetic charge-ordered transition at TCO\u223c165\u2002K. While the first-order magnetic transition (FOMT) at TCO induces a larger MCE (6.8\u2002J\/kg\u2009K) limited to a narrower temperature range resulting in a smaller RC (168 J\/kg), the second-order magnetic transition at TC induces a smaller MCE (3.2\u2002J\/kg\u2009K) but spreads over a broader temperature range resulting in a larger RC (215 J\/kg). In addition, large magnetic and thermal hysteretic losses associated with the FOMT below TCO are detrimental to an efficient magnetic RC, whereas these effects are negligible below TC because of the \u2026"
