                "Supersymmetric theories involve spinorial partners for the gluons of QCD. If the symmetry breaking is such that they are massless or light, they probably combine with quarks to form families of new, relatively low-lying hadrinic states, which decay into ordinary hadrons and a new, neutrino-like particle. We discuss how present experiments can put limits on their production.",
                "The application of simple dimensional counting to bound states of pointlike particles enables us to derive scaling laws for the asymptotic energy dependence of electromagnetic and hadronic scattering at fixed cm angle which only depend on the number of constituent fields of the hadrons. Assuming quark constituents, some of the s\u2192\u221e, fixed-t s predictions are (d \u03c3 dt) \u03c0 p\u2192 \u03c0 p\u223c s\u2212 8,(d \u03c3 dt) pp\u2192 pp\u223c s\u2212 10,(d \u03c3 dt) \u03b3 p\u2192 \u03c0 p\u223c s\u2212 7,(d \u03c3 dt) \u03b3 p\u2192 \u03b3 p\u223c s\u2212 6, F \u03c0 (q 2)\u223c(q 2)\u2212 1, and F 1 p (q 2)\u223c(q 2)\u2212 2. We show that such scaling laws are characteristic of renormalizable field theories satisfying certain conditions.",
                "Dimensional scaling laws are developed as an approach to understanding the energy dependence of high-energy scattering processes at fixed center-of-mass angle. Given a reasonable assumption on the short-distance behavior of bound states, and the absence of an internal mass scale, we show that at large s and t, d \u03c3 dt (A B\u2192 C D)\u223c s\u2212 n+ 2 f (t s); n is the total number of fields in A, B, C, and D which carry a finite fraction of the momentum. A similar scaling law is obtained for large-p\u22a5 inclusive scattering. When the quark model is used to specify n, we find good agreement with experiments. For instance, this accounts naturally for the (q 2)\u2212 2 asymptotic behavior of the proton form factor. We examine in detail the field-theoretic foundations of the scaling laws and the assumption which needs to be made about the short-distance and infrared behavior of a bound state.",
                "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5\u00d7 10 18 eV, derived from 20 000 events recorded at the Pierre Auger Observatory, is described. The spectral index \u03b3 of the particle flux, J\u221d E\u2212 \u03b3, at energies between 4\u00d7 10 18 eV and 4\u00d7 10 19 eV is 2.69\u00b10.02 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst), steepening to 4.2\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst) at higher energies. The hypothesis of a single power law is rejected with a significance greater than 6 standard deviations. The data are consistent with the prediction by Greisen and by Zatsepin and Kuz\u2019min.",
                "We describe the measurement of the depth of maximum, X max\ufeff, of the longitudinal development of air showers induced by cosmic rays. Almost 4000 events above 10 18 eV observed by the fluorescence detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory in coincidence with at least one surface detector station are selected for the analysis. The average shower maximum was found to evolve with energy at a rate of (106\u2212 21+ 35) g\/cm 2\/decade below 10 18.24\u00b10.05 eV, and (24\u00b13) g\/cm 2\/decade above this energy. The measured shower-to-shower fluctuations decrease from about 55 to 26 g\/cm 2. The interpretation of these results in terms of the cosmic ray mass composition is briefly discussed.",
                "We report a measurement of the flux of cosmic rays with unprecedented precision and statistics using the Pierre Auger Observatory. Based on fluorescence observations in coincidence with at least one surface detector we derive a spectrum for energies above 10 18 eV. We also update the previously published energy spectrum obtained with the surface detector array. The two spectra are combined addressing the systematic uncertainties and, in particular, the influence of the energy resolution on the spectral shape. The spectrum can be described by a broken power law E\u2212 \u03b3 with index \u03b3= 3.3 below the ankle which is measured at log 10 (E ankle\/eV)= 18.6. Above the ankle the spectrum is described by a power law with index 2.6 followed by a flux suppression, above about log 10 (E\/eV)= 19.5, detected with high statistical significance.",
                "In a colored-quark and vector-gluon model of hadrons we show that a quark carrying nearly all the momentum of a nucleon (x\u2248 1) must have the same helicity as the nucleon; consequently \u03bd W 2 n \u03bd W 2 p\u2192 3 7 as x\u2192 1, not 2 3 as might naively have been expected. Furthermore as x\u2192 1, \u03bd W 2 \u03c0\u223c(1\u2212 x) 2 and (\u03c3 L \u03c3 T) \u03c0\u223c \u03bc 2 Q\u2212 2 (1\u2212 x)\u2212 2+ O (g 2); the resulting angular dependence for e+ e\u2212\u2192 h\u00b1+ X is consistent with present data and has a distinctive form which can be easily tested when better data are available."
