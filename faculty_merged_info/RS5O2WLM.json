                "EEG oscillations are hypothesized to reflect cyclical variations in the neuronal excitability, with particular frequency bands reflecting differing spatial scales of brain operation. However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1\u20134 Hz) phase modulates theta (4\u201310 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30\u201350 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient \u2026",
                "Structural and functional hippocampal abnormalities have been previously reported in institutionalized psychopathic and aggressive populations. This study assessed whether prior findings of a right greater than left (R > L) functional asymmetry in caught violent offenders generalize to the structural domain in unsuccessful, caught psychopaths.Left and right hippocampal volumes were assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 23 control subjects, 16 unsuccessful psychopaths, and 12 successful (uncaught) community psychopaths and transformed into standardized space.Unsuccessful psychopaths showed an exaggerated structural hippocampal asymmetry (R > L) relative both to successful psychopaths and control subjects (p < .007) that was localized to the anterior region. This effect could not be explained by environmental and diagnostic confounds and \u2026",
                "Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide a critical link between the hemodynamic response, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the dynamics of the underlying neuronal activity. Single-trial ERP recordings capture the oscillatory activity that are hypothesized to underlie both communication between brain regions and amplified processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, precise interpretations of ERPs are precluded by uncertainty about their neural mechanisms. One influential theory holds that averaged sensory ERPs are generated by partial phase resetting of ongoing electroencephalographic oscillations, while another states that ERPs result from stimulus-evoked neural responses. We formulated critical predictions of each theory and tested these using direct, intracortical analyses of neural activity in monkeys. Our findings support a predominant role for stimulus-evoked \u2026",
                "Objectives: The time series of single trial cortical evoked potentials typically have a random appearance, and their trial-to-trial variability is commonly explained by a model in which random ongoing background noise activity is linearly combined with a stereotyped evoked response. In this paper, we demonstrate that more realistic models, incorporating amplitude and latency variability of the evoked response itself, can explain statistical properties of cortical potentials that have often been attributed to stimulus-related changes in functional connectivity or other intrinsic neural parameters.Methods: Implications of trial-to-trial evoked potential variability for variance, power spectrum, and interdependence measures like cross-correlation and spectral coherence, are first derived analytically. These implications are then illustrated using model simulations and verified experimentally by the analysis of intracortical local field \u2026",
                "The problem of source separation is by its very nature an inductive inference problem. There is not enough information to deduce the solution, so one must use any available information to infer the most probable solution. We demonstrate that source separation problems are well-suited for the Bayesian approach which provides a natural and logically consistent method by which one can incorporate prior knowledge to estimate the most probable solution given that knowledge.We derive the Bell-Sejnowski ICA algorithm from first principles, ie Bayes' Theorem and demonstrate how the Bayesian methodology makes explicit the underlying assumptions. We then further demonstrate the power of the Bayesian approach by deriving two separation algorithms that incorporate additional prior information. One algorithm separates signals that are known a priori to be decorrelated and the other utilizes information about the signal propagation through the medium from the sources to the detectors.",
                "Histograms are convenient non-parametric density estimators, which continue to be used ubiquitously. Summary quantities estimated from histogram-based probability density models depend on the choice of the number of bins. We introduce a straightforward data-based method of determining the optimal number of bins in a uniform bin-width histogram. By assigning a multinomial likelihood and a non-informative prior, we derive the posterior probability for the number of bins in a piecewise-constant density model given the data. In addition, we estimate the mean and standard deviations of the resulting bin heights, examine the effects of small sample sizes and digitized data, and demonstrate the application to multi-dimensional histograms.",

                "The problem of mixed signals occurs in many different contexts; one of the most familiar being acoustics. The forward problem in acoustics consists of finding the sound pressure levels at various detectors resulting from sound signals emanating from the active acoustic sources. The inverse problem consists of using the sound recorded by the detectors to separate the signals and recover the original source waveforms. In general, the inverse problem is unsolvable without additional information. This general problem is called source separation, and several techniques have been developed that utilize maximum entropy, minimum mutual information, and maximum likelihood. In previous work it has been demonstrated that these techniques can be recast in a Bayesian framework. This paper demonstrates the power of the Bayesian approach, which provides a natural means for incorporating prior information into a \u2026",
                "Bayesian probability theory is an inference calculus, which originates from a generalization of inclusion on the Boolean lattice of logical assertions to a degree of inclusion represented by a real number. Dual to this lattice is the distributive lattice of questions constructed from the ordered set of down-sets of assertions, which forms the foundation of the calculus of inquiry\u2014a generalization of information theory. In this paper we introduce this novel perspective on these spaces in which machine learning is performed and discuss the relationship between these results and several proposed generalizations of information theory in the literature."
