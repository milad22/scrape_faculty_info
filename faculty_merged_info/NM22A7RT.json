                "This is the first part of what will be a two-part review of distribution functions in physics. Here we deal with fundamentals and the second part will deal with applications. We discuss in detail the properties of the distribution function defined earlier by one of us (EPW) and we derive some new results. Next, we treat various other distribution functions. Among the latter we emphasize the so-called P distribution, as well as the generalized P distribution, because of their importance in quantum optics."

W. Ford (University\n                  of Michigan), I have been studying dissipative and fluctuation phenomena in quantum\n                  mechanics and related applications. Our emphasis has been on fundamental questions\n                  in quantum theory with special emphasis on decoherence, entanglement and superposition\n                  (Schr\u00f6dinger cat) states particularly pertaining to the areas of quantum measurement,\n                  information, teleportation, cryptography and computation, as well as the quantum-classical\n                  interface. More recently, we have been studying fundamental questions relating to\n                  measurement of quantum probability distribution functions with potential applications\n                  to a wide variety of nano and quantum information systems, with emphasis on how their\n                  entanglement properties vary with time. In addition, we are using the generalized\n                  quantum Langevin equation to explore recent topical questions in non-equilibrium statistical\n                  mechanics (particularly claims that the fundamental laws of thermodynamics may be\n                  violated in the quantum regime), and in particular, we have presented an exact solution\n                  to the radiation reaction problem. Motivated by the discovery of a unique double pulsar system, I have recently returned\n                  to a serious study of an area in which I worked for many years viz. spin effects in\n                  gravitational theory\u00a0and its relevance for hidden momentum.
