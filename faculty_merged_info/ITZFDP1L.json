                "Ferroelectric ferromagnets are exceedingly rare, fundamentally interesting multiferroic materials that could give rise to new technologies in which the low power and high speed of field-effect electronics are combined with the permanence and routability of voltage-controlled ferromagnetism 1, 2. Furthermore, the properties of the few compounds that simultaneously exhibit these phenomena 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are insignificant in comparison with those of useful ferroelectrics or ferromagnets: their spontaneous polarizations or magnetizations are smaller by a factor of 1,000 or more. The same holds for magnetic-or electric-field-induced multiferroics 6, 7, 8. Owing to the weak properties of single-phase multiferroics, composite and multilayer approaches involving strain-coupled piezoelectric and magnetostrictive components are the closest to application today 1, 2. Recently, however, a new route to ferroelectric ferromagnets \u2026",
                "We have grown epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films with smooth surfaces on (001), (101), and (111) SrTiO3 substrates using sputtering. Four-circle x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy show that the BiFeO3 thin films have rhombohedral symmetry although small monoclinic distortions have not been ruled out. Stripe ferroelectric domains oriented perpendicular to the substrate miscut direction and free of impurity phase are observed in BiFeO3 on high miscut (4\u00b0) (001) SrTiO3, which attributes to a relatively high value of remanent polarization (\u223c71\u03bcC\u2215cm2). Films grown on low miscut (0.8\u00b0) SrTiO3 have a small amount of impure phase \u03b1-Fe2O3 which contributes to lower the polarization values (\u223c63\u03bcC\u2215cm2). The BiFeO3 films grown on (101) and (111) SrTiO3 exhibited remanent polarizations of 86 and 98\u03bcC\u2215cm2, respectively.",
                "We have investigated the effect of Fe nonstoichiometry on properties of the Fe 1+ y (Te, Se) superconductor system by means of resistivity, Hall coefficient, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. We find that the excess Fe at interstitial sites of the (Te, Se) layers not only suppresses superconductivity but also results in a weakly localized electronic state. We argue that these effects originate from the magnetic coupling between the excess Fe and the adjacent Fe square-planar sheets, which favors a short-range magnetic order.",
                "We have studied the effect of biaxial strain on thin films of (001) La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. We deposited films by reactive molecular-beam epitaxy on different single crystalline substrates, varying the substrate-induced biaxial strain from \u22122.3% to +3.2%. Magnetization and electrical transport measurements reveal that the dependence of the Curie temperature on biaxial strain is in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Millis et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 83, 1588 (1998)].",
                "We study ac demagnetization in frustrated arrays of single-domain ferromagnetic islands, exhaustively resolving every (Ising-like) magnetic degree of freedom in the systems. Although the net moment of the arrays is brought near zero by a protocol with sufficiently small step size, the final magnetostatic energy of the demagnetized array continues to decrease for finer-stepped protocols and does not extrapolate to the ground-state energy. The resulting complex disordered magnetic state can be described by a maximum-entropy ensemble constrained to satisfy just nearest-neighbor correlations.",
                "We report a study of demagnetization protocols for frustrated arrays of interacting single-domain permalloy nanomagnets by rotating the arrays in a changing magnetic field. The most effective demagnetization is achieved by not only stepping the field strength down while the sample is rotating, but also by combining each field step with alternation in the field direction. By contrast, linearly decreasing the field strength or stepping the field down without alternating the field direction leaves the arrays with a larger remanent magnetic moment. These results suggest that nonmonotonic variations in field magnitude around and below the coercive field are important for the demagnetization process."

Specialties neutron scattering science, complex oxide materials, heterostructures, spintronics, magnetic nanostructures Our research focus is to explore emergent phenomena in strongly correlated materials and complex oxide heterostructures, and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Strongly correlated materials refer to a wide class of materials where the electron-electron Coulomb interaction is large and plays a key role in determining the materials properties. For strongly correlated materials, the interplay among spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom often lead to exotic phases, such as high T c superconductor, multiferroics, Mott insulators, etc. On the other hand, by growing different types of complex oxide materials on substrates to form so-call heterostructures, these oxide heterostructures can behave drastically different from bulk counterparts, largely due to the local structural distortions imposed by the epitaxial strain, the interfacial electronic, lattice and orbital reconstructions. This leads to in a variety of remarkable phenomena emerging in oxide heterostructures, such as 2D electron gas, induced superconducting interface, magnetoelectric coupling, etc. Due to the multifunctionality and tunablitity, correlated oxide heterostructures provide an opportunity to study the intriguing physics, design new materials, and may lead to innovative applications. We will study materials properties by combining various neutron scattering techniques, including neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, and polarized neutron reflectivity, together with bulk electronic and thermo transport measurements. Specifically, we will investigate materials nuclear and magnetic structure, magnetic excitation, interfacial spin structure, and electronic and thermo transport properties."
