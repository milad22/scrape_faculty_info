                "This superb and innovative handbook keys, describes and illustrates each of the 2200 species known from the 100 kml of the Ducke Reserve at Manaus in the heart of the Amazon Basin. If you are interested in tropical plants, this book is well worth acquiring, even if you do not read Portuguese. At 25 it is an absolute bargain. Each species description has 3-7 accompanying photographs of vegetative characters. Species and genera treatments are grouped in families, and there are usually five species treated per page. Family treatments begin with descriptive text, blocks of photographs of fruits and flowers and nested keys which extend into the species treatments. The whole book is weighted towards field identification using vegetative characters, as a handbook should be. The reviewer has not had the opportunity to field-test this impressive-looking volume but a friend who has says it is hard to use beyond the \u2026",
                "Measurements are presented of production properties and couplings of the recently discovered Higgs boson using the decays into boson pairs, H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3, H\u2192 Z Z\u204e\u2192 4 \u2113 and H\u2192 W W\u204e\u2192 \u2113 \u03bd \u2113 \u03bd. The results are based on the complete pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at centre-of-mass energies of s= 7 TeV and s= 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 25 fb\u2212 1. Evidence for Higgs boson production through vector-boson fusion is reported. Results of combined fits probing Higgs boson couplings to fermions and bosons, as well as anomalous contributions to loop-induced production and decay modes, are presented. All measurements are consistent with expectations for the Standard Model Higgs boson."

In order to achieve this understanding, we use advanced optical spectroscopic techniques, both time-resolved using ultrafast laser pulses, as well as quasi-steady-state methods. Our chore research focus centers around photoexcitation dynamics in organic, polymeric, and hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors.\u00a0With our ultrafast techniques, we can measure transient photoinduced absorption and luminescence, as well as nonlinear optical response of matter via coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. We are also interested in exploiting the quantum-mechanical nature of light, namely photon entanglement, to study with intricate selectivity\u00a0how photoexcited states in matter correlate with one another.\u00a0We are a diverse\u00a0and multidisciplinary group, composed of students and postdocs with formal training in chemistry, physics, and materials science.
