Nevertheless, there are a number of fundamental and seemingly simple questions we do not yet know the answer to. My present research focuses on one of those fundamental question which is how particles acquire their mass. We know very well that particles have masses, but have not yet been able to show experimentally through which mechanism it happens. Therefore, we will need to find a missing particle, the Higgs boson, which we believe is responsible for the fact that all particles have mass. The quest for the Higgs boson is presently my main research objective. In experimental particle physics we make use of Einstein\u2019s fundamental observation that mass, m , and energy, E , can be converted into each other through a simple constant c 2 : E = mc 2 . This means the higher the energy in the particle collision the higher the mass of the particles we can produce. As a rule of thumb the particles we are looking for, like the Higgs boson, are of high mass and thus the higher the energy the more discovery potential the collision has. Another feature of particle collisions is that the higher the particle\u2019s mass the rarer its production. Thus it is very important to have intense particle beams to increase the number of collisions we can produce and analyze in a given amount of time. For my research I am recording and analyzing data of high-energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. With the LHC the energy and intensity frontiers make a quantum leap forward with the collision energy increasing by a factor of seven while the intensity increases by two orders of magnitude with respect to the most powerful existing machine, the Tevatron at Fermilab. There is no certainty of what is going to happen, but I believe we are at the brink of something big as collisions at the LHC are about to open a door to truly uncharted territory.
