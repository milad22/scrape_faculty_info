                "On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12: 41: 04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026"

She is exploring new physics in nuclear and particle astrophysics, in particular, in dark matter and neutrinos. Her group is carrying out experiments in direct detection of dark matter with terrestrial-based detectors for both axions and WIMPs and searches for neutrinoless double beta decay. The current experiments include COSINE-100 located at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, DM-Ice, and IceCube located at the South Pole, CUORE, located at Gran Sasso, Italy, and HAYSTAC at Yale. Prof. Maruyama graduated with a B.S. in Applied Physics from Columbia University in 1995. She obtained her Ph.D. in atomic physics\u00a0in 2003\u00a0for atom trapping and fundamental symmetries at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) with Norval Fortson as her advisor. She then joined Stuart Freedman\u2019s group at the University of California, Berkeley \/ Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a Chancellor\u2019s Postdoctoral Fellow. There she studied Weak Interactions through beta-neutrino correlations in radioactive beta-decay of sodium-21, cooled and trapped right out of the 88-inch cyclotron. At the same time, she started carrying out a research program to search for neutrinoless double beta decay with CUORICINO and CUORE Experiments. She continued her research with double beta decay as a research scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where she joined IceCube, a neutrino telescope located at the South Pole, and created DM-Ice, a dark matter detector also at the South Pole. She joined the faculty at UW-Madison in 2011. She joined the faculty at Yale as an assistant professor in 2013 and tenured at Yale in 2016. She is an author of 200+ publications and has presented her work in numerous conferences and workshops. She is often quoted in popular science press such as APS News, Nature News, Science News, and Symmetry Magazine for her work on dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay. Ph.D., University of Washington, Seattle, 2003 Honors & Awards: She is the recipient of several awards, including Sloan Research Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, Yale Public Voices Fellowship, and Woman Physicist of the Month from CSWP. \u201cImproved Limit on Neutrionless Double-Beta Decay in 130 Te with CUORE\u201d, CUORE Collaboration, Phys.
