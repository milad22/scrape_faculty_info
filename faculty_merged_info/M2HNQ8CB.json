                "This article reviews the physics of high-temperature superconductors from the point of view of the doping of a Mott insulator. The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Anderson\u2019s idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the \u2026",
                "For most of the last century, condensed matter physics has been dominated by band theory and Landau's symmetry breaking theory. In the last twenty years, however, there has been the emergence of a new paradigm associated with fractionalisation, topological order, emergent gauge bosons and fermions, and string condensation. These new physical concepts are so fundamental that they may even influence our understanding of the origin of light and fermions in the universe. This book is apedagogical and systematic introduction to the new concepts and quantum field theoretical methods (which have fuelled the rapid developments) in condensed matter physics. It discusses many basic notions in theoretical physics which underlie physical phenomena in nature. Topics covered are dissipativequantum systems, boson condensation, symmetry breaking and gapless excitations, phase transitions, Fermi liquids, spin density wave states, Fermi and fractional statistics, quantum Hall effects, topological and quantum order, spin liquids, and string condensation. Methods covered are the path integral, Green's functions, mean-field theory, effective theory, renormalization group, bosonization in one-and higher dimensions, non-linear sigma-model, quantum gauge theory, dualities, slave-bosontheory, and exactly soluble models beyond one-dimension. This book is aimed at teaching graduate students and bringing them to the frontiers of research in condensed matter physics.",
                "A large class of topological orders can be understood and classified using the string-net condensation picture. These topological orders can be characterized by a set of data (N, d i, F l m n i j k, \u03b4 i j k). We describe a way to detect this kind of topological order using only the ground state wave function. The method involves computing a quantity called the \u201ctopological entropy\u201d which directly measures the total quantum dimension D=\u2211 i d i 2.",
                "It is shown that several different order parameters can be used to characterize a type of P-and T-violating state for spin systems, that we call chiral-spin states. There is a closely related, precise notion of chiral-spin-liquid states. We construct soluble models, based on P-and T-symmetric local-spin Hamiltonians, with chiral-spin ground states. Mean-field theories leading to chiral spin liquids are proposed. Frustration is essential in stabilizing these states. The quantum numbers of quasiparticles around the chiral spin liquids are analyzed. They generally obey fractional statistics. Based on these ideas, it is speculated that superconducting states with unusual values of the flux quantum may exist.",
                "We show that quantum systems of extended objects naturally give rise to a large class of exotic phases\u2014namely topological phases. These phases occur when extended objects, called \u201cstring-nets,\u201d become highly fluctuating and condense. We construct a large class of exactly soluble 2D spin Hamiltonians whose ground states are string-net condensed. Each ground state corresponds to a different parity invariant topological phase. The models reveal the mathematical framework underlying topological phases: tensor category theory. One of the Hamiltonians\u2014a spin-1\u2215 2 system on the honeycomb lattice\u2014is a simple theoretical realization of a universal fault tolerant quantum computer. The higher dimensional case also yields an interesting result: we find that 3D string-net condensation naturally gives rise to both emergent gauge bosons and emergent fermions. Thus, string-net condensation provides a \u2026",
                "Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids contain extremely rich internal structures which represent a whole new kind of ordering. We discuss the characterization and classification of the new orders (which are called topological orders). We also discuss the edge excitations in FQH liquids, which form the so-called chiral Luttinger liquids. The chiral Luttinger liquids at the edges also have very rich structures as a reflection of the rich topological orders in the bulk. Thus edge excitations provide us a practical way to measure topological orders in experiments.",
                "The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are shown to have q\u0303 fold g ground-state degeneracy on a Riemann surface of genus g, where q\u0303 is the ground-state degeneracy in a torus topology. The ground-state degeneracies are directly related to the statistics of the quasiparticles given by \u03b8= p\u0303\u03c0\/q\u0303. The ground-state degeneracy is shown to be invariant against weak but otherwise arbitrary perturbations. Therefore the ground-state degeneracy provides a new quantum number, in addition to the Hall conductance, characterizing different phases of the FQH systems. The phases with different ground-state degeneracies are considered to have different topological orders. For a finite system of size L, the ground-state degeneracy is lifted. The energy splitting is shown to be at most of order e\u2212 L\/\u03be. We also show that the Ginzburg-Landau theory of the FQH states (in the low-energy limit) is a dual theory of the U (1) Chern \u2026",
                "We study a new kind of ordering \u2014 topological order \u2014 in rigid states (the states with no local gapless excitations). We concentrate on characterization of the different topological orders. As an example we discuss in detail chiral spin states of 2 + 1 dimensional spin systems. Chiral spin states are described by the topological Chern-Simons theories in the continuum limit. We show that the topological orders can be characterized by a non-Abelian gauge structure over the moduli space which parametrizes a family of the model Hamiltonians supporting topologically ordered ground states. In 2 + 1 dimensions, the non-Abelian gauge structure determines possible fractional statistics of the quasi-particle excitations over the topologically ordered ground states. The dynamics of the low lying global excitations is shown to be independent of random spatial dependent perturbations. The ground state degeneracy and the non \u2026",
                "Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are gapped short-range-entangled quantum phases with a symmetry G. They can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial product state if we break the symmetry. The Haldane phase of spin-1 chain is the first example of SPT phases which is protected by SO (3) spin rotation symmetry. The topological insulator is another example of SPT phases which are protected by U (1) and time-reversal symmetries. In this paper, we show that interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by group cohomology theory: Distinct d-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with on-site symmetry G (which may contain antiunitary time-reversal symmetry) can be labeled by the elements in H 1+ d [G, U T (1)], the Borel (1+ d)-group-cohomology classes of G over the G module U T (1).

                "The low-energy effective theory of the edge excitations in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states is derived. The edge excitations are shown to form a new kind of state which is called the chiral Luttinger liquid (\u03c7LL). The effective theory is exactly soluble. This enables us to easily calculate all the low-energy properties of the edge excitations. We calculate the electron propagator and the spectral function, which clearly demonstrate the non-Fermi-liquid behaviors of the \u03c7LL. We also calculate the interference effects between excitations on different edges. We demonstrate that the properties of the edge excitations are closely related to the properties of the FQH states on compacted spaces. Thus the properties of the edge excitations can be used to characterize the topological orders in the FQH states. We also show that the FQH states with filling fractions \u03bd\u2260 1\/l must have at least two branches of edge excitations."
