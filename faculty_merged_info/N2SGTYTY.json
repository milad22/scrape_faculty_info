                "We show that an expansion of nuclear forces about the chiral limit is formally consistent and is equivalent to KSW power counting in the 1 S 0 channel and Weinberg power counting in the 3 S 1\u20133 D 1 coupled channels. Numerical evidence suggests that this expansion converges. The feasibility of making contact between nuclear physics and lattice-QCD simulations is discussed.",

Using the results of lattice QCD calculations performed on four ensembles of anisotropic clover gauge-field configurations, with spatial extents of L\u223c 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.9 fm at a spatial lattice spacing of b s\u223c 0.123 fm, we find an H dibaryon bound by B\u221e H= 16.6\u00b12.1\u00b14.6 MeV at a pion mass of m \u03c0\u223c 389 MeV.",
                "The two-nucleon sector is near an infrared fixed point of QCD and as a result the S-wave scattering lengths are unnaturally large compared to the effective ranges and shape parameters. It is usually assumed that a lattice QCD simulation of the two-nucleon sector will require a lattice that is much larger than the scattering lengths in order to extract quantitative information. In this Letter we point out that this does not have to be the case: lattice QCD simulations on much smaller lattices will produce rigorous results for nuclear physics.",
                "We present results of the first fully dynamical lattice QCD determination of nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths in the S 0 1 channel and S 1 3\u2212 D 1 3 coupled channels. The calculations are performed with domain-wall valence quarks on the MILC staggered configurations with a lattice spacing of b= 0.125 fm in the isospin-symmetric limit, and in the absence of electromagnetic interactions.",

The nuclear states are extracted from lattice QCD calculations performed with n f= 3 dynamical light quarks using an isotropic clover discretization of the quark action in three lattice volumes of spatial extent L\u223c 3.4 fm, 4.5 fm, and 6.7 fm, and with a single lattice spacing b\u223c 0.145 fm.",

A survey of the current techniques that are used to extract low-energy hadronic scattering amplitudes and interactions is followed by a review of recent two-body and few-body calculations by the NPLQCD collaboration and others. An outline of the nuclear physics that is expected to be accomplished with Lattice QCD in the next decade, along with estimates of the required computational resources, is presented.",

The calculation is performed with domain-wall valence-quark propagators on asqtad-improved MILC configurations with staggered sea quarks at a single lattice spacing, b\u223c 0.125 fm. Chiral perturbation theory is used to perform the extrapolation of the scattering length from lattice quark masses down to the physical value, and we find m \u03c0 a 2=\u2212 0.0426\u00b10.0006\u00b10.0003\u00b10.0018, in good agreement with experiment.

Calculations were performed with an anisotropic n f= 2+ 1 clover discretization in four lattice volumes of spatial extent L\u223c 2.0, 2.5, 2.9, and 3.9 fm, with a lattice spacing of b s\u223c 0.123 fm in the spatial direction and b t\u223c b s\/3.5 in the time direction. Using the results obtained in the largest two volumes, the \u039e\u2212 \u039e\u2212 is found to be bound by B \u039e\u2212 \u039e\u2212 0= 14.0 (1.4)(6.7) MeV, consistent with expectations based upon phenomenological models and low-energy effective field theories constrained by nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering data at the physical light-quark masses. Further, we find that the deuteron and the dineutron have binding energies of B d= 11 (05)(12) MeV and B n n= 7.1 (5.2)(7.3) MeV, respectively. With an \u2026",
                "We show that a central 1\/r n singular potential (with n>~ 2) is renormalized by a one-parameter square-well counterterm; low-energy observables are made independent of the square-well width by adjusting the square-well strength. We find a closed form expression for the renormalization-group evolution of the square-well counterterm.",
                "We point out a redundancy in the operator structure of the pionless effective field theory, EFT(\u03c0\u0335), which dramatically simplifies computations. This redundancy is best exploited by using dibaryon fields as fundamental degrees of freedom. In turn, this suggests a new power counting scheme which sums range corrections to all orders. We explore this method with a few simple observables: the deuteron charge form factor, np\u2192d\u03b3, and Compton scattering from the deuteron. Unlike EFT(\u03c0\u0335), the higher-dimension operators involving electroweak gauge fields are not renormalized by the s-wave strong interactions, and therefore do not scale with inverse powers of the renormalization scale. Thus, naive dimensional analysis of these operators is sufficient to estimate their contribution to a given process."

                "Silas Beane Professor silas@uw.edu 206-543-3256 B457 Nuclear Theory Biography My research currently focuses on deriving nuclear physics from the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This relies both on numerical lattice QCD calculations of nuclear properties using high-performance computing, and the application of effective field theory methods both at the hadronic level and at the level of the nuclear structure. Recently, I have also been interested in (i) a way of thinking about QCD which is called light-front or null-plane QCD, which I believe provides novel insights regarding hadronic structure, and (ii) aspects of atomic physics at the interface of two and three spatial dimensions. Our research explores a wide range of questions in contemporary nuclear theory and related fields, from the description of nuclear few-body systems with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the lattice to aspects of nucleon structure and fundamental symmetries to the properties (structure, phase transitions and dynamics) of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. Our research utilizes tools from effective field theory as well as high-performance computing on leadership class computers.
