                "Wolfgang J. Choyke Research Professor Emeritus 202 Allen Hall (412) 624-9251 choyke@pitt.edu We are primarily interested in the optical and electronic characterization of currently important large bandgap semiconductors such as AIN, GaN and SiC. Great emphasis in our research is placed on a close collaboration with the world`s most outstanding growers of single crystal boule material or single crystal epitaxial films. We have also started to learn how to prepare and study single crystal porous SiC. Many new morphologies have been discovered in both n and p type SiC and applications to medicine, gas sensing and fuel cells are being explored. Our current studies involve high resolution optical spectroscopy of free exciton and electronic band structure near the fundamental gap in 4H SiC.
