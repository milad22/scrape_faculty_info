                "The results of a systematic study of the optical properties of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x-based insulators and superconductors are reported. Specifically, we present measurements and analysis of the optical reflectivity R of a series of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x crystals in the frequency range from 30 to 20 000 cm\u2212 1 (4 meV to 2.5 eV), and temperature range from 10 to 270 K. From R we obtain the real part of the frequency-dependent optical conductivity \u03c3 (\u03c9) by Kramers-Kronig analysis. In our discussion, we emphasize the development of structure and spectral weight in \u03c3 (\u03c9) as the compounds change from insulators to high-T c superconductors with varying O content or Al doping. We identify the free carrier, and interband components of \u03c3 (\u03c9), and focus on the free-carrier component.",
                "The results of a polarized light scattering study of single-crystal YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 are presented. Strong interband electronic scattering in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4 is observed through interference effects with certain phonons. Below T c, this electronic scattering undergoes a redistribution due to gap formation, which is monitored by a rapid change in the damping rates of the strongly coupled phonons. Our lowest temperature data further indicates the presence of residual electronic scattering well below the expected 2\u0394 gap onset, suggesting that a continuum of electronic states exists inside the gap.",
                "Optical and Raman-scattering studies of a-, b-, and c-axis YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x between 0.025 and 5.5 eV are presented as a function of doping, and compared to the results of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 and La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4. Our doping-dependence studies show that the redistribution of spectral weight in the CuO 2 planes of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x differs significantly from that seen in La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4. We also find that the redistribution of spectral weight in the cuprates is primarily responsible for the loss of two-magnon Raman-scattering intensity with doping. Finally, we show that bound-carrier contributions comprise a significantly larger fraction of the spectral weight below 1 eV in lower-T c cuprates such as the 2: 1: 4 compounds than in higher-T c cuprates such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8.",
                "We report a Raman scattering investigation of superconducting gap anisotropy in single-crystal Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 \u03b4. Gap anisotropy is investigated by studying the peak in the low-temperature Raman continuum in various symmetries. Roughly a 35% difference in the energy of this peak is observed between different symmetries, suggesting the presence of substantial gap anisotropy. Anisotropy is further evidenced by the damping behavior of the 340-cm\u2212 1 Raman-active phonon below T c, which displays increased attenuation due to phonon-induced pair breaking. The temperature dependence of this attenuation is consistent with a T= 0 pair-breaking peak which is much larger than the 340-cm\u2212 1 phonon in certain regions of the Fermi surface.",
                "We present an optical reflectance and Raman-scattering study of the A 1\u2212 x A x\u2032 MnO 3 system as a function of temperature and doping (0.2<~ x<~ 0. 5). The metal-semiconductor transition in the A 1\u2212 x A x\u2032 MnO 3 system is characterized by a change from a diffusive electronic Raman-scattering response in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase, to a flat continuum scattering response in the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. We interpret this change in the scattering response as a crossover from a small-polaron-dominated regime at high temperatures to a large-polaron-dominated low-temperature regime. Interestingly, we observe evidence for the coexistence of large and small polarons in the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. We contrast these results with those obtained for EuB 6, which is a low-T c magnetic semiconductor with similar properties to the manganites, but with a substantially reduced \u2026",
                "Superconductivity in so-called unconventional superconductors is nearly always found in the vicinity of another ordered state, such as antiferromagnetism, charge density wave (CDW), or stripe order. This suggests a fundamental connection between superconductivity and fluctuations in some other order parameter. To better understand this connection, we used high-pressure X-ray scattering to directly study the CDW order in the layered dichalcogenide TiSe 2, which was previously shown to exhibit superconductivity when the CDW is suppressed by pressure 1 or intercalation of Cu atoms 2. We succeeded in suppressing the CDW fully to zero temperature, establishing for the first time the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) at P c= 5.1\u00b10.2 GPa, which is more than 1 GPa beyond the end of the superconducting region. Unexpectedly, at P= 3 GPa we observed a reentrant, weakly first order, incommensurate \u2026",

                "We have studied the development of the optical conductivity as electrons are added to the Cu-O planes in Pr 2\u2212 x Ce x CuO 4\u2212 \u03b4 by varying x (0\u2264 x\u2264 0.2). In the metallic phases, contributions to the optical conductivity below 3 eV arise from three sources: mobile carriers, mid-infrared excitations, and charge-transfer excitations. The mobile carrier spectral weight grows roughly linearly with x, while the mid-infrared band appears to evolve at low doping via a transfer of spectral weight from the charge-transfer band. Comparing these results with hole doping in La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4\u2212 \u03b4 indicates an electron-hole symmetry that is not anticipated by standard charge-transfer insulator models.",
                "We have measured the insulating energy gap \u0394 and the exchange interaction J in a series of cuprate crystals, including T\u2019-phase M 2 CuO 4 (M= Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd), T*-phase La, Tb, Sr 2 CuO 4, and T-phase La 2 CuO 4. We find that the energy gap scales predominantly with the in-plane Cu-O distance, scaling as \u03b4 log\u0394\/\u03b4 logd\u223c-6. Furthermore, contrary to simple expectations, the energy gap increases with decreasing Cu-O distance, suggesting that Coulomb and other repulsive energies dominate the effects of band hybridization. Using a three-band Hubbard-model expression, our studies of \u0394 and J in the cuprates allow us to estimate that the hopping energy t scales with Cu-O distance as \u03b4 logt\/\u03b4 logd\u223c-4."

                "S Lance Cooper Associate Head for Graduate Programs 227B Loomis Laboratory (217) 333-2589 slcooper@illinois.edu 218 Materials Research Lab (217) 333-2589 slcooper@illinois.edu Lance Cooper received a B.S. in Physics summa cum laude from the University of Virginia in 1982 and a Ph.D in Physics from the University of Illinois in 1988. After a two-year postdoctoral appointment at AT&T Bell Labs, Professor Cooper joined the UIUC faculty in 1990. From 1993-1995, he was a member of the Defense Science Study Group (DSSG), a Divisional Associate Editor for Physical Review Letters from 2006-2011, and the Secretary-Treasurer for the Division of Condensed Matter Physics of the American Physical Society from 2015-2019. Professor Cooper's group uses optical spectroscopy to reveal the properties of and excitations in novel states of matter in strongly correlated materials. His group has developed particular expertise in light-scattering experiments on materials under extreme conditions of low temperature, high pressure, and high magnetic field. The Cooper group's Raman spectroscopy experiments have shed light on the behavior of matter through various pressure- and magnetic-field-tuned quantum (T~0 K) phase transitions. The Cooper group's first accomplishment with its \"extreme conditions\" optical spectroscopy capability was a study of the evolution of the crystal lattice (\"phonon\") and atomic spin dynamics through the pressure-tuned destruction of the insulating state of layered ruthenate materials. More recently, his group has studied how high pressures \"melt\" charge- and orbital-ordered insulating states, even at T=0 K, creating novel metallic phases.  His group has also shown that magnetic fields can be used both to control the elastic properties of materials (e.g., \"magnetic field induced shape memory\") and to thwart long-range order down to T=0 K. The Cooper group has used floating zone, vapor transport, evaporative, and other methods to grow high quality single crystals, including spinel materials such as Mn 3 O 4 and CoCr 2 O 4 , orbital ordering materials such as KCuF 3 , layered chalcogenide materials such as TiSe 2 , and topological insulators like Bi 2 Se 3 . Lance Cooper also runs a Physics Grad Student Blog with job, fellowship, academic deadline, and other information of interest to graduate students; the Physics Careers seminar , in which Physics PhDs -- mostly Illinois alumni -- describe their jobs and the importance of a physics PhD and their grad school experiences to their careers; and a Physics Grad Student Travel Award program . Lance Cooper's Curriculum Vitae Field- and pressure-tuned spectroscopy of magnetically frustrated and strong spin-lattice coupled materials The development at low temperatures of some form of long-range order -- such as magnetism, orbital-order, charge-order, or superconductivity -- is ubiquitous in materials, and reflects the tendency of a material to lower its ground state degeneracy near T=0 K. We are interested in growing -- using float zone and other growth techniques -- and spectroscopically studying materials in which structural geometry and competing interactions conspire to frustrate the onset of long range magnetic and\/or orbital order, even down to T=0 K. This interest is motivated by the novel low temperature phase behavior frustrated materials have been proposed to exhibit -- including orbital- and spin-liquid phases -- and by a desire to elucidate the connection between frustration and exotic properties such as colossal magnetoresistance, and multiferroic and magnetodielectric behavior. Our current efforts include using various single crystal growth methods to grow geometically frustrated materials, and then applying field- and pressure-dependent optical spectroscopy to study orbital- and spin-disordered phases in several classes of materials, including the layered ruthenates, spinels such as Mn 3 O 4 , iridates like Sr 2 IrO 4 , and vanadates such as Ni 3 V 2 O 8 . Our results have revealed interesting routes by which magnetic and orbital frustration can be tuned with field or pressure and show the connection between orbital\/spin frustration and highly tunable properties of matter. Field- and pressure-tuned melting of orbital order in correlated materials We are also interested in creating and investigating novel orbital-liquid phases in various orbital-ordered systems such as Ca 2 RuO 4 , Ca 3 Ru 2 O 7 ,and KCuF 3 . Our results have revealed pressure-induced transitions to novel quantum liquid-like phases in which structural elements fluctuate even at T=0 K, as well as pressure- and magnetic-field-tunable insulator-metal transitions governed by controllable changes induced in the orbital population. Pressure-tuned quantum phase transitions and superconductivity in layered chalcogenide materials We are interested in studying how charge ordered and charge density wave (CDW) states melt into disordered quantum phases at low temperatures and investigating the novel phases that are predicted to develop under these conditions.  To study this, we use vapor transport growth methods to grow various layered chalcogenide single crystals, including TiSe 2 , TaSe 2 , TaS 2 , Bi 2 Se 3 , and Bi 2 Te 3 , and we study the quantum (T~0 K) phase transitions in these materials using pressure- and temperature-dependent inelastic light scattering.  For example, our low temperature, pressure-dependent inelastic light scattering studies of the critical ('soft') mode in 1T-TiSe 2 indicate that lattice compression leads to quantum melting of the CDW phase through a novel incommensurate phase that may have hexatic order, and our more recent light scattering studies of the soft mode in Cu x TiSe 2 provided evidence for x-dependent quantum mode softening and the coexistence of fluctuating CDW order and superconductivity in this system.

Research Funding WAES program will help future UIUC STEM graduates to communicate their science The University of Illinois Writing Across Engineering & Science (WAES) program has been awarded $599,999 by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the research project Advancing Adaptation of Writing Pedagogies for Undergraduate STEM Education Through Transdisciplinary Action Research . This research program, which ultimately aims to incorporate effective technical writing as a core skill taught in STEM courses across the university, is funded through NSF\u2019s Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources. Accessibility On becoming a physicist: Colin Lualdi shares the challenges and triumphs of a Deaf physics graduate student University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign physics graduate student Colin Lualdi quickly realized he was venturing into uncharted territory when he arrived at Illinois Physics at the start of Fall 2017. Deaf since birth and a native speaker of American Sign Language (ASL), Lualdi was now among a very small group worldwide of Deaf individuals working in physics. The exhilaration of performing cutting-edge research was accompanied by a sobering discovery: the lack of a common language model for effective scientific discourse in ASL was going to be a far greater challenge than he\u2019d anticipated. Lualdi has embraced his own accessibility challenges as an opportunity to address a pressing need in the broader Deaf community. He has teamed up with colleagues at other research institutions to develop a robust and shared framework for scientific discourse in ASL. Specifically, Colin has been working with ASL Clear and ASLCORE, two national scientific sign language initiatives that are making good progress.
