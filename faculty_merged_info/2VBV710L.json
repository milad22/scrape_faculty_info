                "Control of structure at the atomic level can precisely and effectively tune catalytic properties of materials, enabling enhancement in both activity and durability. We synthesized a highly active and durable class of electrocatalysts by exploiting the structural evolution of platinum-nickel (Pt-Ni) bimetallic nanocrystals. The starting material, crystalline PtNi3 polyhedra, transforms in solution by interior erosion into Pt3Ni nanoframes with surfaces that offer three-dimensional molecular accessibility. The edges of the Pt-rich PtNi3 polyhedra are maintained in the final Pt3Ni nanoframes. Both the interior and exterior catalytic surfaces of this open-framework structure are composed of the nanosegregated Pt-skin structure, which exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The Pt3Ni nanoframe catalysts achieved a factor of 36 enhancement in mass activity and a factor of 22 enhancement in specific activity \u2026",
                "To enhance and optimize nanocatalyst performance and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel-cell applications, we look beyond Pt\u2013metal disordered alloys and describe a new class of Pt\u2013Co nanocatalysts composed of ordered Pt 3 Co intermetallic cores with a 2\u20133 atomic-layer-thick platinum shell. These nanocatalysts exhibited over 200% increase in mass activity and over 300% increase in specific activity when compared with the disordered Pt 3 Co alloy nanoparticles as well as Pt\/C. So far, this mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction is the highest among the Pt\u2013Co systems reported in the literature under similar testing conditions. Stability tests showed a minimal loss of activity after 5,000 potential cycles and the ordered core\u2013shell structure was maintained virtually intact, as established by atomic-scale elemental mapping. The high activity and stability are attributed to the Pt-rich shell and the \u2026",
                "Earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition metal\u2013based catalysts have been developed for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER); however, they operate at overpotentials substantially above thermodynamic requirements. Density functional theory suggested that non-3d high-valency metals such as tungsten can modulate 3d metal oxides, providing near-optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates. We developed a room-temperature synthesis to produce gelled oxyhydroxides materials with an atomically homogeneous metal distribution. These gelled FeCoW oxyhydroxides exhibit the lowest overpotential (191 millivolts) reported at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst shows no evidence of degradation after more than 500 hours of operation. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a synergistic interplay between tungsten, iron, and cobalt in producing a favorable \u2026",
                "The accumulation and extrusion of Ca 2+ in the pre-and postsynaptic compartments play a critical role in initiating plastic changes in biological synapses. To emulate this fundamental process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca 2+ dynamics. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle dynamics simulations both demonstrate that Ag atoms disperse under electrical bias and regroup spontaneously under zero bias because of interfacial energy minimization, closely resembling synaptic influx and extrusion of Ca 2+, respectively. The diffusive memristor and its dynamics enable a direct emulation of both short-and long-term plasticity of biological synapses, representing an advance in hardware implementation of neuromorphic functionalities.",
                "The present study sheds light on the long-standing challenges associated with high-voltage operation of LiNi x Mn x Co 1\u2212 2x O 2 cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Using correlated ensemble-averaged high-throughput X-ray absorption spectroscopy and spatially resolved electron microscopy and spectroscopy, here we report structural reconstruction (formation of a surface reduced layer, to transition) and chemical evolution (formation of a surface reaction layer) at the surface of LiNi x Mn x Co 1\u2212 2x O 2 particles. These are primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup under high-voltage cycling conditions, as well as the first-cycle coulombic inefficiency. It was found that the surface reconstruction exhibits a strong anisotropic characteristic, which predominantly occurs along lithium diffusion channels. Furthermore, the surface reaction layer is composed of lithium fluoride \u2026",
                "An understanding of how facets of a nanocrystal develop is critical for controlling nanocrystal shape and designing novel functional materials. However, the atomic pathways of nanocrystal facet development are mostly unknown because of the lack of direct observation. We report the imaging of platinum nanocube growth in a liquid cell using transmission electron microscopy with high spatial and temporal resolution. The growth rates of all low index facets are similar until the {100} facets stop growth. The continuous growth of the rest facets leads to a nanocube. Our calculation shows that the much lower ligand mobility on the {100} facets is responsible for the arresting of {100} growing facets. These findings shed light on nanocrystal shape-control mechanisms and future design of nanomaterials.",
                "A simple method for the preparation of PdCo@Pd core\u2212shell nanoparticles supported on carbon based on an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect has been developed. The stability of these PdCo@Pd nanoparticles and their electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were enhanced by decoration with a small amount of Pt deposited via a spontaneous displacement reaction. The facile method described herein is suitable for large-scale, lower-cost production and significantly lowers the Pt loading and thus the cost. The as-prepared PdCo@Pd and Pd-decorated PdCo@Pd nanocatalysts have a higher methanol tolerance than Pt\/C in the ORR and are promising cathode catalysts for fuel cell applications.",
                "A promising electrocatalyst prototype of low Pt mole fraction, intermetallic nanoparticles of Cu3Pt, has been prepared using a simple impregnation-reduction method, followed by a post heat-treatment. Two dealloying methods (electrochemical and chemical) were implemented to control the atomic-level morphology and improve performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The morphology and elemental composition of the dealloyed nanoparticles were characterized at angstrom resolution using an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with an electron energy loss spectrometer. We found that the electrochemical dealloying method led to the formation of a thin Pt skin of ca. 1 nm in thickness with an ordered Cu3Pt core structure, while chemical leaching gave rise to a \u201cspongy\u201d structure with no ordered structure being preserved.

                "Voltage fade is a major problem in battery applications for high-energy lithium-and manganese-rich (LMR) layered materials. As a result of the complexity of the LMR structure, the voltage fade mechanism is not well understood. Here we conduct both in situ and ex situ studies on a typical LMR material (Li 1.2 Ni 0.15 Co 0.1 Mn 0.55 O 2) during charge\u2013discharge cycling, using multi-length-scale X-ray spectroscopic and three-dimensional electron microscopic imaging techniques. Through probing from the surface to the bulk, and from individual to whole ensembles of particles, we show that the average valence state of each type of transition metal cation is continuously reduced, which is attributed to oxygen release from the LMR material. Such reductions activate the lower-voltage Mn 3+\/Mn 4+ and Co 2+\/Co 3+ redox couples in addition to the original redox couples including Ni 2+\/Ni 3+, Ni 3+\/Ni 4+ and O 2\u2212\/O \u2026",
                "NH3 synthesis by the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is an appealing alternative to the currently employed industrial method\u2014the Haber\u2013Bosch process\u2014that requires high temperature and pressure. We report single Mo atoms anchored to nitrogen\u2010doped porous carbon as a cost\u2010effective catalyst for the NRR. Benefiting from the optimally high density of active sites and hierarchically porous carbon frameworks, this catalyst achieves a high NH3 yield rate (34.0\u00b13.6\u2005\u03bcg \u2009h\u22121\u2009mgcat.\u22121) and a high Faradaic efficiency (14.6\u00b11.6\u2009%) in 0.1\u2009m KOH at room temperature. These values are considerably higher compared to previously reported non\u2010precious\u2010metal electrocatalysts. Moreover, this catalyst displays no obvious current drop during a 50\u2009000\u2005s NRR, and high activity and durability are achieved in 0.1\u2009m HCl. The findings provide a promising lead for the design of \u2026"
