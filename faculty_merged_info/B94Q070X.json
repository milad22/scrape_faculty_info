To pursue this goal, he participates in state-of-the art solar modeling and analysis of helioseismic data. Helioseismology is the first accurate experiment that puts strong constraints on the thermodynamic quantities of the plasma of stellar interiors. \r\n\r\nDappen's own contribution to the field (the Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen equation of state) is currently being used by several international solar and stellar modeling groups.  Research Keywords  Solar and stellar structure, evolution and chemical composition; solar and stellar oscillations; helioseismic diagnosis of the equation of state; theory of reacting hot dense Coulomb plasmas; molecular-dynamics simulations of stellar fusion.
