                "The mechanical properties of pristine graphene oxide paper and paper-like films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-graphene oxide nanocomposite are investigated in a joint experimental\u2013theoretical and computational study. In combination, these studies reveal a delicate relationship between the stiffness of these papers and the water content in their lamellar structures. ReaxFF-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations elucidate the role of water molecules in modifying the mechanical properties of both pristine and nanocomposite graphene oxide papers, as bridge-forming water molecules between adjacent layers in the paper structure enhance stress transfer by means of a cooperative hydrogen-bonding network. For graphene oxide paper at an optimal concentration of \u223c5 wt % water, the degree of cooperative hydrogen bonding within the network comprising adjacent nanosheets and water molecules was found to \u2026"

                "Steve Presse spresse@asu.edu Department of Physics Associate Professor Faculty TEMPE Campus Mailcode 1504 Biography Steve Presse was born in Montreal and went to McGill University as an undergrad where he studied chemistry. He later pursued his doctorate in chemical physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the direction of Professor\u00a0Robert J. Silbey. As a postdoctoral fellow in Professor Ken A. Dill's lab, his research focus shifted to biophysics and dynamical processes in particular. His lab now uses both theory and experiments to address fundamental questions relevant to molecular science. On the theory side, his group develops, adapts and uses the tools of inference, statistical physics and stochastic processes, broadly defined, to understand living systems from single molecules to whole cells. A special emphasis is placed on interpreting spectroscopy and imaging data. On the experimental side, Presse's group investigates the role of hydrodynamics on bacterial interactions. The Presse lab is\u00a0seeking motivated postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students for theoretical or experimental work. If interested, please see the recruiting tab at\u00a0http:\/\/statphysbio.physics.asu.edu\u00a0and\u00a0contact\u00a0 spresse@asu.edu.
