Based upon this guiding principle, our main topics of research are those with great discovery potential. Wu started this task in 1977 when she joined Wisconsin as an assistant professor. In her career so far, she has participated in three major discoveries, in two of which she played a leading role, the gluon and the Higgs boson. Directions to room 4225, Chamberlin Hall or stairs to the 4th floor. Facing into the hallway, away from the two elevators, turn right. Follow the hallway to room 4225, which will be on your left."
