Experimental topics include experiments for plasma waves and instabilities, plasma self-organization and sheaths, and laser-induced fluorescence and wave-absorption diagnostics of plasmas Student projects are\u00a0typically experimental with a significant interaction with\u00a0theory Theoretical topics include plasma kinetic theory including waves and nonlinear fluctuations There are two labs at Iowa, including: a 3-meter linear magnetized-plasma device and a large multi-dipole discharge.\u00a0 Both are equipped with single-frequency scanning lasers for high-resolution laser spectroscopy.\u00a0 Some students also participate in collaborations on the Large Plasma Device located at UCLA Beyond interactions with group members, students participate in the plasma seminar and interact with Departmental theoretical and experimental plasma, space physics, and astronomy faculty Students develop skills including data analysis, high-resolution laser spectroscopy,\u00a0designing and building apparatus, electronics, computation Previous assistants have found employment in academia, national laboratories, and\u00a0in industry Research page"
