                "Changing arterial oxygen content (C) has a highly sensitive influence on the rate of peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue development. We examined the effects of C on exercise performance and its interaction with peripheral quadriceps fatigue. Eight trained males performed four 5 km cycling time trials (power output voluntarily adjustable) at four levels of C (17.6\u201324.4 ml O2 dl\u22121), induced by variations in inspired O2 fraction (0.15\u20131.0). Peripheral quadriceps fatigue was assessed via changes in force output pre\u2010 versus post\u2010exercise in response to supra\u2010maximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation (\u0394Qtw; 1\u2013100 Hz). Central neural drive during the time trials was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram. Increased C from hypoxia to hyperoxia resulted in parallel increases in central neural output (43%) and power output (30%) during cycling and improved time trial performance (12%); however, the magnitude of \u0394 \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND:COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States as well as throughout the rest of the world. An exacerbation of COPD (periodic escalations of symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and sputum production) is a major contributor to worsening lung function, impairment in quality of life, need for urgent care or hospitalization, and cost of care in COPD. Research conducted over the past decade has contributed much to our current understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of COPD. Additionally, an evolving literature has accumulated about the prevention of acute exacerbations.METHODS:In recognition of the importance of preventing exacerbations in patients with COPD, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) joint evidence-based guideline (AECOPD Guideline) was developed to provide a practical, clinically useful document to \u2026",
                "In young, healthy people the alveolar\u2013arterial P difference (A\u2010aDO2) is small at rest, but frequently increases during exercise. Previously, investigators have focused on ventilation\/perfusion mismatch and diffusion abnormalities to explain the impairment in gas exchange, as significant physiological intra\u2010pulmonary shunt has not been found. The aim of this study was to use a non\u2010gas exchange method to determine if anatomical intra\u2010pulmonary (I\u2010P) shunts develop during exercise, and, if so, whether there is a relationship between shunt and increased A\u2010aDO2. Healthy male participants performed graded upright cycling to 90%  while pulmonary arterial (PAP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressures were measured. Blood samples were obtained from the radial artery, cardiac output  was calculated by the direct Fick method and I\u2010P shunt was determined by administering agitated saline during continuous 2\u2010D \u2026",
                "Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) participation is the standard of care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who remain symptomatic despite bronchodilator therapies. However, there are questions about specific aspects of PR programming including optimal site of rehabilitation delivery, components of rehabilitation programming, duration of rehabilitation, target populations and timing of rehabilitation. The present document was compiled to specifically address these important clinical issues, using an evidence-based, systematic review process led by a representative interprofessional panel of experts.The evidence reveals there are no differences in major patient-related outcomes of PR between nonhospital- (community or home sites) or hospital-based sites. There is strong support to recommend that COPD patients initiate PR within one month following an acute exacerbation due to benefits of improved dyspnea, exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life relative to usual care. Moreover, the benefits of PR are evident in both men and women, and in patients with moderate, severe and very severe COPD. The current review also suggests that longer PR programs, beyond six to eight weeks duration, be provided for COPD patients, and that while aerobic training is the foundation of PR, endurance and functional ability may be further improved with both aerobic and resistance training.",
                "Subjects with greater aerobic fitness demonstrate better diastolic compliance at rest, but whether fitness modulates exercise cardiac compliance and cardiac filling pressures remains to be determined. On the basis of maximal oxygen consumption (V\u0307o2max), healthy male subjects were categorized into either low (LO: V\u0307o2max = 43 \u00b1 6 ml\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121; n = 3) or high (HI: V\u0307o2max = 60 \u00b1 3 ml\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121; n = 5) aerobic power. Subjects performed incremental cycle exercise to 90% V\u0307o2max. Right atrial (RAP) and pulmonary artery wedge (PAWP) pressures were measured, and left ventricular (LV) transmural filling pressure (TMFP = PAWP \u2212 RAP) was calculated. Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were determined by direct Fick, and LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) was estimated from echocardiographic fractional area change and Fick SV. There were no between-group differences for any measure at rest \u2026",
                "The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of the 20-m multi-stage shuttle run (SR) test to predict  in young adults.  was measured during a graded treadmill test in 60 men and 62 women (mean age 25.3 and 25.1 years, respectively). Each subject was familiarized with the SR procedure and then completed the SR test to predict  on a separate day. The mean terminal SR stage was 9.5 for men and 7.8 for women. The regression equations of L\u00e9ger et al. (1988) and L\u00e9ger and Gadoury (1989) systematically underpredicted max for both males and females (p\u2002<\u20020.05). New regression equations were developed from present data to predict  for males: \u0176\u2002=\u20022.75X\u2002+\u200228.8 (r2\u2002=\u20020.77, SEE\u2002=\u20024.07 ml\u2022kg\u22121\u2022min\u22121); and for females: \u0176\u2002=\u20022.85X\u2002+\u200225.1 (r2\u2002=\u20020.66, SEE\u2002=\u20023.64 ml\u2022kg\u22121\u2022min\u22121), where X equals the last half-stage of the SR completed. We suggest that these gender-distinct equations provide \u2026",

                "Non\u2010technical summary\u2002 Heat stress reduces brain blood flow and impairs orthostatic tolerance. Brain blood flow is largely controlled by the partial pressure of arterial . Indeed, hyperthermia\u2010induced over\u2010breathing and related reductions in arterial  account for \u223c50% of the reduction in brain blood flow. This investigation tested the unique hypothesis that the distribution of cardiac output during heat stress (challenged by thermoregulatory increases in skin blood flow and sweat loss) contributes to the remaining 50%. We show that cardiac output is not related to brain blood flow, but rather arterial  plays a much larger role than previously suggested. These findings help us understand the mechanisms relating heat stress with an increased likelihood of fainting, and are also relevant to pathological conditions that are accompanied by elevations in body temperature."
