                "Flower-like CuS hollow microspheres composed of nanoflakes have been successfully prepared via a facile solvothermal method. The crystal structure, morphology and microwave absorption properties of the as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a network analyser. The effects of reaction temperature, concentration of the reagents and reaction time on the structures and morphologies of the CuS products were investigated using XRD and SEM techniques. A plausible mechanism for the formation of hollow architectures related to Ostwald ripening was proposed. The CuS\/paraffin composite containing 30 wt% CuS hollow microspheres shows the best microwave absorption properties compared with other CuS\/paraffin composites. The minimum reflection loss of \u221231.5 dB can be observed at 16.7 GHz \u2026"
