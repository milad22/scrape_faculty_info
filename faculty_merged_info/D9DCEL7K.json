                "Brett Andrews Research Assistant Professor 306 Allen Hall (412) 383-8095 andrewsb@pitt.edu My current research focuses on estimating photometric redshifts of galaxies using neural networks (w\/ Biprateep Dey and Jeff Newman) and constraining hard-to-determine properties of our own Galaxy by studying its extragalactic analogs (w\/ Catherine Fielder and Jeff Newman). I am a core developer of Marvin , a data access, exploration, analysis, and visualization toolkit for the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey (w\/ Brian Cherinka, Jose Sanchez-Gallego, and Joel Brownstein). My Ph.D. research explored the growth and evolution of galaxies as traced by changes in the abundance of chemical elements in their gas (w\/ Paul Martini) and stars (w\/ David Weinberg and Jennifer Johnson). I developed a code called flexCE to make theoretical predictions for the chemical evolution of a galaxy over its lifetime. (412) 383-8095"
