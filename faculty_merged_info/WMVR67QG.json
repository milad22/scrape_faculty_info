                "We report the results of a search for \u03bd e appearance in a \u03bd \u03bc beam in the MINOS long-baseline neutrino experiment. With an improved analysis and an increased exposure of 8.2\u00d7 10 20 protons on the NuMI target at Fermilab, we find that 2 sin\ufeff 2 (\u03b8 23) sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 13)< 0.12 (0.20) at 90% confidence level for \u03b4= 0 and the normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, with a best-fit of 2 sin\ufeff 2 (\u03b8 23) sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 13)= 0.041\u2212 0.031+ 0.047 (0.079\u2212 0.053+ 0.071). The \u03b8 13= 0 hypothesis is disfavored by the MINOS data at the 89% confidence level.",
                "This Letter reports results from the MINOS experiment based on its initial exposure to neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. The rates and energy spectra of charged current \u03bd \u03bc interactions are compared in two detectors located along the beam axis at distances of 1 and 735 km. With 1.27\u00d7 10 20 120 GeV protons incident on the NuMI target, 215 events with energies below 30 GeV are observed at the Far Detector, compared to an expectation of 336\u00b114 events. The data are consistent with \u03bd \u03bc disappearance via oscillations with| \u0394 m 32 2|= 2.74\u2212 0.26+ 0.44\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 and sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8 23)> 0.87 (68% CL).",

The possible background of interactions of neutrons and photons produced in muon interactions in the rock surrounding the detector has been investigated and is shown not to produce low values of the ratio.",
                "We report a measurement of the atmospheric neutrino flavor ratio, R, using a sample of quasi-elastic neutrino interactions occurring in an iron medium. The flavor ratio (tracks\/showers) of atmospheric neutrinos in a 3.9 fiducial kiloton-year exposure of Soudan 2 is 0.64\u00b10.11(stat.)\u00b10.06(syst.) of that expected. Important aspects of our main analysis have been checked by carrying out two independent, alternative analyses; one is based upon automated scanning, the other uses a multivariate approach for background subtraction. Similar results are found by all three approaches.",
                "This Letter reports new results from the MINOS experiment based on a two-year exposure to muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Our data are consistent with quantum-mechanical oscillations of neutrino flavor with mass splitting| \u0394 m 2|=(2.43\u00b10.13)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 (68% CL) and mixing angle sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8)> 0.90 (90% CL). Our data disfavor two alternative explanations for the disappearance of neutrinos in flight: namely, neutrino decays into lighter particles and quantum decoherence of neutrinos, at the 3.7 and 5.7 standard-deviation levels, respectively.",
                "Measurements of neutrino oscillations using the disappearance of muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI neutrino beam as observed by the two MINOS detectors are reported. New analysis methods have been applied to an enlarged data sample from an exposure of 7.25\u00d7 10 20 protons on target. A fit to neutrino oscillations yields values of| \u0394 m 2|=(2.32\u2212 0.08+ 0.12)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 eV 2 for the atmospheric mass splitting and sin\ufeff 2 (2 \u03b8)> 0.90 (90% CL) for the mixing angle. Pure neutrino decay and quantum decoherence hypotheses are excluded at 7 and 9 standard deviations, respectively.",
                "The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) experiment uses an accelerator-produced neutrino beam to perform precision measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the \u201catmospheric neutrino\u201d sector associated with muon neutrino disappearance. This long-baseline experiment measures neutrino interactions in Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam with a near detector at Fermilab and again 735 km downstream with a far detector in the Soudan Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota. The two detectors are magnetized steel-scintillator tracking calorimeters. They are designed to be as similar as possible in order to ensure that differences in detector response have minimal impact on the comparisons of event rates, energy spectra and topologies that are essential to MINOS measurements of oscillation parameters.

                "We report measurements of oscillation parameters from \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd \u03bc disappearance using beam and atmospheric data from MINOS.

The data also constrain \u03b4 C P, the \u03b8 23 octant degeneracy and the mass hierarchy; we disfavor 36%(11%) of this three-parameter space at 68%(90%) CL",
                "Large-angle pp elastic and quasielastic (p, 2 p) scattering have been simultaneously observed in hydrogen and each of several nuclear targets (Li, C, Al, Cu, Pb) at incident proton momenta of 6, 10, and 12 GeV\/c. The nuclear transparency is the ratio of such a cross section in a nucleus to the free pp cross section. The transparency of aluminum increases with incident momentum by more than a factor of 2 from 6 to 9.5 GeV\/c and falls significantly between 9.5 and 12 GeV\/c. This occurs in a region where the free-proton nucleon-absorption cross section exhibits little energy dependence. QCD predicts an increase in transparency with energy."
