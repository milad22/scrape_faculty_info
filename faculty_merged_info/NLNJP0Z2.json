                "Integrating patterned, low-loss magnetic materials into microwave devices and circuits presents many challenges due to the specific conditions that are required to grow ferrite materials, driving the need for flip-chip and other indirect fabrication techniques. The low-loss (\u03b1 = (3.98 \u00b1 0.22) \u00d7 10\u22125), room-temperature ferrimagnetic coordination compound vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]x) is a promising new material for these applications that is potentially compatible with semiconductor processing. Here, we present the deposition, patterning, and characterization of V[TCNE]x thin films with lateral dimensions ranging from 1 \u03bcm to several millimeters. We employ electron-beam lithography and liftoff using an aluminum encapsulated poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid) copolymer bilayer [PMMA\/P(MMA-MAA)] on sapphire and silicon. This process can be trivially extended to \u2026"
