                "LOAD ESTimator (LOADEST) is a FORTRAN program for estimating constituent loads in streams and rivers. Given a time series of streamflow, additional data variables, and constituent concentration, LOADEST assists the user in developing a regression model for the estimation of constituent load (calibration). Explanatory variables within the regression model include various functions of streamflow, decimal time, and additional user-specified data variables. The formulated regression model then is used to estimate loads over a user-specified time interval (estimation). Mean load estimates, standard errors, and 95 percent confidence intervals are developed on a monthly and (or) seasonal basis. The calibration and estimation procedures within LOADEST are based on three statistical estimation methods. The first two methods, Adjusted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (AMLE) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), are appropriate when the calibration model errors (residuals) are normally distributed. Of the two, AMLE is the method of choice when the calibration data set (time series of streamflow, additional data variables, and concentration) contains censored data. The third method, Least Absolute Deviation (LAD), is an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation when the residuals are not normally distributed. LOADEST output includes diagnostic tests and warnings to assist the user in determining the appropriate estimation method and in interpreting the estimated loads. This report describes the development and application of LOADEST. Sections of the report describe estimation theory, input\/output specifications, sample applications \u2026",
                "Several recent articles have called attention to the problem of retransformation bias, which can arise when log linear regression models are used to estimate sediment or other constituent loads. In some cases the bias can lead to underestimation of constituent loads by as much as 50%, and several procedures have been suggested for reducing or eliminating it. However, some of the procedures recommended for reducing the bias can actually increase it. This paper compares the bias and variance of three procedures that can be used with log linear regression models: the traditional rating curve estimator, a modified rating curve method, and a minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE). Analytical derivations of the bias and efficiency of all three estimators are presented. It is shown that for many conditions the traditional and the modified estimator can provide satisfactory estimates. However, other conditions \u2026",
                "We consider the appropriateness of \u201crating curves\u201d and other log linear models to estimate the fluvial transport of nutrients. Split\u2010sample studies using data from tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay reveal that a minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE), based on a simple log linear model, provides satisfactory load estimates, even in some cases where the model exhibited significant lack of fit. For total nitrogen (TN) the average difference between the MVUE estimates and the observed loads ranges from \u22128% to + 2% at the four sites. The corresponding range for total phosphorus (TP) is \u22126% to +5%. None of these differences is statistically significant. The observed variability of the MVUE load estimates for TN and TP, which ranges from 7% to 25% depending on the case, is accurately predicted by statistical theory.",
                "Hydroclimatological time series often exhibit trends. While trend magnitude can be determined with little ambiguity, the corresponding statistical significance, sometimes cited to bolster scientific and political argument, is less certain because significance depends critically on the null hypothesis which in turn reflects subjective notions about what one expects to see. We consider statistical trend tests of hydroclimatological data in the presence of long\u2010term persistence (LTP). Monte Carlo experiments employing FARIMA models indicate that trend tests which fail to consider LTP greatly overstate the statistical significance of observed trends when LTP is present. A new test is presented that avoids this problem. From a practical standpoint, however, it may be preferable to acknowledge that the concept of statistical significance is meaningless when discussing poorly understood systems.",
                "An investigation is made of flood quantile estimators which can employ \u201chistorical\u201d and paleoflood information in flood frequency analyses. Two categories of historical information are considered: \u201ccensored\u201d data, where the magnitudes of historical flood peaks are known; and \u201cbinomial\u201d data, where only threshold exceedance information is available. A Monte Carlo study employing the two\u2010parameter lognormal distribution shows that maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) can extract the equivalent of an additional 10\u201330 years of gage record from a 50\u2010year period of historical observation. The MLE routines are shown to be substantially better than an adjusted\u2010moment estimator similar to the one recommended in Bulletin 17B of the United States Water Resources Council Hydrology Committee (1982). The MLE methods performed well even when floods were drawn from other than the assumed lognormal \u2026",
                "This paper extends the work of Gilliom and Helsel (1986) on procedures for estimating descriptive statistics of water quality data that contain \u201cless than\u201d observations. Previously, procedures were evaluated when only one detection limit was present. Here we investigate the performance of estimators for data that have multiple detection limits. Probability plotting and maximum likelihood methods perform substantially better than simple substitution procedures now commonly in use. Therefore simple substitution procedures (e.g., substitution of the detection limit) should be avoided. Probability plotting methods are more robust than maximum likelihood methods to misspecification of the parent distribution and their use should be encouraged in the typical situation where the parent distribution is unknown. When utilized correctly, less than values frequently contain nearly as much information for estimating population \u2026",

                "This paper reviews advances in methods for estimating fluvial transport of suspended sediment and nutrients. Research from the past four years, mostly dealing with estimating monthly and annual loads, is emphasized. However, because this topic has not appeared in previous IUGG reports, some research prior to 1990 is included. The motivation for studying sediment transport has shifted during the past few decades. In addition to its role in filling reservoirs and channels, sediment is increasingly recognized as an important part of fluvial ecosystems and estuarine wetlands. Many groups want information about sediment transport [Bollman, 1992]: Scientists trying to understand benthic biology and catchment hydrology; citizens and policy\u2010makers concerned about environmental impacts (e.g. impacts of logging [Beschta, 1978] or snow\u2010fences [Sturges, 1992]); government regulators considering the effectiveness of \u2026",
                "Estimates of long\u2010term transport of constituents commonly are obtained by summing retransformed estimates from regressions of logarithmically transformed response variables. Typical explanatory variables for these regressions include functions of flow, change in flow, time, and time of year. The mean and mean square error of four estimators of long\u2010term transport at periodically measured stations are presented as a function of the observed values of the explanatory variables from the long\u2010term record and summary statistics of the regression data. Estimates of the mean square errors can be used in designing sampling strategies to attempt to minimize the uncertainty in the estimation of long\u2010term transport subject to a constraint on the number of samples to be taken. This uncertainty is expressed in terms of the explanatory variables in the long\u2010term record, the regression coefficients and standard error of the \u2026",
                "Residential households in Perth, Western Australia have access to privately extracted groundwater as well as a public mains water supply, which has been charged through a two\u2010part block tariff. A contingent valuation approach is developed to estimate price elasticity of demand for public supply. Results are compared with those of a multivariate time series analysis. Validation tests for the contingent approach are proposed, based on a comparison of predicted behaviors following hypothesised price changes with relevant independent data. Properly conducted, the contingent approach appears to be reliable, applicable where the available data do not favor regression analysis, and a fruitful source of information about social, technical, and behavioral responses to change in the price of water."
