                "Recent progress in establishing the capability of radios to operate in full duplex mode on a single channel has been attracting growing attention from many researchers. We extend this work by considering the application to small cells, in particular resource-managed cellular systems similar to the TDD variant of LTE. We derive conditions where full duplex operation provides improved throughput compared to half duplex for a single cell scenario. We present a hybrid scheduler that defaults to half duplex operation but can assign full duplex timeslots when it is advantageous to do so. We compare the performance of such a scheduler with a traditional half duplex scheduler in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. Our simulation results show that we achieve as much as 81% of the capacity doubling promised by full duplex, with limitations deriving from interference effects specific to full duplex operation."
