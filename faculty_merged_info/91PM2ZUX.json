After graduating from an electronics technical school in 1976, he gained experience with installation, repair, maintenance and design in the telecommunications and radio communications industries. Kern began working at WMU in 1997, putting his experience in a wide range of technologies to work maintaining the University's 6MEV Van de Graaff particle accelerator. Kern is proficient in electronic circuit repair and design, which is helpful when maintaining a 40-year-old machine. When equipment in the laboratory fails or manufacturers are no longer in business or can't provide replacement parts, he can design and build new modules as necessary. He also works with professors to design and build experimental systems, and he will often involve students who benefit from this valuable educational experience. Kern recently received a 2019 College of Arts and Sciences Staff Excellence Award . Email Allan Kern"
