                "This article reviews static and dynamic interfacial effects in magnetism, focusing on interfacially driven magnetic effects and phenomena associated with spin-orbit coupling and intrinsic symmetry breaking at interfaces. It provides a historical background and literature survey, but focuses on recent progress, identifying the most exciting new scientific results and pointing to promising future research directions. It starts with an introduction and overview of how basic magnetic properties are affected by interfaces, then turns to a discussion of charge and spin transport through and near interfaces and how these can be used to control the properties of the magnetic layer. Important concepts include spin accumulation, spin currents, spin-transfer torque, and spin pumping. An overview is provided to the current state of knowledge and existing review literature on interfacial effects such as exchange bias, exchange-spring \u2026",
                "The first observation of gravitational waves from the inspiral of a binary neutron star (BNS) 200 system on 2017 August 17 (Abbott et al. 2017b) was a major landmark in multi-messenger astronomy and astrophysics. The gravitational-wave merger was accompanied by a gamma-ray burst (Abbott et al. 2017c; Goldstein et al. 2017; Savchenko et al. 2017); the subsequent world-wide follow-up of the signal by electromagnetic telescopes and satellite observatories identified the host galaxy and observed the kilonova and afterglow emission of the event over a period of hours to months (see, for example, Abbott et al. 2017d and references therein; Villar et al. 2017; Hajela et al. 2019; Troja et al. 2019).",
                "A new microcalorimeter for measuring heat capacity of thin films in the range 1.5\u2013800 K is described. Semiconductor processing techniques are used to create a device with an amorphous silicon nitride membrane as the sample substrate, a Pt thin film resistor for temperatures greater than 40 K, and either a thin film amorphous Nb\u2013Si or a novel boron\u2010doped polycrystalline silicon thermometer for lower temperatures. The addenda of the device, including substrate, is 4\u00d710\u22126 J\/K at room temperature and 2\u00d710\u22129 J\/K at 4.3 K, approximately two orders of magnitude less than any existing calorimeter used for measuring thin films. The device is capable of measuring the heat capacity of thin film samples as small as a few micrograms.",
                "We report on the doping dependence of the order of the ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator phase transition in L a 1\u2212 x C a x M n O 3. At x= 0.33, magnetization and specific heat data show a first order transition, with an entropy change (2.3 J\/m o l K) accounted for by both volume expansion and the discontinuity of M\u223c 1.7 \u03bc B via the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. At x= 0.4, the data show a continuous transition with tricritical point exponents \u03b1= 0.48\u00b10.06, \u03b2= 0.25\u00b10.03, \u03b3= 1.03\u00b10.05, and \u03b4= 5.0\u00b10.8. This tricritical point separates first-(x< 0.4) from second-order (x> 0.4) transitions.",
                "The first two observing runs (O1 and O2) with Advanced LIGO\uf0a0(Aasi et al. 2015) and Advanced Virgo\uf0a0(Acernese et al. 2015) opened up the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics with the detection of the first binary black hole (BBH) coalescence signal, GW150914\uf0a0(Abbott et al. 2016a). Another nine such events (Abbott et al. 2016b, 2019a) were discovered by the LIGO",
                "Levitation of a magnet over a type II superconductor where the field at the superconductor exceeds Hc1 is described and shown. The penetration and pinning of the flux lines in the superconductor cause the position of the magnet to be stable over a flat disk; a complete Meissner effect would make this position unstable. Furthermore, the observed dependence of the height of levitation on such variables as the thickness of the superconducting disk and the size of the magnet are consistent with a model described in this paper based on the energy cost of flux penetration through vortices and inconsistent with a Meissner effect model.",
                "On May 21, 2019 at 03: 02: 29 UTC Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observed a short duration gravitational-wave signal, GW190521, with a three-detector network signal-to-noise ratio of 14.7, and an estimated false-alarm rate of 1 in 4900 yr using a search sensitive to generic transients. If GW190521 is from a quasicircular binary inspiral, then the detected signal is consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses of 8 5\u2212 14+ 21 M\u2299 and 6 6\u2212 18+ 17 M\u2299(90% credible intervals). We infer that the primary black hole mass lies within the gap produced by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova processes, with only a 0.32% probability of being below 65 M\u2299. We calculate the mass of the remnant to be 14 2\u2212 16+ 28 M\u2299, which can be considered an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The luminosity distance of the source is 5.3\u2212 2.6+ 2.4 Gpc, corresponding to a redshift of 0.82\u2212 0.34+ 0.28. The inferred \u2026",
                "Magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat measurements were made on a single crystal of La 0.75 Sr 0.25 MnO 3. The ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition was found at 346 K and four critical exponents were measured as: \u03b1= 0.05\u00b10. 0 7, \u03b2= 0.40\u00b10. 0 2, \u03b3= 1.27\u00b10. 0 6, and \u03b4= 4.12\u00b10.33. The values of critical exponents are all between mean-field values and three-dimensional-(3D)-Ising-model values. The scaling behavior is well obeyed for all measurements, and the associated exponent relations are well satisfied, validating the critical analysis. Although the cubic crystal structure of this material makes the 3D Heisenberg the expected model, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy arising from the shape of the sample causes the 3D Ising model to be important within the experimental temperature range.",
                "We report the thermal conductivity and specific heat of amorphous silicon thin films measured from 5\u2013300 K using silicon-nitride membrane-based microcalorimeters. Above 50 K the thermal conductivity of thin-film amorphous silicon agrees with values previously reported by other authors. However, our data show no plateau, with a low T suppression of the thermal conductivity that suggests that the scattering of long wavelength, low Q vibrations goes as Q 2. The specific heat shows Debye-like behavior below 15 K, with \u03b8 D= 487\u00b15 K, and is consistent with a very small contribution of tunneling states in amorphous silicon. Above 15 K, the specific heat deviates less from Debye behavior than does its crystalline allotrope, indicating no significant excess modes (boson peak) in amorphous silicon.",
                "We present values of the specific heat and thermal conductivity from 3\u2013300 K of low-stress amorphous silicon-nitride thin-films determined from measurements using a membrane-based microcalorimeter. The thermal conductivity has a temperature dependence often seen in amorphous solids, but the magnitude is large, with the expected plateau occurring at significantly higher temperatures than seen in other amorphous systems. Specific heat measurements show that the expected \u2018peak\u2019 in the vibrational spectrum also occurs at relatively high temperatures. The estimated phonon mean-free-path at 300 K is \u22485 \u00c5, comparable to the inter-atomic spacing, as seen in other amorphous solids. Below \u2248 20 K the mean free path is comparable to or exceeds the thickness of the membrane, indicating that surface scattering dominates the thermal transport. This surface scattering is found to be either specular or diffuse \u2026"

She received her PhD in Applied Physics from Stanford University in 1985, studying what were then considered the high Tc superconductors (the A15's). After a 2 year post-doc in thin film magnetism at AT&T Bell Labs, she went to UCSD as an assistant professor in 1987, where she received tenure in 1994 and became a full professor in 2000. She joined the Physics Dept at UC Berkeley in Jan 2005, and became Chair of the Department in 2007. She stepped down as Chair on July 1, 2013, after serving 6 years. In addition to her work in the Physics Department, she has an appointment in the UCB Materials Science and Engineering Dept. as well as at LBNL in the Materials Sciences Division. She has been on a large number of national and local science boards, including the NSF Advisory Board on Math and Physical Sciences, the NRC Board on Physics and Astronomy, the NRC Solid State Sciences Committee, the DOE Division of Materials Science and Engineering Council, ICAM (Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter), the APS Committee on the Status of Women in Physics, the APS Panel on Public Policy, the editorial board for the Review of Scientific Instruments, the Elementary Institute of Science (in San Diego), COSMOS, a statewide math and science summer program for high school students, and the SF Exploratorium. For many years, she ran the NSF-REU site program at the UCSD Physics Dept. and has supervised many student theses, both undergraduate and graduate. She won the APS Keithley Award in 2006, \"In recognition of using emerging micromachining techniques to significantly extend the range of calorimetry into the realm of nanoscale science by construction of Si based microcalorimeters capable of operating in extreme environments with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy\", is a Fellow of the APS, and has been Chair of both the APS Division of Materials Physics and the APS Topical Group on Magnetism and its Applications. Our group studies thermodynamic and temperature-dependent properties of materials. We have developed a series of experiments based on MEMS \"lab-on-a-chip\" devices utilizing a silicon nitride membrane as a thermal isolation platform which allows us to study orders of magnitude smaller sample sizes than other available thermodynamic measurements such as thin films (as thin as 20nm), nanoparticles, and tiny crystals. Experiments include heat capacity measurements, thermal conductivity and thermopower measurements. We have modified this membrane-based device into a portable heater stage that is transparent to x-rays for use in in-situ temperature-dependent measurements in facilities that do not support macroscale heating such as sensitive x-ray beamlines at synchrotrons. Our latest development of the device consists in adding a thin biaxially oriented MgO layer for epitaxial growth of thin films on the amorphous silicon nitride membrane. We study a wide range of materials; current projects include ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic thin films and nanoparticles, studying the effects of disorder on the magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic properties of magnetic materials and relaxor ferroelectrics, and low temperature thermal properties of amorphous materials. We currently have openings for graduate students in a variety of projects, including studying the thermodynamics of magnetocaloric materials, multilayers systems, semiconductor nanowires, and various magnetic materials. Here you can download posters showing the direction of our magnetic research ( PDF ), and with heat capacity measurements ( PDF ).
