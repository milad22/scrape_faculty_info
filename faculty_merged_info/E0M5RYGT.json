                "The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) would show that lepton number is violated, reveal that neu-trinos are Majorana particles, and provide information on neutrino mass. A discovery-capable experiment covering the inverted ordering region, with effective Majorana neutrino masses of 15 \u2212 50 meV, will require a tonne-scale experiment with excellent energy resolution and extremely low backgrounds, at the level of \u223c0.1 count \/(FWHM\u00b7t\u00b7yr) in the region of the signal. The current generation 76Ge experiments GERDA and the Majorana Demonstrator, utilizing high purity Germanium detectors with an intrinsic energy resolution of 0.12%, have achieved the lowest backgrounds by over an order of magnitude in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signal region of all 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 experiments. Building on this success, the LEGEND collaboration has been formed to pursue a tonne-scale 76Ge experiment. The collaboration aims to \u2026"
