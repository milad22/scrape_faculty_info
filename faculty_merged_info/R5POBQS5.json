                "This author introduces a framework to guide researchers into a process of racial and cultural awareness, consciousness, and positionality as they conduct education research. The premise of the argument is that dangers seen, unseen, and unforeseen can emerge for researchers when they do not pay careful attention to their own and others\u2019 racialized and cultural systems of coming to know, knowing, and experiencing the world. Education research is used as an analytic site for discussion throughout this article, but the framework may be transferable to other academic disciplines. After a review of literature on race and culture in education and an outline of central tenets of critical race theory, a nonlinear framework is introduced that focuses on several interrelated qualities: researching the self, researching the self in relation to others, engaged reflection and representation, and shifting from the self to system.",
                "Start Where You Are, But Don\u2019t Stay There is a book mainly intended for use by teachers, but would also be beneficial to anyone working with children on a regular basis (including but not limited to administrators, researchers, guidance counselors, and coaches). The author of the book, Milner, focuses on issues of diversity, opportunity, and teaching in the educational setting and the interrelated connection between the three ideas. He decides to focus on these issues because of the \u201cachievement gap\u201d between white and non-white students that currently exists in the US White students consistently perform better than their minority counterparts in the educational setting. He takes a very different approach to this topic, however. Instead of placing emphasis on the achievement gap, he chooses to view this issue in terms of an \u201copportunity gap.\u201d While many researchers and educators seem to concentrate on standardized test scores, Milner decides to focus more on the process of teaching the individual student rather than test results. His tactic of focusing on teaching rather than testing proves to be an insightful one. The author identifies five critical areas that must be addressed in order to eliminate these opportunity gaps: 1) color blindness, 2) cultural conflicts, 3) myth of meritocracy, 4) low expectations and deficit mind-sets, and 5) context-neutral mind-sets.Many US teachers operate under the premise of color blindness. They do not see race as an issue in the classroom and refuse to acknowledge it. If many teachers do this, the author argues that it is because they feel that if they do consider race as a factor. The author rejects this point of view and \u2026",
                "A few years ago, I was invited to a small Midwestern district to speak with district teachers, counselors, administrators, and staff about \u201cCulture and Teaching.\u201d Upon my arrival to the district office, the superintendent greeted me in the parking lot and rushed me into his vehicle. He explained as he started the car, and began driving that he wanted me to \u201csee\u201d one of the district\u2019s \u201curban\u201d schools before my presentation.I did not say much, as I was driven through the stoplights and around the two lane curves. I was perplexed. As I glanced out the window of his car, I pondered: Is this what he classifies as \u201curban\u201d\u2014I saw no sights that resembled an urban environment at least in terms of the layout or structure of the town. This was not an urban district in my mind; it was a rural one. All the data that I had reviewed before my visit about the town\/district also suggested that the district was indeed rural. However, for this \u2026",
                "In The Report of the AERA Panel on Research and Teacher Education, Cochran-Smith and Zeichner's (2005) review of studies in the field of teacher education revealed that many studies lacked theoretical and conceptual grounding. The author argues that Derrick Bell's (1980) interest convergence, a principle of critical race theory, can be used as an analytic, explanatory, and conceptual tool in the study and analyses of policies and practices in teacher education. In particular, the author outlines interest convergence as a tenet of critical race theory, conceptualizes some broad themes of \u201craced\u201d interests in teacher education, applies the interest-convergence principle to teacher education, and introduces an evolving theory of disruptive movement in teacher education to fight against racism in teacher education policies and practices.",
                "Several concepts that are important for inclusion in any teacher education curriculum regarding diversity studies are elucidated in this article. The framing question of the discussion is: What are some relevant conceptions regarding issues of diversity that every teacher education program should consider including in its curriculum? The author outlines important concepts that contribute to what he calls teachers\u2019 conceptual repertoires of diversity. The concepts are: color-blindness, cultural conflict, meritocracy, deficit conceptions, and expectations. The idea is that when teachers enter teacher education, their conceptions\u2014their mindset, thinking, belief systems, attitudes, and overall understanding of the teaching and learning exchange\u2014need to be addressed because these conceptions shape their curricula and instructional practices with P-12 students. The author is not suggesting that the five conceptual repertoires \u2026",
                "In this chapter, I explore poverty as an outside-of-school factor and its influence on the inside-of-school experiences and outcome of students. I consider the interconnected space of learning, instructional practices, and poverty. In particular, I use critical race theory as an analytic tool to unpack, shed light on, problematize, disrupt, and analyze how systems of oppression, marginalization, racism, inequity, hegemony, and discrimination are pervasively present and ingrained in the fabric of policies, practices, institutions, and systems in education that have important bearings on students\u2014all students\u2014even though most of the studies reviewed did not address race in this way. I analyze the interrelationship between race and poverty. My point in using race as an analytic site is not to suggest that people are in poverty because of their race but to demonstrate how race can be a salient factor in how people experience and \u2026",
                "While it is well established that the ability of teachers to build cultural competence is a critical aspect of their work especially in urban and highly diverse settings, the kinds of experiences that help them build cultural competence is less clear. The author attempts to contribute to this void by showcasing a White, science teacher\u2019s experiences in building cultural competence in a highly diverse urban school. Culturally relevant pedagogy is used as an analytic tool to explain and uncover the ways in which the teacher develops cultural knowledge to maximize student learning opportunities. The basic premise of the article is that this White teacher was able to build cultural congruence with his highly diverse learners because he developed cultural competence and concurrently deepened his knowledge and understanding of himself and his practices. Practicing teachers, teacher educators, and researchers are \u2026",
                "The purpose of this qualitative investigation was to understand the sources of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) for an African American teacher in a suburban high school in the United States. As one of only three African American teachers in the school, she encountered many challenges that could have threatened her sense of efficacy and thus caused her to leave the school, yet she persevered. We attempted to identify and interpret the sources of efficacy that encouraged the teacher's persistence in an unsupportive environment. In addition, we considered how the concept of stereotype threat might help us better understand the teacher's situation. Findings of the case study have implications for teacher self-efficacy theory and research, as well as teacher persistence.",
                "Based on the premise that teachers\u2019 perceptions of their professional roles are closely linked to their self images and their impact on the learning and achievement of their students, a study was conducted to investigate the relationship between the context of teachers\u2019 work and their views of themselves as professionals. Sixty teachers in Israeli vocational senior high schools participated in the study. Half taught high-achieving and half low-achieving students. Teachers\u2019 professional images of self were uncovered by asking them to match their images of themselves as teachers with drawings of other, carefully chosen, occupations and to comment on their choices. The use of metaphoric pictures was found to be a meaningful vehicle for raising teachers\u2019 awareness of their roles and functions in school. The major finding of this study was that the teaching context has a significant impact on teachers\u2019 images of their \u2026",
                "Several essential interactions or experiences that had an influence on preservice teachers\u2019 learning and understanding about urban education and diversity are described and discussed. In particular, the author introduces a developmental typology that was used to analyze the preservice teachers\u2019 learning and understanding as a result of a course designed to help preservice teachers develop the knowledge, skills, dispositions, and attitudes necessary to teach in highly diverse and urban school contexts. These developmental interactions that made a critical difference in the preservice teachers\u2019 learning included cultural and racial awareness and insight, critical reflection, and a bridge between theory and practice. Understanding the influence of courses in teacher education that endeavor to provide learning spaces for preservice teachers is especially important as we document the most salient ways to provide all \u2026"

MILNER Professor of Physics milner@mit.edu (617) 258-5439 26-411 Anna Marie Convertino (617) 253-2391 RELATED LINKS: MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science (LNS) The HERMES Experiment, DESY, Hamburg Area of Physics Experimental Nuclear Physics > Laboratory for Nuclear Science > Hadronic Physics Group Professor Milner is  a member of  Laboratory for Nuclear Science's Hadronic Physics Group . His research is focused on studying the spin structure of strongly interacting systems. A major focus of his research effort over the last decade has been the HERMES experiment to study the spin structure of the nucleon. This work was carried out in collaboration with Prof. Robert P. Redwine . HERMES has provided important new data on the flavor decomposition of the quark spin and on the contribution of the glue, yielding a number of new, unexpected results. One of Prof. Milner's most recent efforts was at the MIT Bates Linear Accelerator Center, where the construction of a new large detector called the \" Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid \" (BLAST) was completed. This work was carried out in collaboration with Profs. Bill Bertozzi , Haiyan Gao , June Matthews , and Bob Redwine . BLAST is used with the stored polarized beam to measure spin-dependent electron scattering from polarized hydrogen, deuterium and He-3 targets. BLAST provides important information on the spin structure of light nuclei as well as on the neutron form-factors. Professor Richard Milner joined the MIT faculty  in 1988, where he served as Director of the Bates Linear Accelerator  Center, and  Director of MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. He  received his B.Sc. in 1978 and his M.Sc. in 1979 in Physics from the University College, Cork, Ireland , and his Ph.D., also in Physics, in 1984 from the California Institute of Technology, where he was was a Research Fellow from 1985 to 1988.
