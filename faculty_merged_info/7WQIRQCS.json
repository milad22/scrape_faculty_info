                "We have achieved mobilities in excess of 200,000 cm2 V \u22121 s\u22121 at electron densities of \u223c2 \u00d71011 cm\u22122 by suspending single layer graphene. Suspension \u223c150 nm above a Si\/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene.",
                "The quantum Hall effect (QHE), one example of a quantum phenomenon that occurs on a truly macroscopic scale, has attracted intense interest since its discovery in 1980 and has helped elucidate many important aspects of quantum physics. It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.",
                "A remarkable manifestation of the quantum character of electrons in matter is offered by graphene, a single atomic layer of graphite. Unlike conventional solids where electrons are described with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, electronic excitations in graphene are governed by the Dirac hamiltonian 1. Some of the intriguing electronic properties of graphene, such as massless Dirac quasiparticles with linear energy\u2013momentum dispersion, have been confirmed by recent observations 2, 3, 4, 5. Here, we report an infrared spectromicroscopy study of charge dynamics in graphene integrated in gated devices. Our measurements verify the expected characteristics of graphene and, owing to the previously unattainable accuracy of infrared experiments, also uncover significant departures of the quasiparticle dynamics from predictions made for Dirac fermions in idealized, free-standing graphene. Several observations reported \u2026",
                "The quantum Hall (QH) effect in two-dimensional electrons and holes in high quality graphene samples is studied in strong magnetic fields up to 45 T. QH plateaus at filling factors \u03bd= 0,\u00b11,\u00b14 are discovered at magnetic fields B> 20 T, indicating the lifting of the fourfold degeneracy of the previously observed QH states at \u03bd=\u00b14 (| n|+ 1\/2), where n is the Landau-level index. In particular, the presence of the \u03bd= 0,\u00b11 QH plateaus indicates that the Landau level at the charge neutral Dirac point splits into four sublevels, lifting sublattice and spin degeneracy. The QH effect at \u03bd=\u00b14 is investigated in a tilted magnetic field and can be attributed to lifting of the spin degeneracy of the n= 1 Landau level.",
                "We report infrared studies of the Landau level (LL) transitions in single layer graphene. Our specimens are density tunable and show in situ half-integer quantum Hall plateaus. Infrared transmission is measured in magnetic fields up to B= 18 T at selected LL fillings. Resonances between hole LLs and electron LLs, as well as resonances between hole and electron LLs, are resolved. Their transition energies are proportional to B, and the deduced band velocity is c\u2248 1.1\u00d7 10 6 m\/s. The lack of precise scaling between different LL transitions indicates considerable contributions of many-particle effects to the infrared transition energies.",
                "Graphene nanoribbons will be essential components in future graphene nanoelectronics 1. However, in typical nanoribbons produced from lithographically patterned exfoliated graphene, the charge carriers travel only about ten nanometres between scattering events, resulting in minimum sheet resistances of about one kilohm per square 2, 3, 4, 5. Here we show that 40-nanometre-wide graphene nanoribbons epitaxially grown on silicon carbide 6, 7 are single-channel room-temperature ballistic conductors on a length scale greater than ten micrometres, which is similar to the performance of metallic carbon nanotubes. This is equivalent to sheet resistances below 1 ohm per square, surpassing theoretical predictions for perfect graphene 8 by at least an order of magnitude. In neutral graphene ribbons, we show that transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent; the other is \u2026",
                "We investigate the quantum Hall (QH) states near the charge-neutral Dirac point of a high mobility graphene sample in high magnetic fields. We find that the QH states at filling factors \u03bd=\u00b11 depend only on the perpendicular component of the field with respect to the graphene plane, indicating that they are not spin related. A nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the activation energy gap at filling factor \u03bd= 1 suggests a many-body origin. We therefore propose that the \u03bd= 0 and\u00b11 states arise from the lifting of the spin and sublattice degeneracy of the n= 0 Landau level, respectively.",
                "We report on infrared spectroscopy of bilayer graphene integrated in gated structures. We observe a significant asymmetry in the optical conductivity upon electrostatic doping of electrons and holes. We show that this finding arises from a marked asymmetry between the valence and conduction bands, which is mainly due to the inequivalence of the two sublattices within the graphene layer and the next-nearest-neighbor interlayer coupling. From the conductivity data, the energy difference of the two sublattices and the interlayer coupling energy are directly determined.",
                "We report on electronic properties of graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper then transferred to SiO2\/Si. Wafer-scale (up to 4 in.) graphene films have been synthesized, consisting dominantly of monolayer graphene as indicated by spectroscopic Raman mapping. Low temperature transport measurements are performed on microdevices fabricated from such CVD graphene, displaying ambipolar field effect (with on\/off ratio \u223c5 and carrier mobilities up to \u223c3000\u2002cm2\/V\u2009s) and \u201chalf-integer\u201d quantum Hall effect, a hall-mark of intrinsic electronic properties of monolayer graphene. We also observe weak localization and extract information about phase coherence and scattering of carriers.",
                "We present the first measurements of cyclotron resonance of electrons and holes in bilayer graphene. In magnetic fields up to B= 18 T, we observe four distinct intraband transitions in both the conduction and valence bands. The transition energies are roughly linear in B between the lowest Landau levels, whereas they follow B for the higher transitions. This highly unusual behavior represents a change from a parabolic to a linear energy dispersion. The density of states derived from our data generally agrees with the existing lowest order tight binding calculation for bilayer graphene. However, in comparing data to theory, a single set of fitting parameters fails to describe the experimental results."
