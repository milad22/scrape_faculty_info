                "W. Andreas Schroeder, PhD Professor 2348 SES (312) 996-2974 andreas@uic.edu Professor Schroeder's research area is ultrafast laser spectroscopy - the dynamic resolution of the fundamental physical processes occurring in matter using sub-picosecond (<10^-12s) pulses of laser radiation. Professor Schroeder has received awards for both his teaching and his research: a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award in 1998 and the Provost's Award for Excellence in Teaching (AET) in 2005.
