                "Parity-time (P T) symmetric periodic structures, near the spontaneous P T-symmetry breaking point, can act as unidirectional invisible media. In this regime, the reflection from one end is diminished while it is enhanced from the other. Furthermore, the transmission coefficient and phase are indistinguishable from those expected in the absence of a grating. The phenomenon is robust even in the presence of Kerr nonlinearities, and it can also effectively suppress optical bistabilities.",
                "We show that nonlinear optical structures involving a balanced gain-loss profile can act as unidirectional optical valves. This is made possible by exploiting the interplay between the fundamental symmetries of parity (P) and time (T), with optical nonlinear effects. This unidirectional dynamics is specifically demonstrated for the case of an integrable PT-symmetric nonlinear system.",
                "We introduce here the concept of acoustic parity-time (P T) symmetry and demonstrate the extraordinary scattering characteristics of the acoustic P T medium. On the basis of exact calculations, we show how an acoustic P T-symmetric medium can become unidirectionally transparent at given frequencies. Combining such a P T-symmetric medium with transformation acoustics, we design two-dimensional symmetric acoustic cloaks that are unidirectionally invisible in a prescribed direction. Our results open new possibilities for designing functional acoustic devices with directional responses.",
                "A mechanism for asymmetric transport which is based on parity-time-symmetric nonlinearities is presented. We show that in contrast to the case of conservative nonlinearities, an increase of the complementary conductance strength leads to a simultaneous increase of asymmetry and transmittance intensity. We experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon using a pair of coupled Van der Pol oscillators as a reference system, each with complementary anharmonic gain and loss conductances, connected to transmission lines. An equivalent optical setup is also proposed.",
                "We show both theoretically and experimentally that a pair of inductively coupled active LRC circuits (dimer), one with amplification and another with an equivalent amount of attenuation, display all the features which characterize a wide class of non-Hermitian systems which commute with the joint parity-time  operator: typical normal modes, temporal evolution, and scattering processes. Utilizing a Liouvilian formulation, we can define an underlying -symmetric Hamiltonian, which provides important insight for understanding the behavior of the system. When the -dimer is coupled to transmission lines, the resulting scattering signal reveals novel features which reflect the -symmetry of the scattering target. Specifically we show that the device can show two different behaviors simultaneously, an amplifier or an absorber, depending on the direction and phase relation of the interrogating waves.

                "We show that complex P T-symmetric photonic lattices can lead to a new class of self-imaging Talbot effects. For this to occur, we find that the input field pattern has to respect specific periodicities dictated by the symmetries of the system. While at the spontaneous P T-symmetry breaking point the image revivals occur at Talbot lengths governed by the characteristics of the passive lattice, at the exact phase it depends on the gain and loss parameter, thus allowing one to control the imaging process.",
                "Parity-time (PT) symmetric systems experience phase transition between PT exact and broken phases at exceptional point. These PT phase transitions contribute significantly to the design of single mode lasers, coherent perfect absorbers, isolators, and diodes. However, such exceptional points are extremely difficult to access in practice because of the dispersive behaviour of most loss and gain materials required in PT symmetric systems. Here we introduce a method to systematically tame these exceptional points and control PT phases. Our experimental demonstration hinges on an active acoustic element that realizes a complex-valued potential and simultaneously controls the multiple interference in the structure. The manipulation of exceptional points offers new routes to broaden applications for PT symmetric physics in acoustics, optics, microwaves and electronics, which are essential for sensing \u2026",
                "The beat time \u03c4 fpt associated with the energy transfer between two coupled oscillators is dictated by the bandwidth theorem which sets a lower bound \u03c4 fpt\u223c 1\/\u03b4 \u03c9. We show, both experimentally and theoretically, that two coupled active LRC electrical oscillators with parity-time (PT) symmetry bypass the lower bound imposed by the bandwidth theorem, reducing the beat time to zero while retaining a real valued spectrum and fixed eigenfrequency difference \u03b4 \u03c9. Our results foster design strategies which lead to (stable) pseudounitary wave evolution, and may allow for ultrafast computation, telecommunication, and signal processing.",
                "We show that Fano resonances created by two \ud835\udcab\ud835\udcaf -symmetric nonlinear micro-resonators coupled to a waveguide, have line-shape and resonance position that depends on the direction of the incident light. We utilize these features in order to induce asymmetric transport, up to 47 dBs, in the optical C-window. Our theoretical proposal requires low input power and does not compromise the power or frequency characteristics of the output signal.",
                "We theoretically investigate the flow of electromagnetic waves in complex honeycomb photonic lattices with local PT symmetries. Such PT structure is introduced via a judicious arrangement of gain and loss across the honeycomb lattice, characterized by a gain and loss parameter \u03b3. We found a class of conical diffraction phenomena where the formed cone is brighter and travels along the lattice with a transverse speed proportional to \u03b3."
