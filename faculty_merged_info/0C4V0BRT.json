                "NMR spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful technique to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. Fundamentals of Protein NMR Spectroscopy is a comprehensive textbook that guides the reader from a basic understanding of the phenomenological properties of magnetic resonance to the application and interpretation of modern multi-dimensional NMR experiments on 15N\/13C-labeled proteins. Beginning with elementary quantum mechanics, a set of practical rules is presented and used to describe many commonly employed multi-dimensional, multi-nuclear NMR pulse sequences. A modular analysis of NMR pulse sequence building blocks also provides a basis for understanding and developing novel pulse programs. This text not only covers topics from chemical shift assignment to protein structure refinement, as well as the analysis of protein dynamics and chemical kinetics, but also provides a practical guide to many aspects of modern spectrometer hardware, sample preparation, experimental set-up, and data processing. End of chapter exercises are included to emphasize important concepts. Fundamentals of Protein NMR Spectroscopy not only offer students a systematic, in-depth, understanding of modern NMR spectroscopy and its application to biomolecular systems, but will also be a useful reference for the experienced investigator.",
                "In vivo cell tracking by MRI can provide means to observe biological processes and monitor cell therapy directly. Immune cells, e.g., macrophages, play crucial roles in many pathophysiological processes, including organ rejection, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, cancer, atherosclerotic plaque formation, numerous neurological disorders, etc. The current gold standard for diagnosing and staging rejection after organ transplantation is biopsy, which is not only invasive, but also prone to sampling errors. Here, we report a noninvasive approach using MRI to detect graft rejection after solid organ transplantation. In addition, we present the feasibility of imaging individual macrophages in vivo by MRI in a rodent heterotopic working-heart transplantation model using a more sensitive contrast agent, the micrometer-sized paramagnetic iron oxide particle, as a methodology to detect acute cardiac rejection.",
                "To enable accurate magnetic resonance (MR) parameter mapping with accelerated data acquisition, utilizing recent advances in constrained imaging with sparse sampling.A new constrained reconstruction method based on low\u2010rank and sparsity constraints is proposed to accelerate MR parameter mapping. More specifically, the proposed method simultaneously imposes low\u2010rank and joint sparse structures on contrast\u2010weighted image sequences within a unified mathematical formulation. With a pre\u2010estimated subspace, this formulation results in a convex optimization problem, which is solved using an efficient numerical algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers.To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, two application examples were considered: (i) T2 mapping of the human brain and (ii) T1 mapping of the rat brain. For each \u2026",
                "Current diagnosis of organ rejection following transplantation relies on tissue biopsy, which is not ideal due to sampling limitations and risks associated with the invasive procedure.We have previously shown that cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of iron\u2010oxide labeled immune\u2010cell infiltration can provide a noninvasive measure of rejection status by detecting areas of hypointensity on T\u2010weighted images. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using a fluorine\u2010based cellular tracer agent to detect macrophage accumulation in rodent models of acute allograft rejection by fluorine\u201019 (19F) MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This study used two rat models of acute rejection, including abdominal heterotopic cardiac transplant and orthotopic kidney transplant models.

They have also demonstrated potential clinical efficacy in combating HIV-1, on the basis of a preliminary study. Our prior publications have discussed the discovery of this series of compounds and reported some preliminary chemical and biological studies around N-6 substitutions and 5-membered ring variations of 1. This manuscript describes our synthetic endeavors around 4, 5, and 7 mono- and disubstitutions of 1 and discusses related HIV-1 inhibitory structure-activity relationships. On the basis of inhibition of HIV-l\u2019s cytopathic effects in MT-4 cells, we found that 5-mono-Me-substituted analogues, the original substitution in the early lead compounds, and 7-mono-Me-substituted analogues of 1 were \u2026",
                "A novel dual-mode contrast agent was formulated through the addition of an optical near infrared (NIR) probe to a perfluorocarbon (PFC)-based 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agent, which labels inflammatory cells in situ. A single PFC-NIR imaging agent enables both a qualitative, rapid optical monitoring of an inflammatory state and a quantitative, detailed and tissue-depth independent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The feasibility of in vivo optical imaging of the inflammatory response was demonstrated in a subcutaneous murine breast carcinoma model. Ex vivo optical imaging was used to quantify the PFC-NIR signal in the tumor and organs, and results correlated well with quantitative 19F NMR analyses of intact tissues. 19F MRI was employed to construct a three-dimensional image of the cellular microenvironment at the tumor site. Flow cytometry of isolated tumor cells was used to identify the \u2026",
                "A general-purpose Monte Carlo assignment program has been developed to aid in the assignment of NMR resonances from proteins. By virtue of its flexible data requirements the program is capable of obtaining assignments of both heavily deuterated and fully protonated proteins. A wide variety of source data, such as inter-residue scalar connectivity, inter-residue dipolar (NOE) connectivity, and residue specific information, can be utilized in the assignment process. The program can also use known assignments from one form of a protein to facilitate the assignment of another form of the protein. This attribute is useful for assigning protein-ligand complexes when the assignments of the unliganded protein are known. The program can be also be used as an interactive research tool to assist in the choice of additional experimental data to facilitate completion of assignments.

                "PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of obtaining reproducible apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of normal rat kidneys by using respiratory-triggered spin-echo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, to investigate the sensitivity of ADC maps in the evaluation of renal blood flow, and to use this technique to monitor acute graft rejection in transplanted rat kidneys.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spin-echo diffusion-weighted MR imaging measurements were performed in 20 normal rats and nine rats that had undergone transplantation (six rats had received allografts; three had received isografts) at 7 T. To evaluate the effect of alteration in blood flow and water transport function, angiotensin II was infused in six normal rats and a series of spin-echo diffusion-weighted MR images was obtained at five time points. Transplanted kidneys were monitored by obtaining spin-echo diffusion \u2026",
                "Background\u2014 Long-term survival of heart transplants is hampered by chronic rejection (CR). Studies indicate the involvement of host macrophages in the development of CR; however, the precise role of these cells in CR is unclear. Thus, it is important to develop noninvasive techniques to serially monitor the movement and distribution of recipient macrophages in chronic cardiac allograft rejection in vivo.Methods and Results\u2014 We have employed a rat heterotopic working-heart CR model for a magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Twenty-one allograft (PVG.1U\u2192PVG.R8) and 9 isograft (PVG.R8\u2192PVG.R8) transplantations were performed. Recipient macrophages are labeled via intravenous injection of micron-sized paramagnetic iron oxide particles (0.9 \u03bcm in diameter) at a dose of 4.5 mg Fe per rat 1 day before transplantation. Serial in vivo magnetic resonance images were acquired for up to 16 weeks \u2026",
                "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations after asphyxial cardiac arrest (CA) are not defined in developmental animal models or humans. We characterized regional and temporal changes in CBF from 5 to 150 mins after asphyxial CA of increasing duration (8.5, 9, 12 min) in postnatal day (PND) 17 rats using the noninvasive method of arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI). We also assessed blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and evaluated the relationship between CBF and mean arterial pressure after resuscitation. After all durations of asphyxia CBF alterations were region dependent. After 8.5- and 9-min asphyxia, intense subcortical hyperemia at 5 min was followed by return of CBF to baseline values by 10 mins. After 12-min asphyxia, hyperemia was absent and hypoperfusion reached a nadir of 38% to 65% of baselines with the lowest values in the cortex. BBB was impermeable to \u2026"
