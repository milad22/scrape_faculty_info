                "Cherry Murray Cherry Murray Professor of Physics Director, Biosphere2 Institute 520-621-6820 cherrymurray@email.arizona.edu Short bio  Cherry A Murray.pdf CV Cherry A Murray.pdf Education: PhD, 1978, Massachussets Institute of Technology Experimental Condensed Matter Physics After attaining my PhD in 1978, I immediately joined Bell Labs as a Member of Technical staff in the Physical Research Division.\u00a0 There my research interests were in fundamental experimental condensed matter and surface physics and subsequently nanotechnology and soft matter physics; after the telecommunications economic bubble burst in 2001, I was promoted to Senior Vice President, and quit my own laboratory research and switched to the management of semiconductor device physics, opto-mechanical telecommunications device R&D and R&D of wireless and optical telecommunication networks in support of Lucent Technologies\u2019 business units, and led the spinning off of unused technologies\u00a0 to start-up or other enterprises. After leaving Bell Labs in 2004, I focused on the strategy for and management of national security research as Deputy Director and Principal Associate Director at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; and after coming to Harvard as dean in 2009, on policy relevant to national security and energy, and the standing up of a new engineering school, emphasizing a design curriculum. Because of my extracurricular activities including my stint as Director of Science at the US Department of Energy I have become more interested in energy and environmental policy, the engagement of citizens and government in science and science policy, entrepreneurship and international development.\u00a0 My current interests are in transdiciplinary science and engineering education; furthering diversity in the science community and citizen engagement with science; and the sustainable development of communities in the developing world, with an emphasis on providing entrepreneurial and scalable solutions in food, water and energy and for all the UN Sustainable Development Goals. I do not intend to set up my own research lab in physics, but I expect to promote interest across campus and jointly write proposals to further interdisciplinary research and spin-off companies in the broad field of sustainable development.
