                "A model is proposed that relates the amount and equivocality of information processing to the variety and analyzability of work-unit activities. New questionnaire scales were developed for the information and task variables, and an exploratory test of the model was conducted on 24 work units. The reported amount of information processing increased with both task variety and analyzability; the reported use of equivocal information decreased with task analyzability. The findings suggest a modification of the previously reported positive relationship between task uncertainty and amount of information processing",
                "Management accounting and control deals with administrative devices which organizations use to control their managers and employees. Management accounting systems are a very important part used to motivate, monitor, measure, and sanction, the actions of managers and employees in organizations. Management Accounting and Control Systems 2nd Edition is about the design and working of management accounting and control from an organizational and sociological perspective. It focuses on how control systems are used to influence, motivate, and control what people do in organizations. The second edition of the book takes into account the need for a general update of the content and a change in the structure of the original text, and some of the comments received by the external reviewers",
                "This article proposes Giddens' structuration theory as a valuable framework for management accounting research to expand its domain beyond a technical focus to include social and political phenomena; it describes the theory, discusses its limitations, and presents an analysis of a longitudinal case study. The authors conclude that structuration theory is a more focused, informative, integrative, yet efficient, way to analyse how accounting systems are implicated in the construction, maintenance, and changes of the social order of an organization, than many frameworks used in previous studies. This article also speculates that Giddens' structuration theory with its key concepts of \u201cstructuration\u201d and the \u201cduality of structure\u201d can be read along with Foucault's \u201cpower\/knowledge\u201d and Derrida's \u201cdeconstruction\u201d as a post-modern genre for critical accounting research.",
                "Research on international marketing effectiveness was done by interviewing 34 senior executives in U.S. and Canadian firms, mainly in the electronics, machinery, and autoparts industry sectors. The study concentrated on small\u2013 and medium-sized firms. The findings indicate the relative importance of an information and control reporting system, organization of the international division, involvement of top management, R & D, technology, competitive pricing policy, marketing mix, and production function variables for international marketing effectiveness.",
                "This paper draws on two independent strands of literature \u2014 Baudrillard's orders-of-simulacra theoretic and financial accounting theory \u2014 to investigate the ontological status of information in accounting reports. It draws on Baudrillard's concepts of simulacra, hyperreality and implosion to trace the historical transformations of the accounting signs of income and capital from Sumerian times to the present. It posits that accounting today no longer refers to any objective reality but instead circulates in a \u201chyperreality\u201d of self-referential models. The paper then examines this conclusion from the viewpoint of recent clean surplus model research and argues that the distinction between income and capital is arbitrary and irrelevant provided the measurement process satisfies the clean surplus relation. Although accounting is arbitrary and hyperreal, it does impart a sense of exogeniety and predictability, particularly through the \u2026",
                "From the Publisher:A unique sociological view of accounting and information systems--their structure, purposes, and impact on business and the organization. Offers a range of perspectives, including human-relations, social-psychology, role relations, expert judgment, cognitive structures, personality traits, organizational sociology, and organization theory. Outlines a general model of the influence of technology on the characteristics and use of information systems. Special technology-based models of management control systems suggest a link between work-unit technology and information systems.",
                "Behavioral accounting research suggests that (1) the design and use of a management accounting system is related to overall characteristics of the organization, and (2) a management accounting system is one element in a package of control systems. The research reported here investigated the relationship between the organizational characteristic of departmental interdependence and the design and use of three elements in a package of management controls \u2014 the operating budget, periodic statistical reports, and standard operating policies and procedures. The findings support the hypothesis that departmental interdependence is related to the emphasis placed on each management control system. Standard operating procedures were an important control device when interdependence was low. The budget and statistical reports were used more extensively when interdependence was modurate. When \u2026",
                "In this paper we argue that ethnographic or interpretive accounting research studies (EARS), which have been marginalized by critical accounting theory studies (CATS) and rational accounting theory studies (RATS), are a valuable way to understand the way accounting works in actual organizational settings. The problem of researching trust and its relation to accounting is used as an example where EARS seems to hold the edge over both CATS and RATS. The paper describes three main types of EARS\u2014cognitive anthropology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology, briefly describes a classical ethnographic study and an accounting example of each type. It then sets up a conversational debate between EARS, CATS, and RATS in order to bring out their major points of disagreement and concurrence. The paper concludes by speculating that some sort of rapprochment might be worked out whereby \u2026",
                "Management control research from organization theory, accounting, and business policy is reviewed; and a two-stage qualitative study of management control systems (MCSs) used in business organizations is reported. The study identified four MCS components used at the middle management level: budget, policies and procedures, performance appraisal system, and statistical reports. Each MCS component played a role during the control cycle of target setting, monitoring, and corrective feedback. The findings were used to propose two models: One model links the MCS to business level strategy implementation, and the other defines primary and secondary roles for MCS components in the management control process.",
                "In the business world, recent years have seen a growing acknowledgement of the value of intangible assets rather than physical assets. This has precipitated a crisis in the accounting industry: the accounting representations relied upon for years can no longer be taken for granted. Here, Norman Macintosh argues that we now need to understand accounting in a different manner. Offering several different ways of looking at accounting and accountants, he draws upon the work of eminent thinkers such as Barthes, Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard and Bahktin. In doing this, he develops revolutionary insights into the nature of accounting, pioneering the introduction of contemporary poststructuralist ideas into accounting theory and practice. With a wide range of examples and case studies, this revolutionary new work will be essential reading for academic and professional accountants along with all those with an interest in the future of accounting."

Earlier Ph. D. Students (who have received their Ph.D. theses) during the period 2003- 2009 1. Dr. Ralph H. Scheicher Dr. Scheicher finished his Ph.D. thesis under my supervision in May 2004 in the fields of Muon and Muonium interactions in biological systems (DNA and Cytochrome C) and Muon catalyzed fusion involving solid triton and deuteron molecular ions which had a negative Muon taking part in their bonding. After receiving his Ph.D. degree, Dr. Scheicher went to the Condensed Matter Physics Theory Group at\u00a0Uppsala University,\u00a0Sweden\u00a0as a Post Doctoral Fellow for the year 2004-2005, and then joined the Physics Department at\u00a0Michigan\u00a0Technological\u00a0University,\u00a0Houghton,\u00a0Michigan\u00a0as a Visiting Assistant Professor for two years, 2005-2007. He is now, since 2007, a Research Scientist in the Condensed Matter Physics Theory group at\u00a0Uppsala University,\u00a0Sweden. During his career here as a Ph.D. student 2000-2004 and later work with my group he had a number of publications in condensed matter physics and biophysics including muon and muonium interactions in condensed matter and biological systems. His publications during his career as a Ph.D. student in my group and later work with my group are given below in the same notations as for Mr. Badu and Mr. Pink (my current students) as Pub # and Conf # from my Publication list and Conference Presentations list.

Exceptional Achievements by Dr. Scheicher after his graduate career I will be remarking about Dr. Scheicher`s many publications in a number of current fields besides the ones with my group after he finished his Ph.D. thesis, when I talk about his unusually strong research profile in remarking on the exceptional achievements by some of my past students. Additionally, Dr. Scheicher is a member of the Advisory Board for my Book Series. He is the youngest member, but he has been very valuable for in depth discussions about Books to choose for the Series that would be most valuable for current research developments in Materials Science, NanoScience and Biophysics. He has also provided valuable assistance in the choices of authors for Books in various Fields. 2. Dr. Junho Jeong Dr. Jeong finished his Ph.D. thesis under my supervision in May 2004 in the field of Muonium interactions in Organic ferromagnets and in the study of location of Er3+\u00a0in silicon as well as\u00a069Ga and\u00a014N nuclear quadrupole interactions in GaN. He is now on the faculty of a leading University in\u00a0South Korea,University\u00a0of\u00a0Uhlsan, (the headquarters for manufacture of Hyundai motor vehicles). He is active in research in Materials Science but I have not been able to be in close contact with him to say much about his current research interests. Regarding his Publications based on his Ph.D. thesis work and Conference Presentations about his research work, I will list his papers and presentation in the same way as I have done for the other three of my Ph.D. students based on my own publication and conference presentation lists. Publications Pub # 2, 3, 5, 13, 14, 16 [Six in total] International Conference Presentations Conf #s 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17 [Eight in all] APS March Meetings Conf #s 17, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 [Twenty four in all] 7.\u00a0\u00a0Recent Outstanding Achievements of Past Ph.D. students 1. Professor Bhanu Pratap Das:  Professor in\u00a0Institute\u00a0of\u00a0Astrophysics\u00a0inBangalore,\u00a0India: Professor B.P. Das did his Ph.D. thesis with me in early 1980\u2019s. His Ph.D. thesis was based on understanding of many-body effects on properties of heavy atoms using first principles relativistic Hartree-Fock theory combined with many-body perturbation theory. He studied magnetic hyperfine interactions in atomic systems and forbidden optical transitions that result from charge and parity violation effects in particle physics. He had worked on thallium and used the strength of the forbidden transitions to make accurate conclusions about the strength of fundamental interactions leading to charge and parity violation effects. He has recently predicted electric dipole moments by relativistic many-body theory (involving a procedure somewhat different than what he used for his Ph.D. thesis work) and compared it with it recent measurements for mercury atom. This work has been published in Phys. Rev. Letters, a very prestigious journal of American Physical Society, the same one where he had published his Ph.D. thesis work on Thallium. The recent experimental work and his theoretical work are receiving much attention in the scientific communities in both atomic physics and fundamental particle physics theory. 2. Professor Ranjit Pati: Associate Professor in\u00a0Michigan\u00a0Technological (Michigan\u00a0Tech) University. He received his Ph.D. degree under my supervision in 1997, working on electronic structure and hyperfine interactions (especially nuclear quadrupole interactions) in molecules involved in drugs and explosives and also on surface adsorbed atoms in semiconductors. He has become one of the leading experts in the theory of molecular electronics, especially the molecule- metal terminals. His work has been published in a number of leading journals including Physical Review Letters. His latest work about nine months back on metal-molecule junctions has received wide attention in news publications of recent breakthroughs in materials research. He has a sizable research group in his field at Michigan Tech and has an NSF Career Award Support for his research for the next five years. He is also a member of my Advisory Board for the Elsevier Book Series that I edit and gives me very valuable advice. 3. Dr. Ralph H. Scheicher: Research Scientist in Condensed Matter Theory in\u00a0Uppsala University,\u00a0Sweden. I have already described his Ph.D. thesis work and continuing active collaboration with my research group and his own substantial research work since leaving SUNY Albany after receiving his Ph.D. thesis degree which extends over many areas of materials science, nanoscience and biophysics. These fields involve interaction between DNA and carbon nanotubes, DNA sequencing using DNA-carbon nanotube interaction, storage of hydrogen (in the field of alternate energy resources) in porous materials and in light-metal hydride systems, metal-insulator transitions and superconducting behavior under pressure in hydrogen-rich materials. He is very widely sought after for international collaborations in many countries, including\u00a0China,\u00a0Malaysia,\u00a0South Korea,\u00a0Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0United States. For someone who has received his Ph.D. degree only five years back, the unusually large volume of publications in leading physics journals and interacting so actively with so many leading international groups is truly unusual and a source of great pride for our University and Department. 4. Professor Purusottam Jena :\u00a0\u00a0Distinguished Professor of Physics inVirginia\u00a0Commonwealth\u00a0University\u00a0in\u00a0Richmond,\u00a0Virginia. He received his Ph.D. thesis under my supervision from\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0California,\u00a0Riversidein 1970. His work involved study of band structures of metallic systems to understand electronic wave-function dependent properties. He continued on with metallic systems after his Ph.D. work, getting involved in the nature of hydrogen as impurity in metals and also moved on to do pioneering work on structures of metal, and hydrogen atom clusters, a field in which he is a leading authority. He then used his expertise in the two fields to study hydrogen storage in metals and then moved on to lighter systems than metals such as magnesium hydride compounds. He has become a well-known authority on hydrogen storage for use as an alternate energy resource In the year 2007-2008 he was appointed as a Jefferson Fellow, a very prestigious position in the US State Department, for providing advice on scientific matters and international scientific interactions. He was the Scientific Advisor for a large International Conference on Alternate Energy Resources organized by the State Department in 2008. He has returned to his Distinguished Professor position at his University but continues to advise the State Department on energy matters and is often designated to attend important International Conferences on Alternate Energy Resources. He is also on the Advisory Board for my Book Series, and is Volume Editor for a Book on \u201cClusters-Bridge across Disciplines\u201d which is expected to be published soon. Professor Jena\u2019s recognition as a leading scientist in a number of current fields of research and application interest, and recognition by the Federal Government as a Scientist to seek advice from, is a matter of great pride. He was a post-doctoral scientist in the Physics Department at SUNY Albany for the year 1970-71 immediately after completion of his Ph.D. degree in 1970, one year before I joined the Faculty here."
