                "The interplay of quantum anomalies with magnetic field and vorticity results in a variety of novel non-dissipative transport phenomena in systems with chiral fermions, including the quark\u2013gluon plasma. Among them is the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)\u2014the generation of electric current along an external magnetic field induced by chirality imbalance. Because the chirality imbalance is related to the global topology of gauge fields, the CME current is topologically protected and hence non-dissipative even in the presence of strong interactions. As a result, the CME and related quantum phenomena affect the hydrodynamical and transport behavior of strongly coupled quark\u2013gluon plasma, and can be studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions where strong magnetic fields are created by the colliding ions. Evidence for the CME and related phenomena has been reported by the STAR Collaboration at Relativistic Heavy Ion \u2026",
                "The chiral magnetic wave is a gapless collective excitation of quark-gluon plasma in the presence of an external magnetic field that stems from the interplay of chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects; it is composed of the waves of the electric and chiral charge densities coupled by the axial anomaly. We consider a chiral magnetic wave at finite baryon density and find that it induces the electric quadrupole moment of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions: the \u201cpoles\u201d of the produced fireball (pointing outside of the reaction plane) acquire additional positive electric charge, and the \u201cequator\u201d acquires additional negative charge. We point out that this electric quadrupole deformation lifts the degeneracy between the elliptic flows of positive and negative pions leading to v 2 (\u03c0+)< v 2 (\u03c0\u2212), and estimate the magnitude of the effect.",
                "A number of theoretical and lattice results lead us to believe that quark-gluon plasma not too far from T c contains not only electrically charged quasiparticles\u2014quarks and gluons\u2014but magnetically charged ones\u2014monopoles and dyons\u2014as well. Although binary systems such as charge-monopole and charge-dyon were considered in detail before in both classical and quantum settings, this is the first study of coexisting electric and magnetic particles in a many-body context. We perform a molecular dynamics study of strongly coupled plasmas with\u223c 1000 particles and differing fractions of magnetic charge. Correlation functions and Kubo formulas lead to transport properties such as the diffusion constant, the shear viscosity, and electric conductivity: We compare the first two with empirical data from RHIC experiments as well as with results from anti-de-Sitter space\/conformal field theory correspondence. We also \u2026",
                "In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, the matter formed shortly after the collision is a dense, out of equilibrium, system of gluons characterized by a semi-hard momentum scale Q s. Simple power counting arguments indicate that this system is over-occupied: the gluon occupation number is parametrically large when compared to a system in thermal equilibrium with the same energy density. On short time scales, soft elastic scattering tends to drive the system toward the formation of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate that contains a large fraction of the gluons while contributing little to the energy density. The lifetime and existence of this condensate depends on whether inelastic processes, that occur on the same time scale as elastic processes, preferably increase or decrease the number of gluons. During this overpopulated stage, and all the way to thermalization, the system behaves as a strongly interacting fluid, even \u2026",
                "A new model (CUJET3. 0) of jet quenching in nuclear collisions coupled to bulk data constrained (VISH2+ 1D) viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds is constructed by generalizing the perturbative QCD based (CUJET2. 0) model to include two complementary non-perturbative chromodynamical features of the QCD con_nement cross-over phase transition near Tc\u2248 160 MeV:(1) the suppression of quark and gluon chromo-electric-charged (cec) degrees of freedom and (2) the emergence of chromo-magnetic-monopole (cmm) degrees of freedom. Such a semi Quark Gluon Monopole Plasma (sQGMP) microscopic scenario is tested by comparing predictions of the leading hadron nuclear modification factors, R AA h (pT> 10GeV= c;), and their azimuthal elliptic asymmetry v 2 h (pT> 10GeV= c;) with available data on h= \u03c0, D; B jet fragments from nuclear collisions at RHIC ( ATeV) and LHC ( ATeV). The cmm degrees of \u2026",
                "The heavy-ion collisions can produce extremely strong transient magnetic and electric fields. We study the azimuthal fluctuation of these fields and their correlations with the also fluctuating matter geometry (characterized by the participant plane harmonics) using event-by-event simulations. A sizable suppression of the angular correlations between the magnetic field and the 2nd and 4th harmonic participant planes is found in very central and very peripheral collisions, while the magnitudes of these correlations peak around impact parameter b\u223c 8\u201310 fm for RHIC collisions. This can lead to notable impacts on a number of observables related to various magnetic field induced effects, and our finding suggests that the optimal event class for measuring them should be that corresponding to b\u223c 8\u201310 fm.",
                "We analytically calculate the contribution of transverse momentum conservation to the azimuthal correlations that have been proposed as signals for possible local strong parity violation and recently have been measured in heavy ion collisions. These corrections are on the order of the inverse of the total final-state particle multiplicity and, thus, are on the same order as the observed signal. The corrections contribute with the same sign to both like-sign and opposite-sign pair correlations. Their dependence on the momentum is in qualitative agreement with the measurements by the solenoidal tracker at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider Collaboration, while the pseudorapidity dependence differs from the data.",
                "We study dependence of jet quenching on matter density, using \u201ctomography\u201d of the fireball provided by RHIC data on azimuthal anisotropy v 2 of high p t hadron yield at different centralities. Slicing the fireball into shells with constant (entropy) density, we derive a \u201clayer-wise geometrical limit\u201d v 2 max\ufeff which is indeed above the data v 2< v 2 max\ufeff. Interestingly, the limit is reached only if quenching is dominated by shells with the entropy density exactly in the near-T c region. We show two models that simultaneously describe the high p t v 2 and R A\u2212 A data and conclude that such a description can be achieved only if the jet quenching is few times stronger in the near-T c region relative to QGP at T> T c. One possible reason for such enhancement may be recent indications that the near-T c region is a magnetic plasma of relatively light color-magnetic monopoles.",
                "The magnetic scenario for strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) emphasizes the role of monopoles near or above the deconfinement temperature, and specifically predicts that they help reduce its viscosity by the \u201cmagnetic bottle\u201d effect. Here we present results for monopole-(anti) monopole correlation functions from our classical molecular dynamics simulations, which are in good agreement with the lattice results. By analysis of the correlation functions, we show that the magnetic Coulomb coupling runs in the direction opposite to the electric one. However, as T decreases to T c, the magnetic coupling never gets too weak, with the plasma parameter always large enough (\u0393> 1). This nicely agrees with empirical evidence from the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider experiments, implying that magnetic objects should also form a good liquid with low viscosity.",
                "We study the rotational collective motion of the quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using the widely adopted a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. The global angular momentum, the average vorticity carried by the quark-gluon plasma, and the locally defined vorticity fields are computed for Au+ Au collisions, with detailed information of their time evolution, spatial distribution, as well as the dependence on beam energy and collision centrality."
