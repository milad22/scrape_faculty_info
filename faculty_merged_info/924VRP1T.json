                "Lafora's disease (LD; OMIM 254780) is an autosomal recessive form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized by seizures and cumulative neurological deterioration. Onset occurs during late childhood and usually results in death within ten years of the first symptoms 1, 2. With few exceptions, patients follow a homogeneous clinical course despite the existence of genetic heterogeneity 3. Biopsy of various tissues, including brain, revealed characteristic polyglucosan inclusions called Lafora bodies 4\u20138, which suggested LD might be a generalized storage disease 6, 9. Using a positional cloning approach, we have identified at chromosome 6q24 a novel gene, EPM2A, that encodes a protein with consensus amino acid sequence indicative of a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). mRNA transcripts representing alternatively spliced forms of EPM2A were found in every tissue examined, including brain.

                "Objective:  To assess the prevalence, nature, and associated phenotypes of ATP13A2 gene mutations among patients with juvenile parkinsonism (onset <21 years) or young onset (between 21 and 40 years) Parkinson disease (YOPD).Methods:  We studied 46 patients, mostly from Italy or Brazil, including 11 with juvenile parkinsonism and 35 with YOPD. Thirty-three cases were sporadic and 13 had positive family history compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Forty-two had only parkinsonian signs, while four (all juvenile-onset) had multisystemic involvement. The whole ATP13A2 coding region (29 exons) and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced from genomic DNA.Results:  A novel homozygous missense mutation (Gly504Arg) was identified in one sporadic case from Brazil with juvenile parkinsonism. This patient had symptoms onset at age 12, levodopa-responsive severe akinetic-rigid \u2026",
                "Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood.To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the molecular diagnosis of SCA.We have (1) assessed repeat sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was \u2026",
                "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are rare genetic diseases caused by the deficiency of one of the lysosomal enzymes involved in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) breakdown pathway. This metabolic block leads to the accumulation of GAG in various organs and tissues of the affected patients, resulting in a multisystemic clinical picture, sometimes including cognitive impairment. Until the beginning of the XXI century, treatment was mainly supportive. Bone marrow transplantation improved the natural course of the disease in some types of MPS, but the morbidity and mortality restricted its use to selected cases. The identification of the genes involved, the new molecular biology tools and the availability of animal models made it possible to develop specific enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) for these diseases. At present, a great number of Brazilian medical centers from all regions of the country have experience with ERT for MPS I, II, and VI, acquired not only through patient treatment but also in clinical trials. Taking the three types of MPS together, over 200 patients have been treated with ERT in our country. This document summarizes the experience of the professionals involved, along with the data available in the international literature, bringing together and harmonizing the information available on the management of these severe and progressive diseases, thus disclosing new prospects for Brazilian patients affected by these conditions.",
                "Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar degeneration caused by an expanded CAG repeat on chromosome 14q32.1, is a heterogeneous disorder for clinical manifestations. The reasons for the wide range of neurologic findings in this disease are poorly understood.To explain part of this heterogeneity through the association of the neurologic findings with sex, disease duration, age of onset, clinical type, and size of CAG repeat expansion.A case-control study.Ambulatory care.A consecutive sample of 62 patients with MJD.Neurologic signs.A direct relationship was found between the disease duration and severity of gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia (P<.02). The most severe forms of nuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 1 MJD \u2026",
                "In mucopolysaccharidosis I, deficiency of \u03b1\u2010L\u2010iduronidase can cause spinal cord compression (SCC) due to storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within the cervical meninges. As intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is not likely to provide enzyme across the blood\u2013brain barrier, standard treatment for this complication is usually surgical, which has a high morbidity and mortality risk. We report on the use of intrathecal (IT) laronidase in a MPS I patient with SCC who refused the surgical treatment. Assessments were performed at baseline, with clinical and biochemical evaluations, 4\u2010extremity somatosensory evoked potentials, 12 min walk test and MRI studies of the CNS. Changes on these parameters were evaluated after 4 IT infusions of laronidase administered monthly via lumbar puncture. To our knowledge, this was the first MPS patient who received IT ERT. No major adverse events were \u2026",
                "We aimed to perform a comprehensive systematic review of the existing ataxia scales. We described the disorders for which the instruments have been validated and used, the time spent in its application, its validated psychometric properties, and their use in studies of natural history and clinical trials. A search from 1997 onwards was performed in the MEDLINE, LILACS, and Cochrane databases. The web sites ClinicalTrials.gov and Orpha.net were also used to identify the endpoints used in ongoing randomized clinical trials. We identified and described the semiquantitative ataxia scales (ICARS, SARA, MICARS, BARS); semiquantitative ataxia and non-ataxia scales (UMSARS, FARS, NESSCA); a semiquantitative non-ataxia scale (INAS); quantitative ataxia scales (CATSYS 2000, AFCS, CCFS and CCFSw, and SCAFI); and the self-performed ataxia scale (FAIS). SARA and ICARS were the best studied \u2026",
                " Background The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically heterogeneous group of debilitating, neurodegenerative diseases, related to fourteen different loci\u2013 SCAs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD\/SCA 3), and DRPLA. Objectives (1) to verify the frequency of SCA1, SCA2, MJD, DRPLA, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA8 in a series of new SCA patients from South Brazil and (2) to compare their molecular and clinical characteristics with other patients previously described. Methods sixty-six cases were included in the present study: 52 were familial and 14 sporadic. Molecular analysis of the trinucleotide repeat loci were performed according to methods in the literature. Results 92 % of families with autosomal dominant inheritance segregated the MJD1 mutation, 2 % of families segregated the SCA7 mutation and 6 % remained \u2026",
                "DNAJC6 mutations were recently described in two families with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (onset age\u2009<\u200911), prominent atypical signs, poor or absent response to levodopa, and rapid progression (wheelchair\u2010bound within \u223c10 years from onset). Here, for the first time, we report DNAJC6 mutations in early\u2010onset Parkinson's disease (PD).The DNAJC6 open reading frame was analyzed in 274 patients with early\u2010onset sporadic or familial PD. Selected variants were followed up by cosegregation, homozygosity mapping, linkage analysis, whole\u2010exome sequencing, and protein studies.We identified two families with different novel homozygous DNAJC6 mutations segregating with PD. In each family, the DNAJC6 mutation was flanked by long runs of homozygosity within highest linkage peaks. Exome sequencing did not detect additional pathogenic variants within the \u2026",
                " Summary: We report the clinical and radiological central nervous system (CNS) findings of 8 Fabry disease patients, before (8\/8) and after (7\/8) 12 months of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase-alpha. Eight biochemically proven Fabry disease patients (from four families) were included. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals during 12 months of ERT. Evaluations included a thorough, standardized neurological examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA). Brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was also performed in 5\/8 patients. The presence and location of grey- and white-matter lesions, the presence of vascular occlusion or ectasia on MRA and the metabolite ratios on MRS were determined, as well as their relation to age, symptoms and neurological examination.
