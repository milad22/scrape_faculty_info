Dr. LeClair is currently building up a shared laboratory for electrical, magnetic, and optical characterization of novel materials and devices down to ultra-low temperatures (<400mK) and high magnetic fields (>7T). He is the author of over 25 publications\u00a0and co-author of two patents. Dr. LeClair received his PhD in physics (cum laude) from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands in 2002. From 2002-2005, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory. He joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at The University of Alabama in 2005."
