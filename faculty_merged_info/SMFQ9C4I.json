                "This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark, CKM quark-mixing matrix, V ud & V us , V cb & V ub , fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles, cosmological \u2026",

                "We demonstrate a new source for flavor-changing neutral currents within the minimal supersymmetric standard model. At moderate to large tan \u03b2, it is no longer possible to diagonalize the masses of the quarks in the same basis as their Yukawa couplings. This generates flavor-violating couplings of the form b R d L \u03c6 and b R s L \u03c6 where \u03c6 is any of the three neutral, physical Higgs bosons. These new couplings lead to rare processes in the B system such as B 0\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and B 0\u2212 B 0 mixing. We show that the latter are anomalously suppressed, while the former is in the experimentally interesting range, with an observable signal possible at Run II of the Tevatron if m A\u2272 400\u2013700 GeV.",
