                "We demonstrate a new source for flavor-changing neutral currents within the minimal supersymmetric standard model. At moderate to large tan \u03b2, it is no longer possible to diagonalize the masses of the quarks in the same basis as their Yukawa couplings. This generates flavor-violating couplings of the form b R d L \u03c6 and b R s L \u03c6 where \u03c6 is any of the three neutral, physical Higgs bosons. These new couplings lead to rare processes in the B system such as B 0\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and B 0\u2212 B 0 mixing. We show that the latter are anomalously suppressed, while the former is in the experimentally interesting range, with an observable signal possible at Run II of the Tevatron if m A\u2272 400\u2013700 GeV.",

                "Christopher Kolda Christopher Kolda Professor,\u00a0Theoretical High Energy Physics Director, Glynn Family Honors Program B.A., Johns Hopkins University, 1990 M.S., University of Michigan, 1992 Ph.D., ibid., 1995 E-mail: ckolda@nd.edu Home Page: http:\/\/www.nd.edu\/~ckolda Address: 322 Nieuwland Science Hall Office Phone: (574) 631-6823 The Standard Model of particle physics has been a successful explanation for the fundamental laws of physics at the subatomic level, up to and including the discovery of the Higgs boson, at least when augmented by some yet unknown source of neutrino mass. But the model\u2019s shortcomings are evident at both the small and large scales. At small scales, the presence of a fundamental scalar field in the Standard Model causes the theory to be plagued by fine tunings whenever it is embedded in a more complete theory. And given the inability of quantum field theory to describe gravity, such an embedding, whether it be string\/M-theory or something else, seems inevitable. Ideas like supersymmetry are still the best theoretical option for solving these problems, though experimental evidence for this idea has been in short supply. At large scales, the Standard Model successfully describes a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, but fails to explain the source of the universe\u2019s dark matter or dark energy. The dark matter, in particular, seems likely to be a new elementary particle, though other options have been raised. Particle dark matter provides a rare opportunity: a discovery in direct direction experiments and production in high-energy colliders such as the LHC. But dark matter is not the only cosmological mystery: baryogenesis, the source of the universe\u2019s inflationary epoch, and even inconsistencies in recent and early universe derivations of the Hubble constant all beg for particle physics explanations. It is at this interface between collider physics and cosmology that my work mainly falls. \u201cStudy of Constrained Supersymmetry,\u201d G. Kane, C. Kolda, L. Roszkowski and J. Wells, Phys. Rev.
