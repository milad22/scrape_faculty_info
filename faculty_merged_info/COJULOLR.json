                "Illicit drug consumption in five cities in South Korea was estimated by analyzing 17 drug residues in untreated wastewater samples collected during the Christmas and New Year period of 2012-13. Only methamphetamine, amphetamine, and codeine were detected at concentrations of tens of nanograms per liter or even lower concentrations in more than 90% of the samples. Other illicit drug residues (including cocaine, methadone, and benzoylecgonine) that have been detected frequently in wastewater from other countries were not found in this study. Methamphetamine was found to be the most widely used illicit drug in South Korea, and the estimated average consumption rate was 22 mg d\u22121 (1000 people)\u22121. This rate is, for example, 2-5 times lower than the estimated average consumption rates in Hong Kong and other parts of China and 4-80 times lower than the estimated average consumption rates in cities \u2026",
                "This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of 33 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), five artificial sweeteners (ASs), and six pesticides in groundwater in rural agricultural and rural non-agricultural area in South Korea. A total of 31 target compounds (15 antibiotics, four anthelmintics, seven other PPCPs, four ASs, and one pesticide) were detected in agricultural groundwater at concentrations from not detected (ND) to 49.3\u202fng\/L for PPCPs, ND to 1340\u202fng\/L for ASs, and ND to 116\u202fng\/L for pesticides. Four target compounds (two PPCPs and two ASs) were detected in rural non-agricultural groundwater in the range of 0.085\u20135.74\u202fng\/L for PPCPs and 5.64\u20131330\u202fng\/L for ASs. Among the target compounds, ASs, especially acesulfame (detection frequency 69% in rural agricultural areas and 100% in the rural non-agricultural area) were predominantly detected in both agricultural (mean \u2026",
                "Seasonal variations in the concentrations of eight ultraviolet (UV) filters and 22 illicit drugs including their metabolites in the Korean aquatic environment were investigated. Seawater samples from three beaches, water samples from two rivers, and influents and effluents from three wastewater treatment plants were analyzed. The UV filter concentrations in the seawater, river water, and effluent samples were 39.4\u2013296, 35.4\u2013117, and 6.84\u201351.1 ng L-1, respectively. The total UV filter concentrations in the seawater samples were 1.9\u20134.4 times higher at the peak of the holiday season than outside the peak holiday season. An environmental risk assessment showed that ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) could cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms in the seawater at the three beaches during the holiday period. Seven of the 22 target illicit drugs including their metabolites were detected in the wastewater \u2026",
                "In this study, the occurrence and temporal variation of eight pharmaceuticals comprising antibiotics (clarithromycin, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim), scabicide (carbamazepine) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (acetylsalicylic acid, naproxen) in main stream and its tributary of the Nakdong River basin, were investigated. Concentrations of the target compounds ranged from . The highest average concentration was observed for clarithromycin (), followed by sulfamethazine (), sulfamethoxazole (), naproxen (), carbamazepine (), acetylsalicylic acid (), sulfathiazole () and trimethoprim (). The decreasing pattern of pharmaceutical concentrations was observed along with Nakdong River and the higher concentrations in downstream were observed than those in upstream. There was no temporal variation of the target compounds although the highest level was found in February. The calculated hazard quotients (HQs) for eight pharmaceuticals were below 1, indicating no environmental hazard in Nakdong River. However, further monitoring is still needed due to the other pharmaceuticals widely used in Korea.",
                "Drug abuse trends in South Korea were assessed by estimating the consumption rates of drugs that may be abused or misused by performing wastewater-based drug epidemiology. Of the 29 target compounds, 10 were found in samples from three wastewater treatment plants. Ephedrine had the highest mean estimated consumption rate, 574.1\u202fmg\u202fd\u22121 (1000 people)\u22121. The anti-obesity drugs phendimetrazine and phentermine had the second and fifth highest mean estimated consumption rates, 182.9 and 113.1\u202fmg\u202fd\u22121 (1000 people)\u22121, respectively. The zolpidem consumption rate was 65.8\u202fmg\u202fd\u22121 (1000 people)\u22121. Methamphetamine was the only illicit drug detected in wastewater, and the estimated consumption rates (14.9\u201328.6\u202fmg\u202fd\u22121 (1000 people)\u22121) were similar to consumption rates found in previous Korean studies (not detected to 45.8\u202fmg\u202fd\u22121 (1000 people)\u22121). The mean estimated \u2026",
                "The concentrations of 14 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and 46 pharmaceuticals in raw water and drinking water from five drinking water treatment plants were determined to assess removal of the chemicals during treatment. 10 out of 14 PFASs were detected in the raw and drinking water samples. The mean perfluorohexane sulfonate concentrations in raw and drinking water were the highest with levels of 106 and 69.6 ng L\u22121, respectively and the other PFAS concentrations were lower. The \u221114PFAS and individual PFAS removal efficiencies for the treatment plants were \u221236.9% to 70.7% (mean 31.3%) but the granular activated carbon process removed >80% of the total amount of long-chain PFASs that was removed. The removal efficiency increased as the perfluorocarbon chain length increased. The removal efficiencies increased by 14.2% and 11.2% from the shortest to the longest perfluoroalkyl \u2026",
                "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations of groundwater in three cities of the Nakdong River Basin in South Korea were quantified to investigate PFAS contamination and the effect of PFAS leakage incident that occurred in the study area in 2018. Groundwater PFASs concentration ranged from non-detectable (N.D.) to 36.9 ng\/L (mean 14.1 ng\/L), in which, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were commonly observed. Compared to long-chain (C \u2265 8) PFAS, short-chain (<C8) PFAS are more commonly detected in groundwater. Statistical differences were found between the groundwater obtained from different land use. PFAS detected in groundwater from industrial land use were significant different (p<0.01) than other land usages. Spatial difference of PFAS concentrations and distributions in \u2026",
                "This study investigated the tissue distribution of phenanthrene (PHE) and the formation of monohydroxy-phenanthrene (OH-PHE) metabolites in Korean rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii). PHE was intragastrically administered to two groups of rockfish. The first group was exposed to PHE at a low dose (10 mg\/kg body weight) and the second group was exposed at a high dose (30 mg\/kg body weight). The rockfish were analyzed and the levels of PHE were higher in the liver, followed by muscle, and then bile. PHE concentrations in the liver, muscle, and bile were 1.4\u201326, 0.10\u20132.01, and not detected (ND)\u20130.13 \u03bcg\/g wet weight, respectively. All five monohydroxylated PHE metabolites (1-OH-PHE, 2-OH-PHE, 3-OH-PHE, 4-OH-PHE, and 9-OH-PHE) were detected only in bile. Among these OH-PHE metabolites, 3-OH-PHE was found at the highest concentration from all fish bile samples in both PHE exposure groups \u2026",
                "In this research, 16 US-EPA priority PAHs were analyzed to identify their concentrations and congener distribution profiles of various media in Busan. Samples were collected from the major terrestrial media: freshwater (18 points), soil (20 points), and pine needle (12 points). The levels of \u03a316PAHs in soil, water, and pine needle samples ranged from 0.027 to 2,071 \u00b5g\/kg dw (mean: 113.9 \u00b5g\/kg dw), 25.1 to 2,665 ng\/L (mean: 201 ng\/L), and 0.680 to 87.05 \u00b5g\/kg (mean: 9.981 \u00b5g\/kg), respectively. Different levels and patterns of PAHs were observed with the land use of sampling sites. PAH profiles were compared by principal component analysis (PCA) and diagnostic ratios to observe the influences of various pollution sources. Heavily contaminated sites were directly influenced by different pollution sources. For example, more contaminated soil samples had petrogenic PAHs mostly, whereas highly contaminated pine needle samples contained pyrogenic PAHs. This research could give useful basic data and appropriate analysis procedures of multimedia for probabilistic exposure assessment of organic pollutants in Korea."
