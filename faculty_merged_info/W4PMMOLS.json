                "Although much is known about the natural history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the development of SLE autoantibodies before the diagnosis of the disease has not been extensively explored. We investigated the onset and progression of autoantibody development before the clinical diagnosis.The Department of Defense Serum Repository contains approximately 30 million specimens prospectively collected from more than 5 million U.S. Armed Forces personnel. We evaluated serum samples obtained from 130 persons before they received a diagnosis of SLE, along with samples from matched controls.In 115 of the 130 patients with SLE (88 percent), at least one SLE autoantibody tested was present before the diagnosis (up to 9.4 years earlier; mean, 3.3 years). Antinuclear antibodies were present in 78 percent (at a dilution of 1:120 or more), anti\u2013double-stranded DNA \u2026",
                "To develop and validate an international set of classification criteria for primary Sj\u00f6gren9s syndrome (SS) using guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). These criteria were developed for use in individuals with signs and\/or symptoms suggestive of SS.We assigned preliminary importance weights to a consensus list of candidate criteria items, using multi-criteria decision analysis. We tested and adapted the resulting draft criteria using existing cohort data on primary SS cases and non-SS controls, with case\/non-case status derived from expert clinical judgement. We then validated the performance of the classification criteria in a separate cohort of patients.The final classification criteria are based on the weighted sum of five items: anti-SSA\/Ro antibody positivity and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus \u2026",
                "Western blotting (protein blotting or immunoblotting) is a powerful and important procedure for the immunodetection of proteins post-electrophoresis, particularly proteins that are of low abundance. Since the inception of the protocol for protein transfer from an electrophoresed gel to a membrane in 1979, protein blotting has evolved greatly. The scientific community is now confronted with a variety of ways and means to carry out this transfer. This review describes the various procedures that have been used to transfer proteins from a gel to a membrane based on the principles of simple diffusion, vacuum-assisted solvent flow and electrophoretic elution. Finally, a brief description of methods generally used to detect antigens on blots is also described.",
                "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is a common autoimmune disease (affecting\u223c 0.7% of European Americans) that typically presents as keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Here we report results of a large-scale association study of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In addition to strong association within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21 (P meta= 7.65\u00d7 10\u2212 114), we establish associations with IRF5-TNPO3 (P meta= 2.73\u00d7 10\u2212 19), STAT4 (P meta= 6.80\u00d7 10\u2212 15), IL12A (P meta= 1.17\u00d7 10\u2212 10), FAM167A-BLK (P meta= 4.97\u00d7 10\u2212 10), DDX6-CXCR5 (P meta= 1.10\u00d7 10\u2212 8) and TNIP1 (P meta= 3.30\u00d7 10\u2212 8). We also observed suggestive associations (P meta< 5\u00d7 10\u2212 5) with variants in 29 other regions, including TNFAIP3, PTTG1, PRDM1, DGKQ, FCGR2A, IRAK1BP1, ITSN2 and PHIP, among others. These results highlight the importance of genes that are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity in Sj\u00f6gren's \u2026",
                "Autoantibodies from many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus bind the Sm autoantigen B\/B' polypeptide. The binding of serial serum specimens to the 233 overlapping octapeptides of Sm B\/B' have shown that of the B\/B'-derived octapeptides, PPPGMRPP and PPPGIRGP are early targets of the autoimmune response in some lupus patients. Rabbits immunized with PPPGMRPP and PPPGIRGP develop antibodies which not only bind these octapeptides, but also subsequently bind many other octapeptides of Sm B\/B'. Eventually, the rabbits immunized with one octapeptide develop autoantibodies that bind other spliceosomal proteins including D, 70K, A, and C. Any mechanisms that operate to maintain tolerance or anergy for the spliceosome are thus overcome. Features considered typical of human systemic lupus erythematosus are also found in these peptide-immunized animals, such as antinuclear \u2026"
