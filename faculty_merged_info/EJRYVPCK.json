                "John F.C. Wardle John F.C. Wardle Professor of Astrophysics PhD, University of Manchester, England, 1969 John Wardle studies powerful extragalactic radio sources and especially the nuclei of quasars using the Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory . He specializes in making polarization observations of quasars to map the magnetic fields near the super-massive black holes at the heart of these objects. Recent results include the first detections of circular polarization at milli-arcsecond resolution. Professor Wardle is a member of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration .
