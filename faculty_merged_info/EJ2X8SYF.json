Research Interests Experimental Nuclear Physics & Low Energy Particle Physics. Presently I am using new technologies to trap free neutrons for use in symmetry tests of the electroweak standard model. In particular we are building an experiment to search for new sources of Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry violation in the form of a permanent electric dipole moment for the free neutron.
