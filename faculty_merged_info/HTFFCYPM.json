                "DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA\/Ag NCs) are an emerging set of fluorophores that are smaller than semiconductor quantum dots and can have better photostability and brightness than commonly used organic dyes. Here we find the red fluorescence of DNA\/Ag NCs can be enhanced 500-fold when placed in proximity to guanine-rich DNA sequences. On the basis of this new phenomenon, we have designed a DNA detection probe (NanoCluster Beacon, NCB) that \u201clights up\u201d upon target binding. Since NCBs do not rely on Fo\u0308rster energy transfer for quenching, they can easily reach high (>100) signal-to-background ratios (S\/B ratios) upon target binding. Here, in a separation-free assay, we demonstrate NCB detection of an influenza target with a S\/B ratio of 175, a factor of 5 better than a conventional molecular beacon probe. Since the observed fluorescence enhancement is caused by intrinsic \u2026",
                "Most aerobic bacteria secrete siderophores to facilitate iron acquisition. Two families of siderophores were isolated from strains belonging to two different genera of marine bacteria. The aquachelins, from Halomonas aquamarina strain DS40M3, and the marinobactins, from Marinobacter sp. strains DS40M6 and DS40M8, each contain a unique peptidic head group that coordinates iron(III) and an appendage of one of a series of fatty acid moieties. These siderophores have low critical micelle concentrations (CMCs). In the absence of iron, the marinobactins are present as micelles at concentrations exceeding their CMC; upon addition of iron(III), the micelles undergo a spontaneous phase change to form vesicles. These observations suggest that unique iron acquisition mechanisms may have evolved in marine bacteria.",

Martinez Professor Director, Center for Materials Interfaces in Research and Applications jennifer.martinez@nau.edu 928-523-4304 36-331 Jen\u2019s current research interests center on the development of fluorescent nano clusters, their physical characterization and their applications. Further, the Martinez group has been active in creating polymers through genetic engineering. Through combinatorial processes, they are creating systems to select for polymers that have defined function within days and not decades (for applications in both regenerative medicine and optoelectronics). Jen is privileged to have been honored as a AAAS and Kavli Fellow and has received the Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering (PECASE), Los Alamos Fellows Research Prize and an R&D 100 Award (the \u201cEmmy\u201d of patent development), and other fellowships and student mentorship awards.
