                "A golden age for heavy-quarkonium physics dawned a decade ago, initiated by the confluence of exciting advances in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and an explosion of related experimental activity. The early years of this period were chronicled in the Quarkonium Working Group (QWG) CERN Yellow Report (YR) in 2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that time and provided specific recommendations for further progress. However, the broad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles could only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII program concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the B-factories and CLEO-c flourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the Tevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the deconfinement regime. All these experiments leave \u2026",
                "We determine the recombination probabilities for gluons to go into gluons or into quarks in a low-density limit. A modified Altarelli-Parisi equation expressing this recombination is given. We find recombination is very small compared to normal evolution in all interesting circumstances except that of nuclear shadowing. Thus, for evolution above Q0 \u2248 2 GeV, the gluon density remains far below saturation except at unusually small values of x.",
                "The CTEQ program for the determination of parton distributions through a global QCD analysis of data for various hard scattering processes is fully described. A new set of distributions, CTEQ3, incorporating several new types of data is reported and compared to the two previous sets of CTEQ distributions. A comparison with current data is discussed in some detail. The remaining uncertainties in the parton distributions and methods to further reduce them are assessed. Comparisons with the results of other global analyses are also presented.",
                "This White Paper presents the science case of an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), focused on the structure and interactions of gluon-dominated matter, with the intent to articulate it to the broader nuclear science community. It was commissioned by the managements of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) with the objective of presenting a summary of scientific opportunities and goals of the EIC as a follow-up to the 2007 NSAC Long Range plan. This document is a culmination of a community-wide effort in nuclear science following a series of workshops on EIC physics over the past decades and, in particular, the focused ten-week program on \u201cGluons and quark sea at high energies\u201d at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Fall 2010. It contains a brief description of a few golden physics measurements along with accelerator and detector concepts required \u2026",
                "This paper describes salient features of new sets of parton distributions obtained by the CTEQ Collaboration based on a comprehensive QCD global analysis of all available data. The accuracy of the new data on deep inelastic scattering structure functions obtained by the very high statistics NMC and CCFR experiments provides unprecedented sensitivity to the flavor dependence of the sea-quark distributions. In addition to much better determination of the small-x dependence of all parton distributions, we found:(i) the strange quark distribution is much softer than the non-strange sea quarks and rises above the latter at small-x; and (ii) the difference d-u changes sign as a function of x. A few alternative sets of viable distributions with conventional assumptions are also discussed.",
                "Using generalized factorization theorems, we calculate the leading single transverse spin asymmetry for high transverse-momentum direct-photon production in pp collisions, in terms of partonic matrix elements. The leading contribution comes from a \u2018\u2018twist-3\u2019\u2019parton distribution, involving the correlation between quark fields and the gluonic field strength. With simple assumptions for this matrix element, the asymmetry increases with x F, naturally giving effects of 10% or more at large x F.",
                "We analyze single transverse-spin asymmetries for hadronic pion production at large transverse momenta using QCD factorization. In the large x F region, leading contributions to the asymmetries are naturally produced by twist-3 parton correlation functions that couple quark fields and gluon field strengths. With a simple model for these matrix elements, leading-order asymmetries calculated from QCD are consistent with data on pion production from Fermilab, and can be used to predict single-spin asymmetries at BNL RHIC. We argue that our perturbative calculation for the asymmetries is relevant to pion transverse momenta as low as a few GeV."
