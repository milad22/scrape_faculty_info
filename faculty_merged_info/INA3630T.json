                "Many marine fishes are cosmopolitan, occurring in continuous (e.g., circumtropical) or discontinuous (e.g., antitropical) distributions. Little is known of the genetic basis of population structure of these species, even though several support extensive fisheries. To develop a database that would facilitate comparison of the population structures among cosmopolitan fishes we consistently included restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a common approach to our investigations of these species. This article presents a review of those analyses. Considerable intra`specific genetic variation was revealed within all cosmopolitan marine species. Continuously distributed species displayed population structures ranging from a lack of significant heterogeneity between ocean samples to shallow but significant structuring within an ocean basin. In general, greater \u2026",

Bluefin tuna were sampled over a period of 5 years from the Balearic and Tyrrhenian seas in the western basin of the Mediterranean Sea, and from the southern Ionian Sea in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Analyses of multilocus microsatellite genotypes and mitochondrial control region sequences revealed no significant heterogeneity among collections taken from the same location in different years; however, significant spatial genetic heterogeneity was observed across all samples for both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control region sequences (FST = 0.0023, P = 0.038 and \u03a6ST = 0.0233, P = 0.000, respectively). Significant genetic \u2026",
                "Different classes of molecular markers occasionally yield discordant views of population structure within a species. Here, we examine the distribution of molecular variance from 14 polymorphic loci comprising four classes of molecular markers within \u2248 400 blue marlin individuals (Makaira nigricans). Samples were collected from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans over 5 years. Data from five hypervariable tetranucleotide microsatellite loci and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of whole molecule mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were reported and compared with previous analyses of allozyme and single\u2010copy nuclear DNA (scnDNA) loci. Temporal variance in allele frequencies was nonsignificant in nearly all cases. Mitochondrial and microsatellite loci revealed striking phylogeographic partitioning among Atlantic and Pacific Ocean samples. A large cluster of alleles was present almost exclusively \u2026",
                "The U.S. Atlantic coastal pelagic longline fishery that targets tunas and swordfish also interacts with a wide range of non-target species including billfishes and sea turtles. Preliminary studies indicate that a change in terminal gear from J-style hooks to circle hooks may reduce bycatch mortality, but the effects of this change on catch rates of target species are unclear. To evaluate this, we monitored catch composition, catch rates, hooking location, and number of fish alive at haulback during 85 sets in the fall and spring seasonal fisheries from a commercial vessel operating in the western North Atlantic. Circle (size 16\/0, 0\u00b0 offset) and J-style (size 9\/0, 10\u00b0 offset) hooks were deployed in an alternating fashion. Hook\u2013time recorders were used to assess time at hooking and temperature\u2013depth recorders to measure gear behavior. Catch rates for most species categories were not significantly different between hook types \u2026",
