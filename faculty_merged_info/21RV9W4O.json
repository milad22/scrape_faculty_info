                "Synthesis of nanocrystals with exposed high-energy facets is a well-known challenge in many fields of science and technology. The higher reactivity of these facets simultaneously makes them desirable catalysts for sluggish chemical reactions and leads to their small populations in an equilibrated crystal. Using anatase TiO2 as an example, we demonstrate a facile approach for creating high-surface-area stable nanosheets comprising nearly 100% exposed (001) facets. Our approach relies on spontaneous assembly of the nanosheets into three-dimensional hierarchical spheres, which stabilizes them from collapse. We show that the high surface density of exposed TiO2 (001) facets leads to fast lithium insertion\/deinsertion processes in batteries that mimic features seen in high-power electrochemical capacitors.",
                "The search for new electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been an important way to satisfy the ever-growing demands for better performance with higher energy\/power densities, improved safety and longer cycle life. Nanostructured metal oxides exhibit good electrochemical properties, and they are regarded as promising anode materials for high-performance LIBs. In this feature article, we will focus on three different categories of metal oxides with distinct lithium storage mechanisms: tin dioxide (SnO2), which utilizes alloying\/dealloying processes to reversibly store\/release lithium ions during charge\/discharge; titanium dioxide (TiO2), where lithium ions are inserted\/deinserted into\/out of the TiO2 crystal framework; and transition metal oxides including iron oxide and cobalt oxide, which react with lithium ions via an unusual conversion reaction. For all three systems, we will emphasize that creating \u2026",
                "We report the largely improved electrochemical capacitance of polypyrrole-derived microporous carbon nanospheres (MCNs, 80\u2013100 nm in diameter) containing nitrogen functional groups. We have investigated the electrochemical properties of precursor polypyrrole nanospheres (PNs, with a high N\/C ratio and low surface area) and as-derived carbon nanospheres (CNs, with a moderate N\/C ratio and low surface area) prepared by carbonizing PNs at different temperatures, and MCNs (with a low N\/C ratio and high surface area) obtained by chemical activation of CNs. The samples are thoroughly characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nitrogen sorption, elemental analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that MCNs with a high surface area and N-doping species exhibit much better \u2026",
                "Yolk\/shell or \u2018rattle-typed\u2019 nanomaterials with nanoparticle cores inside hollow shells are interesting among the complex hollow nanostructures. Yolk\/shell nanoparticles (YSNs) are promising functional nanomaterials for a variety of applications such as catalysis, delivery, lithium-ion batteries and biosensors due to their tailorability and functionality in both the cores and hollow shells. This feature article provides an overview of advances in this exciting area of YSNs, covering systematic synthesis approaches and key promising applications based on the literature and our own recent work. We present some strategies for the synthesis of YSNs with controllable sizes, compositions, geometries, structures and functionalities. Applications of these new materials in a wide range of potential areas are discussed including nanoreactors, biomedicine and lithium-ion batteries.

                "The development of new electrode materials for lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) has always been a focal area of materials science, as the current technology may not be able to meet the high energy demands for electronic devices with better performance. Among all the metal oxides, tin dioxide (SnO2) is regarded as a promising candidate to serve as the anode material for LIBs due to its high theoretical capacity. Here, a thorough survey is provided of the synthesis of SnO2\u2010based nanomaterials with various structures and chemical compositions, and their application as negative electrodes for LIBs. It covers SnO2 with different morphologies ranging from 1D nanorods\/nanowires\/nanotubes, to 2D nanosheets, to 3D hollow nanostructures. Nanocomposites consisting of SnO2 and different carbonaceous supports, e.g., amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, are also investigated. The use of Sn\u2010based \u2026",
                "In this work, a novel hydrothermal route is developed to synthesize cobalt carbonate hydroxide, Co(CO3)0.5(OH)\u00b70.11H2O. In this method, sodium chloride salt is utilized to organize single\u2010crystalline nanowires into a chrysanthemum\u2010like hierarchical assembly. The morphological evolution process of this organized product is investigated by examining different reaction intermediates during the synthesis. The growth and thus the final assembly of the Co(CO3)0.5(OH)\u00b70.11H2O can be finely tuned by selecting preparative parameters, such as the molar ratio of the starting chemicals, the additives, the reaction time and the temperature. Using the flower\u2010like Co(CO3)0.5(OH)\u00b70.11H2O as a solid precursor, quasi\u2010single\u2010crystalline mesoporous Co3O4 nanowire arrays are prepared via thermal decomposition in air. Furthermore, carbon can be added onto the spinel oxide by a chemical\u2010vapor\u2010deposition method using \u2026",
                "We report a simple glucose-mediated hydrothermal method for gram-scale synthesis of nearly monodisperse hybrid SnO2 nanoparticles. Glucose is found to play the dual role of facilitating rapid precipitation of polycrystalline SnO2 nanocolloids and in creating a uniform, glucose-derived, carbon-rich polysaccharide (GCP) coating on the SnO2 nanocores. The thickness of the GCP coating can be facilely manipulated by varying glucose concentration in the synthesis medium. Carbon-coated SnO2 nanocolloids obtained after carbonization of the GCP coating exhibit significantly enhanced cycling performance for lithium storage. Specifically, we find that a capacity of ca. 440 mA h\/g can be obtained after more than 100 charge\/discharge cycles at a current density of 300 mA\/g in hybrid SnO2-carbon electrodes containing as much as 1\/3 of their mass in the low-activity carbon shell.
