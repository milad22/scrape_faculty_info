                "Density functional theory is used to systematically study the electronic properties of doped MoS 2 monolayers, where the dopants are incorporated both via S\/Mo substitution or as adsorbates. Among the possible substitutional dopants at the Mo site, Nb is identified as suitable p-type dopant, while Re is the donor with the lowest activation energy. When dopants are simply adsorbed on a monolayer we find that alkali metals shift the Fermi energy into the MoS 2 conduction band, making the system n type. Finally, the adsorption of charged molecules is considered, mimicking an ionic liquid environment. We find that molecules adsorption can lead to both n-and p-type conductivity, depending on the charge polarity of the adsorbed species.",
                "Ab initio density functional theory calculations are performed to study the electronic properties of a MoS 2 monolayer deposited over a SiO 2 substrate in the presence of interface impurities and defects. When MoS 2 is placed on a defect-free substrate, the oxide plays an insignificant role since the conduction band top and the valence band minimum of MoS 2 are located approximately in the middle of the SiO 2 band gap. However, if Na impurities and O dangling bonds are introduced at the SiO 2 surface, these lead to localized states, which modulate the conductivity of the MoS 2 monolayer from n-to p-type. Our results show that the conductive properties of MoS 2 deposited on SiO 2 are mainly determined by the detailed structure of the MoS 2\/SiO 2 interface, and suggest that doping the substrate can represent a viable strategy for engineering MoS 2-based devices.",
                "Ab initio density functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the electronic structure of MoS2 armchair nanoribbons in the presence of an external static electric field. Such nanoribbons, which are nonmagnetic and semiconducting, exhibit a set of weakly interacting edge states whose energy position determines the band gap of the system. We show that, by applying an external transverse electric field, Eext, the nanoribbon band gap can be significantly reduced, leading to a metal\u2013insulator transition beyond a certain critical value. Moreover, the presence of a sufficiently high density of states at the Fermi level in the vicinity of the metal\u2013insulator transition leads to the onset of Stoner ferromagnetism that can be modulated, and even extinguished, by Eext. In the case of bilayer nanoribbons we further show that the band gap can be changed from indirect to direct by applying a transverse field, an effect that \u2026",
                "Two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been recently proposed as appealing candidate materials for spintronic applications owing to their distinctive atomic crystal structure and exotic physical properties arising from the large bonding anisotropy. Here we introduce the first MoS2-based spin-valves that employ monolayer MoS2 as the nonmagnetic spacer. In contrast with what is expected from the semiconducting band-structure of MoS2, the vertically sandwiched-MoS2 layers exhibit metallic behavior. This originates from their strong hybridization with the Ni and Fe atoms of the Permalloy (Py) electrode. The spin-valve effect is observed up to 240 K, with the highest magnetoresistance (MR) up to 0.73% at low temperatures. The experimental work is accompanied by the first principle electron transport calculations, which reveal an MR of \u223c9% for an ideal Py\/MoS2\/Py junction \u2026",
                "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are well-known to exhibit interesting phenomena due to quantum confinement. Here, we show that quantum confinement, together with structural anisotropy, result in an electric-field-tunable Dirac cone in 2D black phosphorus. Using density functional theory calculations, we find that an electric field, E ext, applied normal to a 2D black phosphorus thin film, can reduce the direct band gap of few-layer black phosphorus, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition at a critical field, E c. Increasing E ext beyond E c can induce a Dirac cone in the system, provided the black phosphorus film is sufficiently thin. The electric field strength can tune the position of the Dirac cone and the Dirac-Fermi velocities, the latter being similar in magnitude to that in graphene. We show that the Dirac cone arises from an anisotropic interaction term between the frontier orbitals that are spatially separated due \u2026",
                "We demonstrate giant magnetoresistance in Fe\/MoS 2\/Fe junctions by means of ab initio transport calculations. We show that junctions incorporating either a monolayer or a bilayer of MoS 2 are metallic and that Fe acts as an efficient spin injector into MoS 2 with an efficiency of about 45%. This is the result of the strong coupling between the Fe and S atoms at the interface. For junctions of greater thickness, a maximum magnetoresistance of\u223c 300% is obtained, which remains robust with the applied bias as long as transport is in the tunneling limit. A general recipe for improving the magnetoresistance in spin valves incorporating layered transition metal dichalcogenides is proposed.",
                "We use a first-principles based self-consistent momentum-resolved density fluctuation (MRDF) model to compute the combined effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions to describe the superconducting dome in the correlated MoS 2 thin flake and TiSe 2. We find that without including the electron-electron interaction, the electron-phonon coupling and the superconducting transition temperature (T c) are overestimated in both these materials. However, once the full angular and dynamical fluctuations of the spin and charge density induced quasiparticle self-energy effects are included, the electron-phonon coupling and T c are reduced to the experimental value. With doping, both electronic correlation and electron-phonon coupling grows, and above some doping value, the former becomes so large that it starts to reduce the quasiparticle-phonon coupling constant and T c, creating a \u2026",
                "Spin-memory loss (SML) of electrons traversing ferromagnetic-metal\/heavy-metal (FM\/HM), FM\/normal-metal (FM\/NM), and HM\/NM interfaces is a fundamental phenomenon that must be invoked to explain consistently large numbers of spintronic experiments. However, its strength extracted by fitting experimental data to phenomenological semiclassical theory, which replaces each interface by a fictitious bulk diffusive layer, is poorly understood from a microscopic quantum framework and\/or materials properties. Here we describe an ensemble of flowing spin quantum states using spin-density matrix, so that SML is measured like any decoherence process by the decay of its off-diagonal elements or, equivalently, by the reduction of the magnitude of polarization vector. By combining this framework with density functional theory, we examine how all three components of the polarization vector change at Co\/Ta, Co\/Pt \u2026",
                "The control of recently observed spintronic effects in topological-insulator\/ferromagnetic-metal (TI\/FM) heterostructures is thwarted by the lack of understanding of band structure and spin textures around their interfaces. Here we combine density functional theory with Green\u2019s function techniques to obtain the spectral function at any plane passing through atoms of Bi2Se3 and Co or Cu layers comprising the interface. Instead of naively assumed Dirac cone gapped by the proximity exchange field spectral function, we find that the Rashba ferromagnetic model describes the spectral function on the surface of Bi2Se3 in contact with Co near the Fermi level EF0, where circular and snowflake-like constant energy contours coexist around which spin locks to momentum. The remnant of the Dirac cone is hybridized with evanescent wave functions from metallic layers and pushed, due to charge transfer from Co or Cu layers \u2026",
                "Liquid-phase exfoliation of layered materials offers a large-scale approach toward the synthesis of 2D nanostructures. Structural properties of materials can however change during transition from bulk to the 2D state. Any such changes must be examined and understood for successful implementation of 2D nanostructures. In this work, we demonstrate nonbulk stacking sequences in the few-layer MoS2 and WS2 nanoflakes produced by liquid-phase exfoliation. Our analysis shows that nonbulk stacking sequences can be derived from its bulk counterparts by translational shifts of the layers. No structural changes within the layers were observed. Twenty-seven MoS2 and five WS2 nanoflakes were imaged and analyzed. Nine MoS2 and four WS2 nanoflakes displayed nonbulk stacking. Such dominance of the nonbulk stacking suggests high possibility of unusual stacking sequences in other 2D nanostructures. Notably \u2026"
