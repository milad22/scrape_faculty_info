After receiving his Ph.D., he worked as a research assistant at University College of Swansea, UK, and as a research associate at Kansas State University before coming to WMU in 1989. His research focuses on the problems of electron capture (electron transfer between the collision partners), ionization (electron removal from the atom or molecule) and excitation (electron jump within the atom or molecule) processes in low-velocity ion-atom\/molecule collisions through the study of the doubly differential (in translational energy-gain and projectile scattering angles) cross sections, by means of translational energy-gain spectroscopy. Processes studied in Kamber\u2019s research include state-selective dissociative and non-dissociative electron capture and collision-induced dissociation of metastable singly and doubly charged molecular ions. His experimental method combines translational energy-gain spectroscopy, coincident time-of-flight and position imaging techniques. The translational energy spectroscopy technique involves a precise measurement of the kinetic energies of the collision products, which leads to more quantitative information regarding the orbitals in which electrons are captured. Kamber\u2019s research program is centered on the use of a 6-MV tandem Van de Graaff accelerator and laboratory facilities including data analysis computer systems. The tandem provides fast ions for pumping a target atom or molecule to a low-energy but highly charged state for subsequent use as a projectile for low-energy ion-atom\/molecule collision studies. Results obtained since 1990 have provided the basis for five Master of Arts thesis projects and two Doctor of Philosophy dissertations at WMU. Email Emanuel Kamber"
