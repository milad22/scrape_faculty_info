                "We present the result of our most recent search for T violation in 205 Tl, which is interpreted in terms of an electric dipole moment of the electron d e. We find d e=(6.9\u00b17.4)\u00d7 10\u2212 28 e cm, which yields an upper limit| d e|\u2264 1.6\u00d7 10\u2212 27 e cm with 90% confidence. The present apparatus is a major upgrade of the atomic beam magnetic-resonance device used to set the previous limit on d e.",
                "New results are reported in our search for the electric dipole moment d e of the electron in the ground 6 2 P 1\/2 state of Tl 205. The atomic-beam magnetic resonance method is employed with separated oscillating fields. A magnetic field B defines the axis of quantization, and an electric field E, parallel to B, is applied in the region between the oscillating fields. Laser optical pumping is used for state selection and analysis, and the signal is fluorescence accompanying the decay of excited atoms in the analyzer region. The signature of a nonzero electric dipole moment is a dependence of the signal on the P, T-odd rotational invariant E\u22c5 B (P and T denote parity and time reversal, respectively). Two counterpropagating atomic beams are employed to reduce a systematic effect due to the motional magnetic field E\u00d7 v\/c. Auxiliary experiments are performed to isolate and eliminate residual sources of systematic error. The \u2026",
                "Transmission electron microscopy is a powerful imaging tool that has found broad application in materials science, nanoscience and biology 1, 2, 3. With the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial resolution and the image quality in transmission electron microscopy have been significantly improved 4, 5 and resolution below 0.5 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms has been demonstrated 6. To reveal the three-dimensional (3D) structure of thin samples, electron tomography is the method of choice 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, with cubic-nanometre resolution currently achievable 10, 11. Discrete tomography has recently been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver nanoparticle two to three nanometres in diameter 12, but this statistical method assumes prior knowledge of the particle\u2019s lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit rigidly on that lattice.

                "The development of manipulation tools that are not too \u2018fat\u2019or too \u2018sticky\u2019for atomic scale assembly is an important challenge facing nanotechnology 1. Impressive nanofabrication capabilities have been demonstrated with scanning probe manipulation of atoms 2, 3, 4, 5 and molecules 4, 6 on clean surfaces. However, as fabrication tools, both scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopes suffer from a loading deficiency: although they can manipulate atoms already present, they cannot efficiently deliver atoms to the work area. Carbon nanotubes, with their hollow cores and large aspect ratios, have been suggested 7, 8 as possible conduits for nanoscale amounts of material. Already much effort has been devoted to the filling of nanotubes 8, 9, 10, 11 and the application of such techniques 12, 13. Furthermore, carbon nanotubes have been used as probes in scanning probe microscopy 14, 15, 16. If the atomic \u2026",
                "Dislocations and their interactions strongly influence many material properties, ranging from the strength of metals and alloys to the efficiency of light-emitting diodes and laser diodes 1, 2, 3, 4. Several experimental methods can be used to visualize dislocations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has long been used to image dislocations in materials 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and high-resolution electron microscopy can reveal dislocation core structures in high detail 10, particularly in annular dark-field mode 11. A TEM image, however, represents a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional (3D) object (although stereo TEM provides limited information about 3D dislocations 4). X-ray topography can image dislocations in three dimensions, but with reduced resolution 12. Using weak-beam dark-field TEM 13 and scanning TEM 14, electron tomography has been used to image 3D dislocations at a resolution of \u2026",
                "Modern microelectronic devices have nanoscale features that dissipate power nonuniformly, but fundamental physical limits frustrate efforts to detect the resulting temperature gradients. Contact thermometers disturb the temperature of a small system, while radiation thermometers struggle to beat the diffraction limit. Exploiting the same physics as Fahrenheit\u2019s glass-bulb thermometer, we mapped the thermal expansion of Joule-heated, 80-nanometer-thick aluminum wires by precisely measuring changes in density. With a scanning transmission electron microscope and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we quantified the local density via the energy of aluminum\u2019s bulk plasmon. Rescaling density to temperature yields maps with a statistical precision of 3 kelvin\/hertz\u22121\/2, an accuracy of 10%, and nanometer-scale resolution. Many common metals and semiconductors have sufficiently sharp plasmon resonances to \u2026",
                "Resistive switching (RS) is an interesting property shown by some materials systems that, especially during the last decade, has gained a lot of interest for the fabrication of electronic devices, with electronic nonvolatile memories being those that have received the most attention. The presence and quality of the RS phenomenon in a materials system can be studied using different prototype cells, performing different experiments, displaying different figures of merit, and developing different computational analyses. Therefore, the real usefulness and impact of the findings presented in each study for the RS technology will be also different. This manuscript describes the most recommendable methodologies for the fabrication, characterization, and simulation of RS devices, as well as the proper methods to display the data obtained. The idea is to help the scientific community to evaluate the real usefulness and impact \u2026",
                "Growth of graphene on copper (100) single crystals by chemical vapor deposition has been accomplished. The atomic structure of the graphene overlayer was studied using scanning tunneling microscopy. A detailed analysis of moire\u0301 superstructures present in the graphene topography reveals that growth occurs in a variety of orientations over the square atomic lattice of the copper surface. Transmission electron microscopy was used to elucidate the crystallinity of the grown graphene. Pristine, defect-free graphene was observed over copper steps, corners, and screw dislocations. Distinct protrusions, known as \u201cflower\u201d structures, were observed on flat terraces, which are attributed to carbon structures that depart from the characteristic honeycomb lattice. Continuous graphene growth also occurs over copper adatoms and atomic vacancies present at the single-crystal surface. The copper atom mobility within \u2026",
                "An ideal technique for observing nanoscale assembly would provide atomic-resolution images of both the products and the reactants in real time. Using a transmission electron microscope we image in situ the electrochemical deposition of lead from an aqueous solution of lead(II) nitrate. Both the lead deposits and the local Pb2+ concentration can be visualized. Depending on the rate of potential change and the potential history, lead deposits on the cathode in a structurally compact layer or in dendrites. In both cases the deposits can be removed and the process repeated. Asperities that persist through many plating and stripping cycles consistently nucleate larger dendrites. Quantitative digital image analysis reveals excellent correlation between changes in the Pb2+ concentration, the rate of lead deposition, and the current passed by the electrochemical cell.
