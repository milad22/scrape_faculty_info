PhD, University of California, Los Angeles, 2000 Dr. Silverstone is an observational astronomer investigating the process of planet formation around nearby stars. Dr. Silverstone\u2019s research focuses on circumstellar disk detection & imaging. Specifically, he uses high-contrast imaging of the light scattered by the dust grains orbiting in circumstellar disks, using the coronagraphs in the Hubble Space Telescope\u2019s Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) to identify the signposts of planets that have formed, or are forming, and studying the conditions under which the disk\/planets grow. Dr. Silverstone also uses infrared & sub-millimeter wavelength measurements of the thermal emission from such grains to further elucidate the distribution and nature of the dust grains in these disks. Dr. Silverstone received his doctoral degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2000. He joined the Department of Physics & Astronomy as an instructor in 2010, and joined faculty of The University of Alabama in August 2015. "
