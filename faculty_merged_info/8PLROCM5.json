                "Synchrotron radiation photoemission has been used to study the interaction of H2O with defective and nearly-perfect TiO2(110) surfaces at temperatures between 160 and 300 K. Ti3+ 3d defect sites are implicated in the adsorption process, and by tuning the photon energy to 47 eV we find that a resonant photoernission process gives an enhanced photoermission sensitivity to the 3d defect states. Defects are produced on TiO2(110) by annealing to 1000 K in UHV; subsequent exposure to 104 L O2 produces nearly perfect surfaces, based on the suppressed Ti3d emission. Both nearly perfect and defective surfaces give rise to dissociative adsorption of H2O at 300 K. The saturation coverages are near 0.1 ML, independent of the initial defect concentration; however, the rate of dissociative adsorption (sticking probability) is higher on defective surfaces. The enhanced sensitivity to the Ti3+ defect states has allowed \u2026",
                "The direct reduction of CO 2 to CH 3 OH is known to occur at several types of electrocatalysts including oxidized Cu electrodes. In this work, we examine the yield behavior of an electrodeposited cuprous oxide thin film and explore relationships between surface chemistry and reaction behavior relative to air-oxidized and anodized Cu electrodes. CH 3 OH yields (43 \u03bcmol cm\u2212 2 h\u2212 1) and Faradaic efficiencies (38%) observed at cuprous oxide electrodes were remarkably higher than air-oxidized or anodized Cu electrodes suggesting Cu (I) species may play a critical role in selectivity to CH 3 OH. Experimental results also show CH 3 OH yields are dynamic and the copper oxides are reduced to metallic Cu in a simultaneous process. Yield behavior is discussed in comparison with photoelectrochemical and hydrogenation reactions where the improved stability of Cu (I) species may allow continuous CH 3 OH generation.",
                "The intrinsic electronic surface-state structure in the region of the bulk band gap for the (110),(100), and (001) surfaces of Ti O 2 (rutile) has been determined by fracturing single-crystal samples in ultrahigh vacuum and measuring their ultraviolet photoemission spectra. None of the faces exhibits an appreciable density of surface states in the bulk band gap, in disagreement with recent calculations for the Ti O 2 (001) surface by Kasowski and Tait. The atomic geometry of both perfect and defect surfaces is examined, and the incomplete screening of pairs of surface cations at defect sites is suggested to give rise to occupied band-gap surface states rather than the coordinative unsaturation of surface cations. Hydrogen-exposure experiments indicate that Ti O 2 surfaces may not interact as strongly with hydrogen as has been suggested.",
                "We present valence and core-level photoemission measurements from vacuum-fractured, single-crystal barium titanate. These results resolve contradictory measurements in the literature which have employed other methods of sample surface preparation. The valence-shell electronic structure is compared with previously published results of band structure and cluster calculations. Resonant photoemission is used to probe the covalent coupling between titanium and oxygen in the cubic and tetragonal phases of this ionic compound. Photoelectron spectra of the Ti 2p and O 1s core levels reveal the valence of these two ions to be TiO 2-like. Valence, core, satellite, and Auger transitions are also assigned and tabulated.",
                "Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of a 93-K superconducting compound, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 have been obtained using photon energies ranging from 60 to 106 eV. Resonant photoemission is used to identify the chemical origin of the features in the valence-band electronic structure.",
                "Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy has been used to study the electronic structure of both nearly stoichiometric, well-ordered \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 surfaces and surfaces containing point defects. The interaction of O 2, H 2 O, H 2, and SO 2 with both types of surfaces has also been investigated. The energy levels of the five 3d electrons on the Fe 3+ ions overlap those of the filled O 2p orbitals, leading to a complex valence band about 10 eV wide. Oxygen-vacancy surface defects produced by Ar+-ion bombardment result in a conducting surface layer containing both Fe 2+ and Fe 0 ions. The well-ordered \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (0001) surface is relatively inert with respect to all four molecules studied, with exposures greater than 10 3 L (1 L\u2261 10\u2212 6 Torr sec) necessary before any chemisorption could be seen. For large exposures, the O 2-surface interaction gives rise to a negative adsorbed species. H 2 O adsorbs dissociatively on \u2026",
                "The surface composition and geometric structure of single-crystal \u03b1-Fe2O3(001) has been studied for a variety of surface preparations. Sputter-etching produces a disordered, oxygen deficient surface exhibiting several Fe valence states. Annealing in vacuum results in ordered surfaces having stoichiometries approaching that of the bulk. Two distinct surface structural phases are observed upon annealing; a p(2 \u00d7 2) structure is produced by heating to 700\u00b0C, and an incommensurate overlayer forms upon heating to 820\u00b0C. The results are discussed in terms of plausible models of surface composition and cation configuration.",
                "When clean, vacuum-fractured surfaces of BaTiO 3 are analyzed using ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS and XPS), more than one set of barium core levels is observed. Sputtering the surface with ions removes lower-binding-energy intensity within the barium line shapes in UPS spectra while little change is noted in XPS. Sputtering of the surface also causes band bending and the creation of band-gap surface states of Ti 3d character. From a comparison of UPS and XPS Ba 4d line shapes from a vacuum-fractured surface, the lower-binding-energy component is assigned to barium with 12-fold oxygen coordination representative of bulk stoichiometry; the higher-binding-energy intensity originates from undercoordinated barium in the region of the sample surface. Such a negative chemical shift of core levels with increased coordination has been observed in the oxidation of metallic barium as \u2026",
                "The influence of the surface geometric structure on the electron and photon-stimulated desorption (ESD, PSD) ion yield from TiO2(001) and TiO2(110) has been studied. For both surfaces, angle-integrated ESD yields have been measured as a function of annealing temperature ranging from room temperature sputtered surfaces to 1200 K annealed surfaces. These measurements imply that the local geometry of the desorption site must be considered in order to adequately explain the observed ion yield variations. The ESD ion angular distribution (ESDIAD) patterns have been obtained after annealing in the temperature range 300\u20131200 K. These patterns show the presence of short-range structural order, even on highly defective, sputtered surfaces, and they are interpreted in terms of plausible models of surface structure. Changes in both the surface Ti-cation valence state and its coordination number as a function \u2026",
                "The surface electronic structure of single-crystal V 2 O 3 has been studied by using ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both nearly-perfect surfaces and surfaces containing point defects have been prepared, and the influence of O 2 and H 2 O on both types of surfaces has been investigated. Cation core-level spectra from cleaved surfaces exhibit complex structure. The surface electronic band structure is similar to that of the bulk; at room temperature, V 2 O 3 is metallic with the Fermi level E F lying within the overlapping V (3 d) a 1 g and e g \u03c0 conduction bands. A minimum in the density of states occurs between the V (3 d) and O (2 p) bands at 3 eV below E F. The O (2 p) valence band has a width of 5.5-6 eV. Surface defects produced by Ar+-ion bombardment are associated with O vacancies and a net charge transfer to V (3 d) levels. O 2 interacts strongly with both perfect surfaces and surface defects \u2026"

These techniques can be profitably\n                  applied to many different materials of fundamental scientific and technological interest,\n                  ranging from high-temperature superconductors, modified magnetic materials, metal-on-metal\n                  catalysts, and metal-semiconductor or metal-superconductor interfaces. There are a number of surface-sensitive experimental techniques that I am interested\n                  in implementing that use synchrotron radiation. The primary technique is photoelectron spectroscopy . This has been an invaluable tool in studies of the electronic structure of semiconductors\n                  and has recently played a similar role in studies of high-temperature superconductors.\n                  Using these techinques, one can map out band structures, obtain information on chemical\n                  configurations, bond morphologies, etc.. A number of other spectroscopies will be\n                  used in conjunction with photoemission, including photoelectron diffraction, near-edge\n                  absorption measurements, and studies of desorbing species, including ions, metastables\n                  and neutrals. All of these techniques give complementary electronic and geometric\n                  structural information and will be brought to bear on solving the problems involved\n                  with the materials of interest. I am also interested implementing many of the experimental techniques available to\n                  the surface scientist, including Auger electron spectroscopy, LEED, ESDIAD, etc.,\n                  where the results from these studies are pertinent to the problems of interest. In addition to expanding my research on oxides, semiconductors, and superconductors,\n                  I maintain an interest in a broad variety of physical problems ranging from problems\n                  of technological interest to those of the most fundamental importance in modern physics.\n                  As such, I hope to continue and develop productive interactions with local associates\n                  as well as expanding collaborations with both national and international colleagues.
