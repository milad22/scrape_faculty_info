                "Room-temperature infrared sub-band gap photoresponse in silicon is of interest for telecommunications, imaging and solid-state energy conversion. Attempts to induce infrared response in silicon largely centred on combining the modification of its electronic structure via controlled defect formation (for example, vacancies and dislocations) with waveguide coupling, or integration with foreign materials. Impurity-mediated sub-band gap photoresponse in silicon is an alternative to these methods but it has only been studied at low temperature. Here we demonstrate impurity-mediated room-temperature sub-band gap photoresponse in single-crystal silicon-based planar photodiodes. A rapid and repeatable laser-based hyperdoping method incorporates supersaturated gold dopant concentrations on the order of 10 20 cm\u2212 3 into a single-crystal surface layer~ 150 nm thin. We demonstrate room-temperature silicon \u2026",
                "We analyze optical-absorption and Raman-scattering measurements of CdS-and Zn-doped borosilicate glass, heat treated at 600 C to 725 C, to study the nucleation and growth of II-VI nanoparticles. The energy of vibrational Raman modes indicates that Cd 1\u2212 x Zn x S crystallites form where x is initially zero and increases to 0.15 with time. In glass which is quenched from high temperature (> 1000 C) there is a weak, monotonic optical absorption which increases with photon energy. Heat treatment at 600 C to 725 C causes the optical absorption to increase and to form a peak between 3.0 and 3.2 eV. After the peak reaches its maximum value, it begins to shift to lower energy. We interpret the optical data in terms of quantum confinement of electron and hole excited states. We conclude that nucleation of particles in this glass composition is homogeneous. Typical critical nuclei are in the range from 1.5 to 2 nm. The \u2026",

                "We show how Raman optic\u2010mode peak positions and relative intensities can be used in a straightforward way to determine crystallite composition in CdSxSe1\u2212x nanocrystals embedded in glass. These Raman techniques are particularly useful for low\u2010concentration or small\u2010crystallite\u2010size composites where x\u2010ray diffraction is not a viable technique for structural characterization of crystallites.",
                "Pressure-tuned resonant Raman scattering was used to determine the band-gap shift due to quantum size effects of microcrystalline CdS in glass composites and colloids. The wurtzite-to rocksalt-phase-transition behavior in the microcrystallite CdS systems was also studied and is quite different from that in bulk CdS. This different behavior is attributed to the large number of defects in microcrystallite CdS systems. We systematically investigated these defect properties in terms of the pressure coefficients of the photoluminescence peaks. This work demonstrates that the main defects in the CdS-glass composites are cadmium vacancies, V Cd; whereas in the CdS colloids the defects consist of cadmium vacancies, V Cd; sulfur vacancies, V S; interstitial sulfur, I S; and cadmium atoms adsorbed on the surface, S Cd.",
                "The need to decrease signal delay and cross-talk in interconnects within integrated circuits is becoming increasingly important as device dimensions shrink. Electrical connections require lower resistivity metals and lower dielectric constant insulating films to meet future goals. Even these materials may not provide for sufficient signal bandwidth, and so optical interconnections are also envisioned. Porous materials offer the opportunity to fabricate scaleable dielectric constant materials for both electrical and optical interconnections. At Rensselaer, we have been working on projects using porous silica materials (xerogels) as low-k dielectrics for electrical interconnections and as low refractive index \u2018cladding\u2019 materials for optical interconnections. This paper focuses on the relationship between the porosity of the material and its optical, electrical, interfacial and mechanical properties. We find porosity has profound \u2026"
