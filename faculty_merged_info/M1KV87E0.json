                "Assemblage structure and juvenile recruitment of fishes was compared amongst three habitats: seagrass, Heterozostera tasmanica (Martens ex Aschers.) den Hartog; reef-algal; and unvegetated sand. Sampling was conducted monthly from October 1993 to March 1994 at three locations in Port Phillip Bay, southern Australia. A fine-mesh seine net was used to sample subtidally at a depth of approximately 0.5 m. Fish assemblages differed primarily between structured habitats and unvegetated sand, and a number of species previously reported to occur in seagrass habitat were also found to utilise reef-algal habitat. Species richness was highest in seagrass and lowest in unvegetated sand with significant differences amongst all habitats. Total abundance varied between habitats depending on location and month examined, but the most common pattern was highest abundance in seagrass and lowest in unvegetated \u2026",
                "The natural history of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease associated with solid organ transplantation has been modified as a result of the widespread use of antiviral prophylaxis. Anecdotal reports have indicated a reduction of CMV disease at the expense of its later occurrence after completion of ganciclovir prophylaxis. The present study investigated the occurrence of CMV disease and its risk factors among 37 liver and kidney transplant recipients with CMV D+\/R\u2212 status who received oral ganciclovir during the first 100 days posttransplantation. CMV disease occurred in 9 patients (24.3%) at a median of 144 days posttransplantation (range, 95\u2013190 days). Allograft rejection was found to be strongly associated with the occurrence of late-onset CMV disease (risk ratio, 6.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4\u201332.1; P=.02). Thus, CMV D+\/R\u2212 solid organ transplant recipients receiving 3 months of oral ganciclovir who \u2026",
                "Management areas are used in marine spatial planning to conserve biodiversity of marine ecosystems and to protect fish from fishing pressure. To evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas, observational techniques are used to determine densities, sizes, biomass, habitat types and distribution of fish species in and around management areas. Two types of observational techniques are used in spatial monitoring: (1) fishery-independent techniques, which include underwater visual census (UVC), underwater video, remote sensing, acoustics, and experimental catch and effort data; and (2) fishery-dependent techniques, which include catch, effort and catch per unit effort data from commercial and recreational fisheries. This review summarises the applications, advantages, disadvantages and biases of each of these observational categories and highlights emerging technologies. The main finding from this \u2026",
                "Species richness, abundance and biomass of fishes from seagrass and unvegetated habitats were analysed for sites in the Swan Bay region of Port Phillip Bay, and Corner Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Fish assemblages from intertidalZostera muellerisites showed greater similarity with a number of shallower unvegetated sites than to subtidalHeterozostera tasmanica. Similarly, subtidal, unvegetated sites in Swan Bay were more similar to subtidalHeterozosterasites than to other, generally shallower, unvegetated sites. Species richness was significantly higher in seagrass beds and showed an increase over the warmer months of the year. Differences in abundance and biomass of fishes between vegetated and unvegetated habitats depended on the location of sampling. In general, abundance and biomass of fish in the deeper subtidal seagrass were significantly higher than in unvegetated habitats of the same depth. In \u2026",
                "Estuaries are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because changes in climatic and hydrologic variables that influence freshwater and marine systems will also affect estuaries. We review potential impacts of climate change on Australian estuaries and their fish. Geographic differences are likely because southern Australian climates are predicted to become warmer and drier, whereas northern regions may see increased precipitation. Environmental factors, including salinity gradients, suspended sediment, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations, will be influenced by changing freshwater input and other climate variables. Potential impacts will vary depending on the geomorphology of the estuary and the level of build-up of sand bars across estuarine entrances. Changes to estuarine fish assemblages will depend on associated changes to salinity and estuarine-mouth morphology. Marine \u2026",
                "Spatial variation in the chemistry (Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba) of recently deposited otolith material (last 20\u201330 days of life) was compared between two demersal fish species; snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae) and sand flathead Platycephalus bassensis (Platycephalidae), that were collected simultaneously at 12 sites across three bays in Victoria, south\u2010eastern Australia. Otolith chemistry was also compared with ambient water chemistry and among three sampling positions adjacent to the proximal otolith margin. For both species, variation in otolith chemistry among bays was significant for Ba, Mn and Sr; however, differences among bays were only similar between species for Ba and Mn. Only Ba showed significant variation at the site level. Across the 12 sites, mean otolith Ba levels were significantly positively correlated between species. Further, although incorporation rates differed, mean ambient Ba levels for both \u2026",
                "Post-settlement King George whiting Sillaginodes punctata were sampled every 3 to 4 d from mid-September to the end of October 1993, at 3 seagrass sites within Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The site closest to the entrance (St Leonards) showed short-lived pulses of recruits in low numbers. The site of intermediate distance into the bay (Grassy Point) showed a similar pattern; however, in this case there was a marked accumulation of recruits over time. In contrast, recruitment was low at the site furthest into the bay (Grand Scenlc), and the pattern was unlike the other sites. We simulated the transport of S punctata larvae into Port Phillip Bay over th~ s penod using 2-and 3-dimensional hydrodynamic and dlspersal models. A hlgh proportion (two-thirds) of the variation in recruitment at St Leonards and Grassy Point could be explained by 2 factors. the predicted arrival of larvae based on passlve transport by currents, and \u2026",
                "Determining contributions of juveniles from different areas to adult populations is difficult using traditional methods such as manual tagging and recapture. Environmental variation can, however, produce natural chemical tags in the otoliths of juvenile fish. Spatial variation in the otolith chemistry (Ba, Sr, Mn) of age 0+ snapper collected from inlets along the coast of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, enabled characterisation of otolith chemical tags for specific areas. In particular, a tag based largely on high Ba levels was specific to snapper from the largest juvenile area and most important fishery, Port Phillip Bay. This tag enabled accurate discrimination between snapper from this bay (98 and 85%) and other Victorian nursery areas in the 2000 and 2001 year classes, respectively. Differences in classification accuracy between these year classes were due to lower Ba levels in otoliths from some sites within Port Phillip \u2026",
                "Chronological variation in otolith chemistry can be used to reconstruct migration histories of fish. The use of otolith chemistry to study migration, however, requires knowledge of relationships between the chemical properties of the water and elemental incorporation into otoliths, and how water chemistry varies in space and time. We explored the potential for otolith chemistry of snapper, Pagrus auratus, to provide information on movement history between a large semi-enclosed bay, Port Phillip, and coastal waters in south-eastern Australia. Comparisons of water chemistry across two years demonstrated that ambient barium (Ba) levels in Port Phillip Bay were approximately double those in coastal waters (11 \u03bcg L\u22121 versus 6 \u03bcg L\u22121). Ba levels in otolith margins of wild juvenile snapper were highly positively correlated with ambient levels across 17 sampling locations, and levels in otolith margins of adult snapper \u2026",
                " The spatial, diel and tidal variability in the abundance of piscivorous fishes and their teleost prey, and the dietary composition of predatory fishes were investigated in beds of Heterozostera tasmanica within Port Phillip Bay, Australia, from September 1997 to February 1998. Predatory and prey fish assemblages were sampled from beds of H. tasmanica at three locations during each combination of diel (day and night) and tidal (high and low) cycles. Pelagic and benthic crustaceans represented >60% by abundance of the diets of all predatory fishes. Seven species, 54% of all predatory fishes, were piscivorous. These piscivores consumed individuals from seven families, 36.8% of the fish families being associated with seagrass. Western Australian salmon, Arripis truttacea (Arripidae) (n\u2009=\u2009174) and yank flathead, Platycephalus speculator (Platycephalidae) (n\u2009=\u200946) were the most abundant piscivores.
