                "The optimal time for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy for asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is uncertain.We conducted two parallel analyses involving a total of 17,517 asymptomatic patients with HIV infection in the United States and Canada who received medical care during the period from 1996 through 2005. None of the patients had undergone previous antiretroviral therapy. In each group, we stratified the patients according to the CD4+ count (351 to 500 cells per cubic millimeter or >500 cells per cubic millimeter) at the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. In each group, we compared the relative risk of death for patients who initiated therapy when the CD4+ count was above each of the two thresholds of interest (early-therapy group) with that of patients who deferred therapy until the CD4+ count fell below these thresholds (deferred-therapy group \u2026",
                "Competing events can preclude the event of interest from occurring in epidemiologic data and can be analyzed by using extensions of survival analysis methods. In this paper, the authors outline 3 regression approaches for estimating 2 key quantities in competing risks analysis: the cause-specific relative hazard (csRH) and the subdistribution relative hazard (sdRH). They compare and contrast the structure of the risk sets and the interpretation of parameters obtained with these methods. They also demonstrate the use of these methods with data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study established in 1993, treating time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy or to clinical disease progression as competing events. In our example, women with an injection drug use history were less likely than those without a history of injection drug use to initiate therapy prior to progression to acquired \u2026",
                "  Background. \u2003Anal cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), although few have evaluated rates separately for men who have sex with men (MSM), other men, and women. There are also conflicting data regarding calendar trends.  Methods. \u2003In a study involving 13 cohorts from North America with follow-up between 1996 and 2007, we compared anal cancer incidence rates among 34\u2009189 HIV-infected (55% MSM, 19% other men, 26% women) and 114\u2009260 HIV-uninfected individuals (90% men).  Results. \u2003Among men, the unadjusted anal cancer incidence rates per 100\u2009000 person-years were 131 for HIV-infected MSM, 46 for other HIV-infected men, and 2 for HIV-uninfected men, corresponding to demographically adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 80.3 (95% confidence \u2026",
                "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis. To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e. \u201cconvalescent\u201d) plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and\/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been \u2026",
                "ObjectiveWe examined the independent effect of alcohol and combined effects of drug and alcohol use on antiretroviral (ART) utilization, adherence, and viral suppression in an urban cohort of HIV-infected individuals.MethodsIn an observational clinical cohort, alcohol use, active drug use, and adherence were prospectively assessed at 6-month intervals. We classified hazardous alcohol use as> 7 drinks\/week or> 3 drinks\/occasion in women, and> 14 drinks\/week or> 4 drinks\/occasion in men and active drug use as any use in the previous 6 months. Our outcomes included ART utilization, 2-week adherence, and viral suppression. We used generalized estimating equations to analyze the association between independent variables and outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, years on ART, and clinic enrollment time.ResultsBetween 1998 and 2003, 1711 individuals participated in 5028 interviews \u2026",
                "Alternatives to liver biopsy for staging liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) have not appeared accurate enough for widespread clinical use. We characterized the magnitude of the impact of error in the \u201cgold standard\u201d on the observed diagnostic accuracy of surrogate markers.We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for a surrogate marker against the gold standard (biopsy) for a range of possible performances of each test (biopsy and marker) against truth and a gradient of clinically significant disease prevalence.In the \u2018best\u2019 scenario where liver biopsy accuracy is highest (sensitivity and specificity of biopsy are 90%) and the prevalence of significant disease 40%, the calculated AUROC would be 0.90 for a perfect marker (99% actual accuracy) which is within the range of what has already been observed.

                "  Background.  Little is known about the racial differences in the incidence and progression of HIV-related chronic kidney disease (CKD) that underlie African American\u2014white disparities in HIV-related end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  Methods.  In a cohort in Baltimore, Maryland, we measured CKD incidence, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope, and progression to ESRD in 3332 African American and 927 white HIV-infected subjects.  Results.  A total of 284 subjects developed CKD, 100 (35%) of whom subsequently developed ESRD. African American subjects were at slightly increased risk for incident CKD, compared with white subjects (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.2\u20132.8]). However, once CKD had commenced, the African American subjects developed ESRD markedly faster than did the white subjects (HR, 17.7 [95 \u2026",
                "Limited data on acute-phase C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection exist.We obtained a single measurement of CRP from 513 HIV-infected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study to examine the association between CRP and immune suppression and progression to AIDS. We estimated changes in CRP during the course of HIV infection in 81 of these individuals using specimens collected from October 1, 1984, to December 31, 1996.The cross-sectional associations between log10CRP were correlated inversely with CD4 lymphocyte counts (r = \u22120.17;P<.001) and directly with log10HIV RNA levels (r = 0.20;P<.001). Levels of CRP of more than 2.3 mg\/L were associated with a decreased time to the development of AIDS (relative time to AIDS, 0.36;P<.001) compared with individuals with CRP levels of 1.2 mg\/L or less, which remained \u2026",
                "CONTEXT: HIV-1 RNA and lymphocyte subset levels are the principal indications for antiretroviral treatment. Past reports have differed with regard to the effect of gender and race on these measures and in measures of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To assess racial and gender differences in HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ lymphocyte decline. DESIGN: A longitudinal study based in the two largest HIV natural history cohort studies conducted in 7 metropolitan areas of the United States. RESULTS: In all, 1256 adult women and 1603 adult men for whom multiple data points were available prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy were included. Women were more likely to be nonwhite, to have a history of injection drug use, and to have HIV-associated symptoms. After adjustment for differences in measurement method, baseline CD4+ cell count, age, and clinical symptoms, HIV-1 RNA levels were 32% to 50% lower in women than in men at CD4+ counts> 200 cells\/mm3 (p<. 001) but not at CD4+ cell counts< 200 cells\/mm3. HIV-1 RNA levels were also 41% lower in nonwhites than in whites (p<. 001) and 21% lower in persons reporting a prior history of injection drug use (p<. 001). Women had more rapid declines in CD4+ cell counts over time than men (difference in slope of 46 cells\/year) and nonwhite individuals had slower decline in CD4 cell counts than whites (difference of 39 cells\/year). CONCLUSIONS: Both race and gender influence the values of HIV-1 RNA and the rate of HIV-1 disease progression as indicated by decline in CD4 cell counts over time. These effects could provide clues regarding the factors that influence HIV-disease \u2026",
