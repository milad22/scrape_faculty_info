                "Recent demonstrations of magnetization switching induced by in-plane current in heavy metal\/ferromagnetic heterostructures (HMFHs) have drawn great attention to spin torques arising from large spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC). Given the intrinsic strong SOC, topological insulators (TIs) are expected to be promising candidates for exploring spin\u2013orbit torque (SOT)-related physics. Here we demonstrate experimentally the magnetization switching through giant SOT induced by an in-plane current in a chromium-doped TI bilayer heterostructure. The critical current density required for switching is below 8.9\u00d7 10 4 A cm\u2212 2 at 1.9 K. Moreover, the SOT is calibrated by measuring the effective spin\u2013orbit field using second-harmonic methods. The effective field to current ratio and the spin-Hall angle tangent are almost three orders of magnitude larger than those reported for HMFHs. The giant SOT and efficient current-induced \u2026",
                "Magnetization switching by current-induced spin\u2013orbit torques is of great interest due to its potential applications in ultralow-power memory and logic devices. The switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetization is of particular technological relevance. However, in such materials, the presence of an in-plane external magnetic field is typically required to assist spin\u2013orbit torque-driven switching and this is an obstacle for practical applications. Here, we report the switching of out-of-plane magnetized Ta\/Co 20 Fe 60 B 20\/TaO x structures by spin\u2013orbit torques driven by in-plane currents, without the need for any external magnetic fields. This is achieved by introducing a lateral structural asymmetry into our devices, which gives rise to a new field-like spin\u2013orbit torque when in-plane current flows in these structures. The direction of the current-induced effective field corresponding to this field-like spin\u2013orbit \u2026",
                "A theory is presented of quantum criticality in open (coupled to reservoirs) itinerant-electron magnets, with nonequilibrium drive provided by current flow across the system. Both departures from equilibrium at conventional (equilibrium) quantum critical points and the physics of phase transitions induced by the nonequilibrium drive are treated. Nonequilibrium-induced phase transitions are found to have the same leading critical behavior as conventional thermal phase transitions.",
                "A theoretical proposal for realizing and detecting spin supercurrent in an isotropic antiferromagnetic insulator is reported. Superfluid spin transport is achieved by inserting the antiferromagnet between two metallic reservoirs and establishing a spin accumulation in one reservoir such that a spin bias is applied across the magnet. We consider a class of bipartite antiferromagnets with N\u00e9el ground states, and temperatures well below the ordering temperature, where spin transport is mediated essentially by the condensate. Landau-Lifshitz and magnetocircuit theories are used to directly relate spin current in different parts of the heterostructure to the spin-mixing conductances characterizing the antiferromagnet| metal interfaces and the antiferromagnet bulk damping parameters, quantities all obtainable from experiments. We study the efficiency of spin angular-momentum transfer at an antiferromagnet| metal interface \u2026",
                "Superfluid spin transport\u2014dissipationless transport of spin\u2014is theoretically studied in a ferromagnetic insulator with easy-plane anisotropy. We consider an open geometry where the spin current is injected into the ferromagnet from one side by a metallic reservoir with a nonequilibrium spin accumulation and ejected into another metallic reservoir located downstream. Spin transport is studied using a combination of magnetoelectric circuit theory, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and microscopic linear-response theory. We discuss how spin superfluidity can be probed in a magnetically mediated negative electron-drag experiment.",
                "We theoretically consider the ubiquitous soft gap measured in the tunneling conductance of semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures, in which recently observed signatures of elusive Majorana bound states have created much excitement. We systematically study the effects of magnetic and nonmagnetic disorder, temperature, dissipative Cooper pair breaking, and interface inhomogeneity, which could lead to a soft gap. We find that interface inhomogeneity with moderate dissipation is the only viable mechanism that is consistent with the experimental observations. Our work indicates that improving the quality of the superconductor-semiconductor interface should result in a harder induced gap.",
                "We prepare the high quality epitaxial MgO(001)[100]\/Pt(001)[100]\/NiO(001)[100]\/FeNi\/SiO2 films to investigate the spin transport in the NiO antiferromagnetic insulator. The ferromagnetic resonance measurements of the FeNi under a spin current injection from the Pt by the spin Hall effect revealed the change of the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth depending on the amount of the spin current injection. The results can be interpreted that there is an angular momentum transfer through the NiO. A high efficient angular momentum transfer we observed in the epitaxial NiO can be attributed to the well-defined orientation of the antiferromagnetic moments and the spin quantization axis of the injected spin current.",
                "We develop a theory for spin transported by coherent N\u00e9el dynamics through an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a ferromagnetic insulator on one side and a current-carrying normal metal with strong spin-orbit coupling on the other. The ferromagnet is considered within the monodomain limit and we assume its coupling to the local antiferromagnet N\u00e9el order at the ferromagnet| antiferromagnet interface through exchange coupling. Coupling between the charge current and the local N\u00e9el order at the other interface is described using spin Hall phenomenology. Spin transport through the antiferromagnet, assumed to possess an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy, is solved within the adiabatic approximation and the effect of spin current flowing into the ferromagnet on its resonance linewidth is evaluated. Onsager reciprocity is used to evaluate the inverse spin Hall voltage generated across the metal by a dynamic \u2026",
                "We theoretically study a Luttinger liquid (LL) driven out of equilibrium by injection of high-energy electrons. The electrons are injected into the LL locally at a fixed energy and their spectral properties are detected at another spatial point some distance away by evaluating the average tunneling current from the LL into a resonant level with tunable energy. For energies slightly below the injection energy, the dependence of the detected current on the difference between injection, and detection energies is described by a power law whose exponent depends continuously on the Luttinger parameter. In contrast, for tunneling into a chiral LL edge of a fractional quantum-Hall state from the Laughlin sequence, we find that the detected current grows linearly with energy difference, despite a decreasing density of states.",
                "The possibility of inducing topological superconductivity with cuprate high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) is studied for various heterostructures. We first consider a ballistic planar junction between a HTSC and a metallic ferromagnet. We assume that inversion symmetry breaking at the tunnel barrier gives rise to Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the barrier and allows equal-spin triplet superconductivity to exist in the ferromagnet. Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equations are obtained by explicitly modeling the barrier and taking account of the transport anisotropy in the HTSC. By making use of the self-consistent boundary conditions and solutions for the barrier and HTSC regions, an effective equation of motion for the ferromagnet is obtained where Andreev scattering at the barrier is incorporated as a boundary condition for the ferromagnetic region. For a ferromagnet layer deposited on a (100) facet of the HTSC, triplet \u2026"
