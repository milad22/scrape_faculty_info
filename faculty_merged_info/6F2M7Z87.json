                "Single molecules of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were stretched with force-measuring laser tweezers. Under a longitudinal stress of \u223c65 piconewtons (pN), dsDNA molecules in aqueous buffer undergo a highly cooperative transition into a stable form with 5.8 angstroms rise per base pair, that is, 70% longer than B-form dsDNA. When the stress was relaxed below 65 pN, the molecules rapidly and reversibly contracted to their normal contour lengths. This transition was affected by changes in the ionic strength of the medium and the water activity or by cross-linking of the two strands of dsDNA. Individual molecules of single-stranded DNA were also stretched giving a persistence length of 7.5 angstroms and a stretch modulus of 800 pN. The overstretched form may play a significant role in the energetics of DNA recombination.",

                "Single DNA molecules were chemically attached by one end to a glass surface and by their other end to a magnetic bead. Equilibrium positions of the beads were observed in an optical microscope while the beads were acted on by known magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. Extension versus force curves were obtained for individual DNA molecules at three different salt concentrations with forces between 10(-14) and 10(-11) newtons. Deviations from the force curves predicted by the freely jointed chain model suggest that DNA has significant local curvature in solution. Ethidium bromide and 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole had little effect on the elastic response of the molecules, but their extent of intercalation was directly measured. Conversely, the effect of bend-inducing cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) was large and supports the hypothesis of natural curvature in DNA.",
                "The basic features of DNA were elucidated during the half-century following the discovery of the double helix. But it is only during the past decade that researchers have been able to manipulate single molecules of DNA to make direct measurements of its mechanical properties. These studies have illuminated the nature of interactions between DNA and proteins, the constraints within which the cellular machinery operates, and the forces created by DNA-dependent motors.",
                "Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity and developing what is known as passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at \u223c2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain\u2019s bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force \u2026",
                "Recent advances in statistical mechanical theory can be used to solve a fundamental problem in experimental thermodynamics. In 1997, Jarzynski proved an equality relating the irreversible work to the equilibrium free energy difference, \u0394G. This remarkable theoretical result states that it is possible to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters from processes carried out arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We test Jarzynski9s equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the \u0394G profile of the stretching process to withinkBT\/2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching. The implementation and test of Jarzynski9s equality provides the first example of its use as a bridge between the statistical mechanics of equilibrium and \u2026",
                "As part of the viral infection cycle, viruses must package their newly replicated genomes for delivery to other host cells. Bacteriophage \u03c629 packages its 6.6-\u00b5m long, double-stranded DNA into a 42\u00d7 54 nm capsid 1 by means of a portal complex that hydrolyses ATP 2. This process is remarkable because entropic, electrostatic and bending energies of the DNA must be overcome to package the DNA to near-crystalline density. Here we use optical tweezers to pull on single DNA molecules as they are packaged, thus demonstrating that the portal complex is a force-generating motor. This motor can work against loads of up to 57 pN on average, making it one of the strongest molecular motors reported to date. Movements of over 5 \u00b5m are observed, indicating high processivity. Pauses and slips also occur, particularly at higher forces. We establish the force\u2013velocity relationship of the motor and find that the rate-limiting \u2026",
                "Under appropriate conditions of concentration and ionic strength, ira\/w-bis (Ar-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-diphenylporphine and its copper (II) derivative produce very large, bisignate circular dichroism signals in the Soret region when bound to DNA. The processes leading to these signals are shown to be highly cooperative. A new light-scattering experimental approach is described for detecting such extended aggregates of chromophores in which the radiation used is within an absorption maximum, specifically in the porphyrin Soret absorption region. Results from such resonance light-scattering experiments confirm that extended porphyrin aggregates form on the DNA, which, in contrast, remains dispersed. A model for these interactions consistent with experimental findings involves porphyrin organization into long-range chiral structures having antenna-like properties, that is, forming assemblies in which the electric \u2026",
                "We used a force-measuring laser tweezers apparatus to determine the elastic properties of \u03bb-bacteriophage DNA as a function of ionic strength and in the presence of multivalent cations. The electrostatic contribution to the persistence length P varied as the inverse of the ionic strength in monovalent salt, as predicted by the standard worm-like polyelectrolyte model. However, ionic strength is not always the dominant variable in determining the elastic properties of DNA. Monovalent and multivalent ions have quite different effects even when present at the same ionic strength. Multivalent ions lead to P values as low as 250\u2013300 \u00c5, well below the high-salt \u201cfully neutralized\u201d value of 450\u2013500 \u00c5 characteristic of DNA in monovalent salt.

                "Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular interactions, by exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such as unfolding or dissociation. These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects\u2014features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences.

                "Carlos Bustamante Carlos Bustamante 231 Birge carlos@alice.berkeley.edu (510) 643-9706 The Bustamante Group Carlos Bustamante received his B.S. in 1973 from Universidad Peruana Cayatano Heredia; M.S. in 1975 from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos; Ph.D. in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley; Fellow of the American Physical Society since 1996; Physics Department faculty member since 1998. Named an investigator for Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2000. Fifty years ago, biochemists described cells as small vessels that contain a complex mixture of chemical species undergoing reactions through diffusion and random collision. This description was satisfactory inasmuch as the intricate pathways of metabolism and, later, the basic mechanisms of gene regulation and signal transduction were still being unraveled. Gradually, and in part as a result of the parallel growth in the structural understanding of the molecular components of the cell, together with the development of single molecule manipulation methods, scientists have become increasingly aware that the cell resembles more a mechanical factory in which many of the processes are performed by specialized machinery whose behavior is essentially mechanical in nature. Biochemical processes as diverse as the elastic response of DNA, protein-induced DNA bending, chromosomal segregation, replication, transcription, translation, protein translocation across membranes, catalyzed protein and nucleic acid folding and unfolding, and even the ubiquitous processes of induced-fit molecular recognition, are all examples in which forces and torques develop in molecules as they move along their reaction coordinates. They are thus, amenable of study by direct manipulation methods. Methods of single-molecule manipulation (such as optical tweezers or atomic force micrsocopy) are being used today to: a) measure directly the forces holding molecular structures together, b) determine the stresses and strains generated in the course of chemical and biochemical reactions, c) exert external forces or torques to alter the extent and fate of these reactions, and d) reveal the rules that govern the interconversion of mechanical and chemical forces in these processes. This area of research can be rightly called mechanochemistry. Single molecule methods are ideal to investigate the dynamics of complex reactions for, unlike their bulk counterparts, they make it possible to follow the trajectories of the individual molecules as they undergo their reactions in real-time, thus avoiding the ensemble average over the uncorrelated signals from a molecular population. We use single molecule manipulation methods to: Determine mechanical properties of macromolecules Characterize the forces that maintain and hold together the structure of proteins and RNA (folding studies); Characterize the mechanochemical energy conversion of nucleic-acid-binding molecular motors; Develop the theoretical framework for the analysis and the interpretation of single molecules data including how to extract equilibrium data from non-equilibrium measurements. Current Projects We are studying the structural basis of protein-DNA interactions and their relevance in the processes of control of gene expression using single molecule manipulation methods. In prokaryotes, and specially in eukaryotes, replication and transcription regulation involve the interaction of many specialized protein factors at regulator locations on the sequence to insure correct sequence recognition, initiation, processivity, fidelity, and kinetic control. We wish to understand the multiple structural, spatial, and functional relationships among these regulatory factors. Our laboratory is also working actively in the development of methods of single-molecule manipulation, including the use of SFM cantilevers, optical tweezers, and magnetic tweezers to investigate the mechanical properties of macromolecules. Recently, for example, we used force-measuring optical tweezers to induce complete mechanical unfolding and refolding of individual Escherichia coli ribonuclease H (RNase H) molecules. The protein unfolds in a two-state manner and refolds through an intermediate that correlates with the transient molten globule\u2013like interme- diate observed in bulk studies. This intermediate displays unusual mechanical compliance and unfolds at substantially lower forces than the native state. In a narrow range of forces, the molecule hops between the unfolded and intermediate states in real time. Occasionally, hopping was observed to stop as the molecule crossed the folding barrier directly from the intermediate, demonstrating that the intermediate is on-pathway. These studies allow us to map the energy landscape of RNase H, which represents the most complete description of the folded state of the protein. In the case of RNA, we have found conditions under which it is possible to unfold the molecules at equilibrium. In this case, it is possible to extract directly both the thermodynamics and kinetics of unfolding. Novel statistical mechanical methods are also being implemented to extract thermodynamics information from non-equilibrium data when the unfolding process does not occur reversibly. Finally, we are also studying DNA-binding molecular motors (nucleic acid translocases such as RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase, etc.) using optical tweezers to investigate the dynamics of these molecules and their mechanochemical conversion during translocation, as well as the effect of external force load and nucleotide tri-phosphate concentration on their power and force generation. A molecular motor of special interest is the bacteriophage phi 29 connector, which is responsible, together with its associated ATPase (gp16) for the packaging of the viral DNA inside the capsid during bacteriophage assembly. Our single molecule studies have revealed that this is powerful motor, capable of generating forces as high as 57 pN.
