In other words, High Energy Particle Physics. Currently my research focuses on neutrinos. Neutrinos are one tool to investigate the origin of mass and perhaps the origin of our universe. Recently some of the major puzzles in nature have been explained because neutrinos are not massless particles. Massive neutrinos oscillate from one type of neutrino to another while in flight. The NOvA project shoots a beam of neutrinos through the Earth from Fermilab to our Neutrino Laboratory in Northern Minnesota and detects the identity of the neutrinos. This long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is now being built to investigate the difference between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos by studying electron neutrino oscillations, to determine the ordering of the neutrino masses, and to make a precision measurement of the mixing between muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos. This experiment will also be able to detect neutrinos from a supernova in our galaxy. I was also involved in the experiment that discovered the last particle in the Standard Model, the tau neutrino. The first results were published in 2001. Since I teach at a University, I am also interested in the most effective way to assist students in learning Physics. In particular our Physics Education Research Group is investigating better ways to teach physics through problem solving.
