                "We propose a new higher-dimensional mechanism for solving the hierarchy problem. The weak scale is generated from the Planck scale through an exponential hierarchy. However, this exponential arises not from gauge interactions but from the background metric (which is a slice of AdS 5 spacetime). We demonstrate a simple explicit example of this mechanism with two 3-branes, one of which contains the standard model fields. The phenomenology of these models is new and dramatic. None of the current constraints on theories with very large extra dimensions apply.",
                "Conventional wisdom states that Newton's force law implies only four noncompact dimensions. We demonstrate that this is not necessarily true in the presence of a nonfactorizable background geometry. The specific example we study is a single 3-brane embedded in five dimensions. We show that even without a gap in the Kaluza-Klein spectrum, four-dimensional Newtonian and general relativistic gravity is reproduced to more than adequate precision.",
                "We show that in a general hidden sector model, supersymmetry breaking necessarily generates at one loop a scalar and gaugino mass as a consequence of the super-Weyl anomaly. We study a scenario in which this contribution dominates. We consider the Standard Model particles to be localized on a (3 + 1)-dimensional subspace or \u201c3-brane\u201d of a higher dimensional space-time, while supersymmetry breaking occurs off the 3-brane, either in the bulk or on another 3-brane. At least one extra dimension is assumed to be compactified roughly one to two orders of magnitude below the four-dimensional Planck scale. This framework is phenomenologically very attractive; it introduces new possibilities for solving the supersymmetric flavor problem, the gaugino mass problem, the supersymmetric CP problem, and the \u03bc-problem. Furthermore, the compactification scale can be consistent with a unification of gauge and \u2026",
                "Baryogenesis from the coherent production of a scalar condensate along a flat direction of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model (Aflleck-Dine mechanism) is investigated. Two important effects are emphasized. First, non-renormalizable terms in the superpotential can lift standard model flat directions at large field values. Second, the finite energy density in the early universe induces soft potentials with curvature of order the Hubble constant. Both these have important implications for baryogenesis, which requires large squark or slepton expectation values to develop along flat directions. In particular, the induced mass squared must be negative. The resulting baryon to entropy ratio is very insensitive to the details of the couplings and initial conditions, but depends on the dimension of the non-renormalizable operator in the superpotential which stabilizes the flat direction and the reheat temperature \u2026",
                "We analyze the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum model and that of compact brane models in general in the presence of a radius stabilization mechanism. We find that the expansion of our Universe is generically in agreement with the expected effective four dimensional description. The constraint (which is responsible for the appearance of nonconventional cosmologies in these models) that must be imposed on the matter densities on the two branes in the theory without a stabilized radius is a consequence of requiring a static solution even in the absence of stabilization. Such constraints disappear in the presence of a stablizing potential, and the ordinary Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations are reproduced, with the expansion driven by the sum of the physical values of the energy densities on the two branes and in the bulk. For the case of the Randall-Sundrum model we examine the kinematics of \u2026",
                "We examine various aspects of the conjectured duality between warped AdS 5 geometries with boundary branes and strongly coupled (broken) conformal field theories coupled to dynamical gravity. We also examine compactifications with 5-d gauge fields, in which case the holographic dual is a broken CFT weakly coupled to dynamical gauge fields in addition to gravity. The holographic picture is used to clarify a number of important phenomenological issues in these and related models, including the questions of black hole production, radius stabilization, early universe cosmology, and gauge coupling unification.",
                "The cosmological moduli problem is discussed in the framework of sequestered sector\/anomaly mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. In this scheme, the gravitino mass (corresponding to the moduli masses) is naturally 10\u2013100 TeV, and hence the lifetime of the moduli fields can be shorter than \u223c1 sec. As a result, the cosmological moduli fields should decay before big-bang nucleosynthesis starts. Furthermore, in the anomaly mediated scenario, the lightest superparticle (LSP) is the Wino-like neutralino. Although the large annihilation cross section means the thermal relic density of the Wino LSP is too small to be the dominant component of cold dark matter (CDM), moduli decays can produce Winos in sufficient abundance to constitute CDM. If Winos are indeed the dark matter, it will be highly advantageous from the point of view of detection. If the halo density is dominated by the Wino-like LSP, the detection \u2026",
                "Supersymmetry breaking in the early Universe induces scalar soft potentials with curvature of the order of the Hubble constant. This has a dramatic effect on the coherent production of scalar fields along flat directions. For moduli fields, this breaking generically gives a concrete realization of the moduli problem by determining the field value at early times. However, it suggests a solution if the minimum of the induced potential coincides with the true minimum. For the Affleck-Dine mechanism, large squark and slepton expectation values generally do not result if the induced soft mass squared is positive, but they do occur if it is negative. An acceptable baryon asymmetry can be obtained without subsequent entropy releases and is related to the mass of the lightest neutrino.",
                "The idea of supersymmetry at the weak scale should be tested without regard to the Planck-scale origin of any specific model. A class of low-energy effective supersymmetric theories is derived from four assumptions: minimal field content, R-parity conservation, absence of quadratic divergences, and naturalness of near-flavor conservation. Current experiments are testing and constraining this wide class of supersymmetric models, and not just a specific N= 1 supergravity model.",
                "A treatment of linearized gravity is given in the Randall-Sundrum background. The graviton propagator is found in terms of the scalar propagator, for which an explicit integral expression is provided. This reduces to the four-dimensional propagator at long distances along the brane, and provides estimates of subleading corrections. Asymptotics of the propagator off the brane yields exponential falloff of gravitational fields due to matter on the brane. This implies that black holes bound to the brane have a``pancake''-like shape in the extra dimension, and indicates validity of a perturbative treatment off the brane. Some connections with the AdS\/CFT correspondence are described."
