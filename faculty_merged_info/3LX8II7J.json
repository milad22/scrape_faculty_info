Inflation, Dark matter and Dark Energy. String Phenomenology. String theory as a quantum theory of gravity. Prof. Watson's research focuses on the connection between fundamental particle physics and cosmology with an emphasis on physics beyond the Standard Model. These investigations lead to testable predictions which make it tractable to probe the earliest moments of the universe and properties of fundamental theories, such as string theory.
