                "A fully interacting effective chiral Lagrangian obeying the anomalous axial-baryon-current conservation law is constructed. This Lagrangian is a generalization of one implied by the 1 N approximation. In a certain sense, the old \u03c3 model is recovered. Our Lagrangian displays the dependence of amplitudes on the quantum-chromodynamic vacuum angle \u03b8, gives soft \u03b7\u2032 theorems, and hints at a possible complementarity between the instanton and 1 N approaches. We can rewrite our model in terms of a gauge-invariant gluon field.",
                "A review is given of developments between 1973 and 1977 that have added the concept of order to general S-matrix principles with the aim of constructing a bootstrap theory of hadrons.",
                "A mechanism is exhibited that monotonically depresses the cylinder component of the topological expansion with increasing t, and it is conjectured that all non-planar S-matrix components diminish as t increases, exchange degeneracy and the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule becoming more accurately satisfied. Such asymptotic planarity is compared to the field-theoretical concept of asymptotic freedom. The characteristics low-t cylinder \u201cquenching interval\u201d is found to be the inverse of the mean value over a two-reggeon loop, of 1 2 \u03c0 2 (\u03b1\u2032) 2 (t 1\u2212 t 2) 2\/(\u2212 t), where t 1 and t 2 are the squared masses of the loop reggeons and \u03b1\u2032 is the trajectory slope. For leading trajectories the low-t cylinder quenching interval is predicted by this formula to be roughly 0.5 GeV 2-consistent with the observed pomeron intercept and slope, with the p-\u03c9 and fA 2 mass differences and with the (\u03c6, \u03c9) deviation from ideal mixing. As t grows \u2026",
                "I suggest that the structure observed between s= 3.9 and 4.5 GeV at SPEAR is due to the presence of exotic mesons composed of a charmed diquark and antidiquark. Arguments for the existence of such mesons are reviewed. The characteristic features, ie, masses, narrow widths, and abundance, which enable them to explain the data are presented. Further properties and yet another narrow meson with m\u2248 6.7 GeV\/c 2 is predicted.",
                "The cylinder correction to the planar S matrix splits I = 0 from I = 1, lifts exchange degeneracy of I = 0 states and induces deviations from ideal mixing. All three effects are approximately described by one parameter which gives the shift of the \u03c9 intercept below the \u03f1, the couplings of f, f\u2032, \u03c9, \u0444, the shift of the f above the \u03f1, and its tendency to become an SU3 singlet heretofore labeled at t = 0 as the pomeron."
