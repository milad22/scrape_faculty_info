                "Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the solar wind is observed to show the spectral behavior of classical Kolmogorov fluid turbulence over an inertial subrange and departures from this at short wavelengths, where energy should be dissipated. Here we present the first measurements of the electric field fluctuation spectrum over the inertial and dissipative wave number ranges in a \u03b2\u2273 1 plasma. The k\u2212 5\/3 inertial subrange is observed and agrees strikingly with the magnetic fluctuation spectrum; the wave phase speed in this regime is shown to be consistent with the Alfv\u00e9n speed. At smaller wavelengths k \u03c1 i\u2265 1 the electric spectrum is enhanced and is consistent with the expected dispersion relation of short-wavelength kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves. Kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves damp on the solar wind ions and electrons and may act to isotropize them. This effect may explain the fluidlike nature of the solar wind.",
                "Solar Probe Plus (SPP) will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona. SPP\u2019s main science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun\u2019s coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Understanding these fundamental phenomena has been a top-priority science goal for over five decades, dating back to the 1958 Simpson Committee Report. The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The mission design and the technology and engineering developments enable SPP to meet its science objectives to: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the \u2026",
                "The proton temperature anisotropy in the solar wind is known to be constrained by the theoretical thresholds for pressure-anisotropy-driven instabilities. Here, we use approximately 1\u00d7 10 6 independent measurements of gyroscale magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind to show for the first time that these fluctuations are enhanced along the temperature anisotropy thresholds of the mirror, proton oblique firehose, and ion cyclotron instabilities. In addition, the measured magnetic compressibility is enhanced at high plasma beta (\u03b2\u2225\u2273 1) along the mirror instability threshold but small elsewhere, consistent with expectations of the mirror mode. We also show that the short wavelength magnetic fluctuation power is a strong function of collisionality, which relaxes the temperature anisotropy away from the instability conditions and reduces correspondingly the fluctuation power.",
                "On 1 April 2001, the Polar satellite crossed a subsolar magnetopause associated with antiparallel magnetic fields. Over a width\u223c 6 magnetosheath ion skin depths (\u223c 3 magnetospheric ion skin depths), perpendicular ion flows different from E\u00d7 B\/B 2 as well as Hall magnetic and electric field signatures were observed. At a smaller scale, the electron flow decoupled from the magnetic field near a deep minimum in the magnetic field strength. Separatrices were identified as boundaries of low frequency electric field turbulence associated with density minima and parallel electric fields. The reconnection rate was less than 2% of the asymptotic Alfv\u00e9n speed.",
                "The Electric Fields and Waves (EFW) Instruments on the two Radiation Belt Storm Probe (RBSP) spacecraft (recently renamed the Van Allen Probes) are designed to measure three dimensional quasi-static and low frequency electric fields and waves associated with the major mechanisms responsible for the acceleration of energetic charged particles in the inner magnetosphere of the Earth. For this measurement, the instrument uses two pairs of spherical double probe sensors at the ends of orthogonal centripetally deployed booms in the spin plane with tip-to-tip separations of 100 meters. The third component of the electric field is measured by two spherical sensors separated by \u223c15 m, deployed at the ends of two stacer booms oppositely directed along the spin axis of the spacecraft. The instrument provides a continuous stream of measurements over the entire orbit of the low frequency electric field vector \u2026",
                "We report direct measurements of high-energy particles in a rare crossing of the diffusion region in Earth\u2019s magnetotail by the Wind spacecraft. The fluxes of energetic electrons up to\u223c 300 k e V peak near the center of the diffusion region and decrease monotonically away from this region. The diffusion region electron flux spectrum obeys a power law with an index of\u2212 3.8 above\u223c 2 k e V, and the electron angular distribution displays strong field-aligned bidirectional anisotropy at energies below\u223c 2 k e V, becoming isotropic above\u223c 6 k e V. These observations indicate significant electron acceleration inside the diffusion region. Ions show no such energization.",
                "This paper introduces and describes the radio and plasma wave investigation on the STEREO Mission: STEREO\/WAVES or S\/WAVES. The S\/WAVES instrument includes a suite of state-of-the-art experiments that provide comprehensive measurements of the three components of the fluctuating electric field from a fraction of a hertz up to 16 MHz, plus a single frequency channel near 30 MHz. The instrument has a direction finding or goniopolarimetry capability to perform 3D localization and tracking of radio emissions associated with streams of energetic electrons and shock waves associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The scientific objectives include: (i) remote observation and measurement of radio waves excited by energetic particles throughout the 3D heliosphere that are associated with the CMEs and with solar flare phenomena, and (ii) in-situ measurement of the properties of CMEs and \u2026",
                "We present observations of intense, bipolar, electrostatic structures in the transition region of the terrestrial bow shock from the Wind spacecraft. The electric field signatures are on the order of a tenth of a millisecond in duration and greater than 100 mV\/m in amplitude. The measured electric field is generally larger on the smaller dipole antenna, indicating a small spatial size. We compare the potential on the two dipole antennas with a model of antenna response to a Gaussian potential profile. This result agrees with a spatial scale determined by convection and gives a characteristic scale size of 2\u20137 \u03bbd. We interpret the observations as small scale convecting unipolar potential structures, consistent with simulations of electron phase space holes and discuss the results in the context of electron thermalization at strong collisionless shocks.",
                "The nature of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind is investigated using a comparison of Cluster magnetic and electric field measurements to predictions arising from models consisting of either kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves or whistler waves. The electric and magnetic field properties of these waves from linear theory are used to construct spacecraft-frame frequency spectra of (| \u03b4E|\/| \u03b4B|) s\/c and (| \u03b4B\u2225|\/| \u03b4B|) s\/c, allowing for a direct comparison to spacecraft data. The measured properties of the small-scale turbulent fluctuations, found to be inconsistent with the whistler wave model, agree well with the prediction of a spectrum of kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves with nearly perpendicular wavevectors.",
                " The IMPACT (In situ Measurements of Particles And CME Transients) investigation on the STEREO mission was designed and developed to provide multipoint solar wind and suprathermal electron, interplanetary magnetic field, and solar energetic particle information required to unravel the nature of coronal mass ejections and their heliospheric consequences. IMPACT consists of seven individual sensors which are packaged into a boom suite, and a SEP suite. This review summarizes the science objectives of IMPACT, the instruments that comprise the IMPACT investigation, the accommodation of IMPACT on the STEREO twin spacecraft, and the overall data products that will flow from the IMPACT measurements. Accompanying papers in this volume of Space Science Reviews highlight the individual sensor technical details and capabilities, STEREO project plans for the use of IMPACT data, and \u2026"

Bale received B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Minnesota in 1989 and 1994, respectively. After three years of postdoctoral work at Queen Mary College, University of London, he came to a research position at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) at Berkeley. He joined the Physics faculty in 2004 and is the Director of SSL. He has held visiting appointments at the Observatoire de Paris, Meudon (Univ. Paris VII), LPCE\/CNRS in Orleans, France, and the University of Sydney. He is a recipient of the 2003 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). I am interested in plasma astrophysics from the experimental point of view. Much of the universe is in the plasma state and we are just coming to appreciate the role of plasma dynamics and magnetic fields in the large-scale evolution of astrophysical systems. However, many of the fundamental processes are poorly understood and can only be studied in a limited parameter regime in the laboratory. Examples are magnetic reconnection, collisionless shocks, plasma turbulence, and solar\/stellar wind generation and evolution. My research is focused on developing experiments to understand these processes and, in particular, how microscale, kinetic phenomena, affect large-scale plasma evolution. I am also interested in low frequency (LF) radio astronomy, at frequencies below the ionospheric cutoff (~12 MHz); these observations need to be made from space. Signatures of solar flare electrons and CMEs dominate the dynamics at these frequencies, however the large-scale structure of the radio sky below 15 MHz remains mostly unexplored. Our group at the Space Sciences Laboratory develops, builds, and operates space-borne experiments to study in situ the plasma processes active in astrophysical, heliospheric, and magnetospheric systems. These experiments are flown on NASA and ESA spacecraft missions and are often developed as balloon and sounding rocket payloads. Current Projects My group is involved with NASA\u2019s STEREO mission to study the generation and evolution of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) phenomena. CMEs are dramatic, large-scale solar eruptions whose triggering mechanism, evolution, and role in solar physics are largely unknown; however CMEs are thought to play a role in the helicity evolution of the solar dynamo. Several of the experiments on STEREO were designed and built at the Space Sciences Lab. Our experiments will remotely sense radio emission and energetic particles from these events, as well as thermalization and shock processes in the ambient solar wind. Opportunities exist for students to be involved in data analysis on STEREO. Magnetic reconnection is a phenomenon that allows rapid, topological reorganization of magnetic fields in a plasma; it is the primary agent in solar flare and magnetospheric dynamics and is thought to play a role in solar\/stellar wind acceleration, accretion disk physics, and other astrophysical phenomena. Our experiments on the Polar, Wind, and Cluster spacecraft have made important measurements of ion and electron diffusion and plasma turbulence related to reconnection evolution. Experimental studies of electron diffusion and wave physics are continuing. An ongoing project is the study of electric fields, wave phenomena, and particle acceleration at collisionless shocks. Shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysics and are responsible for particle (cosmic ray) acceleration, plasma heating, and mediating flow at astrophysical boundaries. Dissipation physics, particle acceleration, and the energy budget at shocks are poorly understood. Experiments on the Cluster, Wind, and Polar spacecraft are used to study these problems. Other important problems currently accessible to experimental progress include solar wind generation and evolution, plasma radio emission mechanisms, and plasma wave-particle interactions.
