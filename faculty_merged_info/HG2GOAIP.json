                "Emerging economies are low-income, rapid-growth countries using economic liberalization as their primary engine of growth. They fall into two groups: developing countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East and transition economies in the former Soviet Union and China. Private and public enterprises have had to develop unique strategies to cope with the broad scope and rapidity of economic and political change in emerging economies. This Special Research Forum on Emerging Economies examines strategy formulation and implementation by private and public enterprises in several different regional settings and from three primary theoretical perspectives: institutional theory, transaction cost economics, and the resource-based view of the firm. In this introduction, we show how different theoretical perspectives can provide useful insights into enterprise strategies in emerging economies. We \u2026",

                "The resource-based view can be positioned relative to at least three theoretical traditions: SCP-based theories of industry determinants of firm performance, neo-classical microeconomics, and evolutionary economics. In the 1991 article, only the first of these ways of positioning the resourcebased view is explored. This article briefly discusses some of the implications of positioning the resource-based view relative to these other two literatures; it also discusses some of the empirical implications of each of these different resource-based theories.",
                "Theory suggests and results show that firm performance is initially positive but eventually levels off and becomes negative as international diversification increases. Product diversification moderates the relationship between international diversification and performance. International diversification is negatively related to performance in nondiversified firms, positively related in highly product-diversified firms, and curvilinearly related in moderately product-diversified firms. International diversification is also positively related to R&D intensity, but the interaction effects with product diversification are negative. The results of this study provide evidence of the importance of international diversification for competitive advantage but also suggest the complexities of implementing it to achieve these advantages in product-diversified firms.",

                " This review and introduction to the Special Issue on \u2018Strategy Research in Emerging Economies\u2019 considers the nature of theoretical contributions thus far on strategy in emerging economies. We classify the research through four strategic options: (1) firms from developed economies entering emerging economies; (2) domestic firms competing within emerging economies; (3) firms from emerging economies entering other emerging economies; and (4) firms from emerging economies entering developed economies. Among the four perspectives examined (institutional theory, transaction cost theory, resource\u2010based theory, and agency theory), the most dominant seems to be institutional theory. Most existing studies that make a contribution blend institutional theory with one of the other three perspectives, including seven out of the eight papers included in this Special Issue. We suggest a future research agenda based \u2026",
                "Boards of directors of large corporations provide a governance safeguard to both equity capital and managerial employment contracts. Thus, the board is a potentially important instrument of internal control. This article develops theory and propositions concerning (a) the relation among ownership, managerial control, and the composition of the boards of directors; (b) the relation between the composition of the boards and control strategies (strategic versus financial controls); and (c) the relation among choice of control, corporate strategy, and strategic choice.",
                "The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field\u2019s early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler\u2019s (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff\u2019s (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics \u2026",
                "This research examines an integrated theoretical model that explains how strategies for participating in the market for corporate control (acquisitions and divestitures) affect internal control mechanisms and, together, influence internal and external innovation. Nine out of ten hypotheses received support, with results showing that firms engaging in acquisitions and divestitures emphasize financial controls, deemphasize strategic controls, and thereby produce less internal innovation. Furthermore, these firms are likely to seek external innovation to gain short-term benefits in competitive advantage. We conclude that engaging in the market for corporate control strongly affects the context in which innovation is framed, the control mechanisms employed, and the design and process of innovation.",
                "Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners."
