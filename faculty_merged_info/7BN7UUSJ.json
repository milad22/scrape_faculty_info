                "We present a systematic investigation of the distribution of normal forces at the boundaries of static packings of spheres. A method for the efficient construction of large hexagonal-close-packed crystals is introduced and used to study the effect of spatial ordering on the distribution of forces. Under uniaxial compression we find that the form for the probability distribution of normal forces between particles does not depend strongly on crystallinity or interparticle friction. In all cases the distribution decays exponentially at large forces and shows a plateau or possibly a small peak near the average force but does not tend to zero at small forces.",
                "We investigate clogging of microchannels at the single-pore level using microfluidic devices as model porous media. The process of clogging is studied at low volume fractions and high flow rates, a technologically important regime. We show that clogging is independent of particle flow rate and volume fraction, indicating that collective effects do not play an important role. Instead, the average number of particles that can pass through a pore before it clogs scales with the ratio of pore to particle size. We present a simple model that accounts for the data.",
                "We measure the geometry of a crumpled sheet of paper with laser-aided topography and discuss its statistical properties. The curvature of an elastoplastic fold scales linearly with applied force. The curvature distribution follows an exponential form with regions of high curvature localized along ridges. The measured ridge length distribution is consistent with a hierarchical model for ridge breaking during crumpling. A large fraction of the ridges are observed to terminate without bifurcating, and the ridge network connectedness is not as complete as anticipated. The self-affinity of the surface is characterized by a Hurst exponent of 0.71\u00b10.01 in contrast with previous results.",
                "We report the experimental observation of vortex patterns in vertically vibrated granular rods. Above a critical packing fraction, moving ordered domains of nearly vertical rods spontaneously form and coexist with horizontal rods. The domains of vertical rods coarsen in time to form large vortices. We investigate the conditions under which the vortices occur by varying the number of rods, vibration amplitude, and frequency. The size of the vortices increases with the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by measuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A void-filling model is presented to describe the nucleation and growth of the vertical domains. We track the ends of the vertical rods and obtain the velocity fields of the vortices. The rotation speed of the rods is observed to depend on the vibration velocity of the container and on the packing. To investigate the impact \u2026"

Soft matter or soft materials physics is a young subfield of condensed matter physics that has it\u2019s roots in polymer science. Specifically, his group is working to understand the link between the microstructure of disordered materials and their bulk mechanical properties. To accomplish this, his group is performing experiments in which they deform and measure stress propagation in soft disordered solids such as colloidal glasses, gels, and foams. The glasses we construct are surprisingly similar to their atomic counterparts, but have length and size scales that allow for direct real time information to be acquired using advanced microscopy techniques. Professor Daniel Blair received his PhD in Physics from Clark University after obtaining a SM from the University of Chicago. Prior to his graduate work professor Blair spent over a year as a research student at Argonne National Laboratory in the Material Science Division. After receiving his PhD in 2004, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Department of Physics at Harvard University with David Weitz. Professor Blair received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in 2009. Professor Blair spent his sabbatical (2015-2016) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At NIH, Prof. Blair spent his time at within\u00a0the National Heart Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI) in the group of Dr. Clare Waterman investigating the influence of topology (2D vs 3D)\u00a0and stiffness gradients on cellular mophodynamics. \u00a0At NIST, Prof. Blair split his time between the Materials Science and Engineering division within the Materials Measurement Laboratory (MML) and at the Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) providing expertise in the development of a micro-RHEO-SANS instrument. Soft Glassy Solids The Blairlab is interested understanding the structural behavior of disordered solids. Glassy materials\u00a0are found nearly everywhere in nature and industry. Many soft materials, such as colloidal dispersions, exhibit behavior indicative of the glass transition. In fact, colloidal glasses exhibit many of the hallmarks associated with glasses, such as aging and heterogeneous dynamics. In the Blairlab we utilize tools such as confocal microscopy and rheology (bulk and micro) to investigate the micromechanical structure and properties of soft glassy solids. Specifically, we investigate the spatial distribution of forces inside colloidal emulsions under shear stress. By compressing the emulsion drops, we can pick out the contact forces directly and measure how the spatial structure of those forces is changed under the application of shear. This work will provide unprecedented information into the way structurally disordered solids undergo mechanical failure. We are also using thermally sensitive hydrogel particles to understand the onset of glassy behavior in colloidal glasses. Our contention is that the mechanical properties of the glass must be determined through the interplay between the microstructure and the particle level dynamics as the transition is crossed. To investigate these ideas, we utilize three dimensional confocal microscopy linked with bulk rheology to investigate the glassy dynamics and heterogeneous particle restructuring events under external shear. This system will allow us to de\ufb01nitively quantify how the inherent glassy structure affects the rheological properties of amorphous solids. Biopolymer Networks Professor Blair is currently using these methods to investigate how biologically derived polymeric systems . The goal of this work is to build up our knowledge of how networks of branched and cross-linked biopolymers distribute globally and locally applied strains. This will assist in understanding the varied morphologies found in cells and tissues that interact with the extracellular matrix. Current Teaching Fall\u00a02016: PHYS-509 (Grad.
