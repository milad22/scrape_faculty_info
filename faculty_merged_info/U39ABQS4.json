                "Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene VHL cause oversecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by clear-cell renal carcinomas. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate bevacizumab, a neutralizing antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, in patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.A randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial was conducted comparing placebo with bevacizumab at doses of 3 and 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, given every two weeks; the time to progression of disease and the response rate were primary end points. Crossover from placebo to antibody treatment was allowed, and survival was a secondary end point.Minimal toxic effects were seen, with hypertension and asymptomatic proteinuria predominating. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis met the criteria for early stopping. With 116 patients randomly assigned to treatment \u2026",
                "Through the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes after host immunodepletion, it is possible to mediate objective cancer regression in human patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the generation of tumor-specific T cells in this mode of immunotherapy is often limiting. Here we report the ability to specifically confer tumor recognition by autologous lymphocytes from peripheral blood by using a retrovirus that encodes a T cell receptor. Adoptive transfer of these transduced cells in 15 patients resulted in durable engraftment at levels exceeding 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes for at least 2 months after the infusion. We observed high sustained levels of circulating, engineered cells at 1 year after infusion in two patients who both demonstrated objective regression of metastatic melanoma lesions. This study suggests the therapeutic potential of genetically engineered cells for the biologic therapy of cancer.",
                "Obesity is globally prevalent and highly heritable, but its underlying genetic factors remain largely elusive. To identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and\u223c 2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (P< 5\u00d7 10\u2212 8), one of which includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation.",
                "Lymphocytes extracted from freshly resected melanomas can be expanded in vitro and can often mediate specific lysis of autologous tumor cells but not allogeneic tumor or autologous normal cells. We treated 20 patients with metastatic melanoma by means of adoptive transfer of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2, after the patients had received a single intravenous dose of cyclophosphamide. Objective regression of the cancer was observed in 9 of 15 patients (60 percent) who had not previously been treated with interleukin-2 and in 2 of 5 patients (40 percent) in whom previous therapy with interleukin-2 had failed. Regression of cancer occurred in the lungs, liver, bone, skin, and subcutaneous sites and lasted from 2 to more than 13 months. Toxic effects of interleukin-2 occurred, although the treatment course was short (five days); these side effects were reversible.It appears that in patients \u2026",
                "First-line therapy for advanced non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that lacks targetable mutations is platinum-based chemotherapy. Among patients with a tumor proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of choice. The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher rates of response and longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone in a phase 2 trial.In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who had received no previous treatment for metastatic disease to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or \u2026",
                "Application of the experimental design of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is now 10 years old (young), and here we review the remarkable range of discoveries it has facilitated in population and complex-trait genetics, the biology of diseases, and translation toward new therapeutics. We predict the likely discoveries in the next 10 years, when GWASs will be based on millions of samples with array data imputed to a large fully sequenced reference panel and on hundreds of thousands of samples with whole-genome sequencing data.",
                "Tomotherapy, literally \u201cslice therapy,\u201d is a proposal for the delivery of radiation therapy with intensity\u2010modulated strips of radiation. The proposed method employs a linear accelerator, or another radiation\u2010emitting device, which would be mounted on a ring gantry like a CT scanner. The patient would move through the bore of the gantry simultaneously with gantry rotation. The intensity modulation would be performed by temporally modulated multiple independent leaves that open and close across the slit opening. At any given time, any leaf would be (1) closed, covering a portion of the slit, (2) open, allowing radiation through, or (3) changing between these states. This method would result in the delivery of highly conformal radiation. Overall treatment times should be comparable with contemporary treatment delivery times. The ring gantry would make it convenient to mount a narrow multisegmented megavoltage \u2026",
                "We have administered 1039 courses of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) to 652 cancer patients. Five hundred ninety-six patients had metastatic cancer that either had failed standard effective therapies or had disease for which no standard effective therapy existed, and 56 patients were treated in the absence of evaluable disease in the adjuvant setting. IL-2 was administered either alone (155 patients) or in conjunction with activated immune cells such as lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells (214 patients) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)(66 patients), with other cytokines such as alpha interferon (a-IFN)(128 patients) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)(38 patients), with monoclonal antibodies (32 patients), or with the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (19 patients). Initial results with the treatment of high-dose IL-2 alone or in conjunction with LAK cells have indicated that objective regressions of cancer can \u2026",
                " Background: Studies of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) derived from patients with a variety of histologic types of cancer have demonstrated that cellular immune reactions against established malignancy exist in humans. Purpose: We report the results of using autologous TILs plus high-dose bolus interleukin 2 (IL-2), with or without the concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide, in the treatment of 86 consecutive patients with metastatic melanoma. Methods: From May 1987 through December 1992, 86 patients (38 female and 48 male) with metastatic melanoma were treated (145 courses) with autologous TILs plus high-dose intravenous bolus IL-2 (720 000 IU\/kg every 8 hours). TILs plus IL-2 were administered in two cycles separated by approximately 2 weeks. Two treatment cycles constituted one treatment course. Patients received a maximum of 15 doses of IL-2 per cycle given every \u2026"
