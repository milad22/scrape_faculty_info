                "Stephon Alexander Theory Lab Contact More The Alexander group explores the interconnection between the smallest and largest entities in the cosmos by using experimental data in cosmology and particle physics to test, constrain and improve on theories of quantum gravity and beyond the standard model of cosmology and particle physics. \u00a0Some questions we investigate are: \u200b What happened at and before the big bang singularity? What is the identity and nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why does vacuum energy not gravitate (the cosmological constant problem)? What is the origin of matter over anti-matter in the universe? Can we use gravitational wave physics to probe fundamental physics? What is the origin of large scale structure in the universe? PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR STEPHON ALEXANDER stephon_alexander [at] brown.edu Stephon Alexander is a Professor of Physics at Brown University and the President of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP). Alexander has had previous appointments at Stanford University, Imperial College, Penn State, Dartmouth College, and Haverford College. He is a specialist in the field of string cosmology, where the physics of superstrings are applied to address longstanding questions in cosmology. In 2001, he co-invented the model of inflation based on higher dimensional hypersurfaces in string theory called D-Branes. In such models, the early universe emerged from the destruction of a higher dimensional D-brane which ignites a period of rapid expansion of space often referred to as cosmic inflation. POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHERS STEVEN J CLARK steven_j_clark\u00a0[at] brown.edu Steven J Clark\u00a0is a\u00a0Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Physics at Brown University.\u00a0His research interests span a wide range of topics in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Particularly, he is interested in how these different areas interact with each other. His most recent work has focused on cosmological signatures of dark matter GABRIEL HERCZEG gabriel_herczeg [at] brown.edu Gabriel Herczeg is a\u00a0Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Physics at Brown University. His research interests span a range topics, including the study of exact solutions of general relativity and modified theories of gravity, related areas of mathematical physics, and applications of differential geometry to quantum theory. Most recently, he has\u00a0focused on the cosmological implications of some modified theories of gravity inspired by topological field theory. GRADUATE STUDENTS TATSUYA DANIEL tatsuya_daniel [at] brown.edu Tatsuya Daniel is a first year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Brown University with an interest in Astro-Cosmo theory. He just completed his undergraduate studies at MIT.
