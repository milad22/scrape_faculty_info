                "Jorge Jose Leite Noronha, Jr Associate Professor 437B Loomis Laboratory (217) 244-3541 (217) 333-1215 jn0508@illinois.edu Professor Jorge Noronha received his bachelors degree in Physics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil, in 2003. After completing his M.Sc. in 2004 at the Brazilian Center for Physical Research (CBPF), he went on to obtain his Ph.D. in Physics from the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, in 2007. His Ph.D. thesis helped determine the properties of the ultradense matter present in the core of neutron stars in the presence of strong magnetic fields. Jorge was a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University in New York from 2008-2011 where he focused on the applications of string theory techniques (holographic correspondence) to investigate the dynamical properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. From 2011-2019 Jorge was a faculty member at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, where he developed novel techniques to describe out-of-equilibrium phenomena in relativistic systems under extreme conditions. Jorge joined the Physics Department at UIUC in August 2019. Research Interests Quantum chromodynamics at finite temperature and density (heavy ion collisions, neutron stars). Relativistic fluid dynamics and kinetic theory. Holographic duality and its applications in strongly coupled gauge theories. My research establishes connections between string theory, relativistic fluid dynamics, and kinetic theory to tackle outstanding problems in high energy nuclear theory that are beyond the reach of current first principles techniques. A prime example of this is the fluid-like behavior displayed by the quark-gluon plasma, an exotic phase of quantum chromodynamics that existed microseconds after the Big Bang in which quarks and gluons were not confined inside protons and neutrons. Tiny specks of this early Universe matter are now being copiously produced in heavy ion collision experiments, which have provided overwhelming evidence that the quark-gluon plasma flows like a nearly frictionless strongly coupled liquid over distance scales not much larger than the size of a proton. This makes the quark-gluon plasma formed in colliders the hottest, smallest, densest, most perfect fluid known to humanity. How such fluid dynamical behavior emerges from the fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics is one of the open problems that I want to shed light on through my research. I'm also interested in the novel properties displayed by viscous fluids in general relativity and their applications in neutron star mergers and cosmology.

Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe tackles big questions What is the true nature of dark matter? What is dark energy? Why is the expansion of the universe accelerating? Why is there way more matter than antimatter in the universe? And is Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity correct even under the most extreme conditions in the universe? These big fundamental questions have yet to be answered. According to Nicolas Yunes, founding director of the new Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe (ICASU) housed in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, scientists are making great strides in our understanding of the fundamental nature of our universe by collaborating across scientific disciplines. \u201cOur scientific understanding of the universe is at a tipping point, thanks to recent observations and to new computational and mathematical models for understanding these observations,\u201d comments Yunes. \u201cThe level of complexity, however, is such that a compartmentalized approach to science is useful no longer, and only through collaboration can we shed new light on the nature of the universe.\u201d Faculty Highlights Spotlight on new faculty: Jorge Jose Leite Noronha, Nuclear Physics Jorge Noronha\u00a0is a nuclear\u00a0theorist whose primary interest is in the out-of-equilibrium behavior of relativistic systems under extreme conditions."
