                "Shuichi  Kunori Research Professor Shuichi.Kunori@ttu.edu (806) 834-8797 013 Science Building Particle Physics: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics was developed in 1960s and 1970s and predicted\n                     heavy quarks (c, b, t), tau neutrino, gluon, W\/Z bosons and Higgs bosons. The early\n                     confirmations of the prediction came in 1973 and 1974 as the discoveries of neutral\n                     current and J\/psi (a bound state of charm quark and anti-charm quark). My research\n                     started with searches for charmed particles in bubble chamber pictures and I published\n                     my first paper on charmed baryon production via neutrino charged current interactions\n                     in 1980 (PhD thesis). I continued studies the Standard Model physics in 1980s and\n                     1990s using neutrino beams, muon beams and antiproton-proton collisions. The searches\n                     for the SM particles were concluded with the discovery of Higgs particle at the LHC\n                     in 2012. Although the Standard Model is beautiful and very successful theoretical model, its\n                     short coming was recognized very early days. The development of Supersymmetry (SUSY)\n                     started in late 1960s and the first realistic model was proposed in 1978. SUSY is\n                     an extension of the Standard Model to solve \"hierarchy problem\". I worked for a proposal\n                     for a new antiproton-proton collision experiment \u00a0(D0) in 1983 and started searches\n                     for SUSY. \u00a0The signature of SUSY was Jet(s)+MET (missing transverse energy). More\n                     recent models, e.g. Extra Dimensions, Unparticles and Dark Matter, also produce similar\n                     signature. Since the D0 time, I worked on the design of detectors and data analysis\n                     techniques to improve the search for SUSY and other new physics in hadron collider\n                     experiments. My resent data analysis using the Jets+MET did not yet show any evidence\n                     of new physics in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. I have extended my search using\n                     other signatures and plan to use more data to find the evidence of new new physics\n                     beyond the Standard Model at the LHC in\u00a0coming years. Detector Design and Development: It is always fun to design new experiment. I was involved in the designing of detectors\n                     for several experiments. A large detector consists of several sub-detectors. I worked\n                     on a particular sub-detector, e.g. calorimeter or muon detector in each experiment.\n                     In addition, I developed the detector simulation software for those experiments. With\n                     the simulation, \u00a0I had opportunities to evaluate the performance of the whole detector\n                     and optimized the detector design with collaborators. Now, I am thinking about a detector\n                     for future colliders. Future collider experiments require radiation hard and fast detector components. I\n                     am currently working on R&D of radiation hard scintillation wave-length-shift fibers\n                     and fast silicon sensors for future detectors.
