Theoretical atomic physics, in particular three-body (Coulomb) problems; low- and high-energy positron collisions; electron collisions; photodetachment of negative ions; variational principles; modified effective range theories; formulation of atomic theory. Dr. Sandra Quintanilla is an atomic theorist who studies various aspects of the three body Coulomb problem. In particular she studies positron collision, (E-2e) collisions, and Photon interactions. Positron collisions have important applications in many areas of physics such as solid state and astrophysics. UNT Faculty Profile"
