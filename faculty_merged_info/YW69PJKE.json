                "Alternative modes of metabolism enable cells to resist metabolic stress. Inhibiting these compensatory pathways may produce synthetic lethality. We previously demonstrated that glucose deprivation stimulated a pathway in which acetyl-CoA was formed from glutamine downstream of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Here we show that import of pyruvate into the mitochondria suppresses GDH and glutamine-dependent acetyl-CoA formation. Inhibiting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) activates GDH and reroutes glutamine metabolism to generate both oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, enabling persistent tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function. Pharmacological blockade of GDH elicited largely cytostatic effects in culture, but these effects became cytotoxic when combined with MPC inhibition. Concomitant administration of MPC and GDH inhibitors significantly impaired tumor growth compared to either inhibitor \u2026",
                "The electrical conductivities (\u03c3) of nanocomposites of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) have been studied for a large number of nanocomposites prepared in a SWCNT concentration range between 0.02 and 8 wt%. The values of \u03c3 obey a percolation power law with an SWCNT concentration threshold, pc = 0.13 wt%, the lowest yet obtained for any kind of carbon\u2013polyethylene nanocomposites. Improved electrical conductivities attest to an effective dispersion of SWCNT in the polyethylene matrix, enabled by the fast quenching crystallization process used in the preparation of these nanocomposites. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy consistently points to a uniform dispersion of separate small SWCNT bundles at concentrations near pc and increased nanotube clustering at higher concentrations. Near pc, high \u2026",
                "Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate has become an important diagnostic tracer of normal and aberrant cellular metabolism for in vitro and in vivo NMR spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MRI). In pursuit of achieving high NMR signal enhancements in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments, we have performed an extensive investigation of the influence of Gd3+ doping, a parameter previously reported to improve hyperpolarized NMR signals, on the DNP of this compound. [1-13C]Pyruvate samples were doped with varying amounts of Gd3+ and fixed optimal concentrations of free radical polarizing agents commonly used in fast dissolution DNP: trityl OX063 (15 mM), 4-oxo-TEMPO (40 mM), and BDPA (40 mM). In general, we have observed three regions of interest, namely, (i) a monotonic increase in DNP-enhanced nuclear polarization Pdnp upon increasing the Gd3+ concentration until a certain threshold \u2026",
                "Hyperpolarized 89Y complexes are attractive NMR spectroscopy and MR imaging probes due to the exceptionally long spin\u2013lattice relaxation time (T1 \u2248 10 min) of the 89Y nucleus. However, in vivo imaging of 89Y has not yet been realized because of the low NMR signal enhancement levels previously achieved for this ultra low-\u03b3n nucleus. Here, we report liquid-state 89Y NMR signal enhancements over 60\u2009000 times the thermal signal at 298 K in a 9.4 T magnet, achieved after the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of Y(III) complex of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) samples at 3.35 T and 1.4 K. The 89Y DNP was shown to proceed by thermal mixing and the liquid state 89Y NMR signal enhancement was maximized by (i) establishing the optimal microwave irradiation frequency, (ii) optimizing the glassing matrix, (iii) choosing a radical with negligible inhomogeneous line \u2026",
                "Highly sensitive MR imaging agents that can accurately and rapidly monitor changes in pH would have diagnostic and prognostic value for many diseases. Here, we report an investigation of hyperpolarized 15 N-pyridine derivatives as ultrasensitive pH-sensitive imaging probes. These molecules are easily polarized to high levels using standard dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) techniques and their 15 N chemical shifts were found to be highly sensitive to pH. These probes displayed sharp 15 N resonances and large differences in chemical shifts (\u0394\u03b4> 90 ppm) between their free base and protonated forms. These favorable features make these agents highly suitable candidates for the detection of small changes in tissue pH near physiological values.",
                "Teaching an old free radical new tricks: The stable free radical 1, 3\u2010bisdiphenylene\u20102\u2010phenylallyl (BDPA) is an efficient polarizing agent in the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of a variety of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, such as tetramethylallene or [15 N] choline (see figure). In addition, BDPA can be easily removed from the hyperpolarized solution by a simple mechanical filtration, when water is used for dissolution.",
                "Single crystals of the new multiferroic Ba3NbFe3Si2O14 have been synthesized and characterized via X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, NMR, and electric polarization measurements. The underlying topology of the Fe 3+ spins is composed of isolated triangular units stacked in 2D layers along the c-direction of the trigonal lattice. Magnetic susceptibility experiments verify the spin state of the iron moments (S = 5\/2), and large antiferromagnetic interactions with \u03b8 = \u2212190 K. A cusp in the susceptibility and lambda-like feature in the specific heat indicate a magnetic phase transition at TN = 26 K, resulting in a frustration index of f = 7. A significant amount of spin entropy is released at higher temperatures, suggestive of short-ranged magnetic correlations developing at 50 K (as evidenced by features in the specific heat and thermal conductivity). The development of a spontaneous electric polarization below 26 K \u2026",
                "We have performed temperature-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements of the stable free radical trityl OX063, an efficient polarizing agent for dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), at the optimum DNP concentration (15 mM). We have found that (i) when compared to the W-band electron spin\u2013lattice relaxation rate T1e\u22121 of other free radicals used in DNP at the same concentration, trityl OX063 has slower T1e\u22121 than BDPA and 4-oxo-TEMPO. At T > 20 K, the T1e\u22121vs. T data of trityl OX063 appears to follow a power law dependence close to the Raman process prediction whereas at T < 10 K, electronic relaxation slows and approaches the direct process behaviour. (ii) Gd3+ doping, a factor known to enhance DNP, of trityl OX063 samples measured at W-band resulted in monotonic increases of T1e\u22121 especially at temperatures below 20\u201340 K while the ESR lineshapes remained \u2026",
                "Replacement of protons by deuterons in the glassing solvents led to 2\u20133-fold improvement of the 13C dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid-state NMR signal for samples doped with large electron spin resonance (ESR) linewidth free radicals galvinoxyl, DPPH, and 4-oxo-TEMPO. Meanwhile, the reverse effect is observed for 13C DNP using small ESR linewidth free radicals BDPA and trityl OX063.",
                "Silver compounds and complexes are an important class of materials due to the extensive inorganic, organometallic, and medicinal chemistry of the Ag+ ion. A number of Ag+ complexes, in particular, the diphosphine complexes [Ag-(dppe) 2]+ and [Ag (dppp) 2]+, have been shown to have potent antimicrobial and anticancer properties.[1] Complexes of the b-emitting radionuclide 111Ag such as [Ag (dotete)]+ have been suggested for the targeted radiotherapy of cancer.[2] Ag has two naturally abundant, spin I= 1\/2 isotopes: 107Ag (51.83%, 107\u03b3= 1.723 MHz\/T) and 109Ag (48.17%, 109\u03b3= 1.9808 MHz\/T) and thus, NMR spectroscopy would be a very useful method for the structural characterization of silver complexes as well as for the study of reactions involving Ag+ ions.[3] However, Ag NMR spectroscopy is hampered by two major difficulties which arise from the very low gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 of Ag isotopes: 1) low \u2026"
