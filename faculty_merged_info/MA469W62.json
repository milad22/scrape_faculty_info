                "We show that if the solar and atmospheric data are both described by maximal vacuum oscillations at the relevant mass scales then there exists a unique mixing matrix for three neutrino flavors. The solution necessarily conserves CP and automatically implies that there is no disappearance of atmospheric \u03bde, consistent with indications from the Super-Kamiokande experiment. We also investigate the consequences for three-neutrino mixing if the solar and atmospheric oscillations exhibit mixing that is large but not maximal. For non-maximal mixing \u03bde\u2194\u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bde\u2194\u03bd\u03bc oscillations are predicted that may be observable in future long-baseline experiments.",
                "If neutrinos are a significant contributor to the matter density of the universe, then they should have\u223c eV mass and cluster in galactic (super) cluster halos, and possibly in galactic halos as well. It was noted in the early 1980's that cosmic ray neutrinos with energy within \u03b4E E R= \u0393 Z M Z\u223c 3% of the peak energy E R= 4 (eV\/m \u03bd)\u00d7 10 21, eV will annihilate on the nonrelativistic relic antineutrinos (and vice versa) to produce the Z-boson with an enhanced, resonant cross section of O (G F)\u223c 10\u2212 32 cm 2. The result of the resonant neutrino annihilation is a hadronic Z-burst 70% of the time, which contains, on average, thirty photons and 2.7 nucleons with energies near or above the GZK cutoff energy of 5\u00d7 10 19 eV. These photons and nucleons produced within our Supergalactic halo may easily propagate to earth and initiate super-GZK air showers. Here we show that the probability for each neutrino flavor at its resonant \u2026"
