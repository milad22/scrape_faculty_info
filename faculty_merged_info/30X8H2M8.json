                "Tissues use numerous mechanisms to change shape during development. The Drosophila egg chamber is an organ-like structure that elongates to form an elliptical egg. During elongation the follicular epithelial cells undergo a collective migration that causes the egg chamber to rotate within its surrounding basement membrane. Rotation coincides with the formation of a \u2018molecular corset\u2019, in which actin bundles in the epithelium and fibrils in the basement membrane are all aligned perpendicular to the elongation axis. Here we show that rotation plays a critical role in building the actin-based component of the corset. Rotation begins shortly after egg chamber formation and requires lamellipodial protrusions at each follicle cell\u2019s leading edge. During early stages, rotation is necessary for tissue-level actin bundle alignment, but it becomes dispensable after the basement membrane is polarized. This work highlights \u2026"

To generate these large scale flows thousands of micrometer-scale motile cilia must integrate their activity across centimeter-scale surfaces. The goal of our lab is to identify the key physical properties of individual cilia that control the collective phenotypes of a cilia array and the structure of the flow it generates. To truly understand how physical observables interface with biological mechanisms we aim to uncover the molecular pathways that control these key parameters. We approach our research from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining the frameworks of cell and developmental biology, fluid mechanics and active matter. Day to day we do live microscopy, molecular perturbations, quantitative image analysis and collaborate closely with theorists to develop computational and theoretical models. By studying a variety of multiciliated cells and organisms we aim to elucidate the biophysical mechanisms that link cytoskeletal patterning, cilia organization and flow generation.
