His research expertise is in the field of\u00a0space science,\u00a0cosmology,\u00a0astrophysics\u00a0and is a member of several space-based and NASA sounding rocket experiments and instrumentation aimed at understanding the early universe, first stars, and galaxies. He is a member of the\u00a0ESA's\u00a0Herschel Space Observatory-SPIRE Instrument Team and several NASA astrophysics missions planned for this decade, including the Inflation Probe. He has contributed to topics in field such as halo model of the galaxy distribution in the large-scale structure,[2]\u00a0and has developed ways to measure and quantify physical properties of\u00a0dark energy\u00a0and\u00a0dark matter\u00a0in the universe. Cooray is also a Science Editor of\u00a0Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics\u00a0(JCAP). UCI Faculty Profile Joanna Mancilla, mancillj@uci.edu, 949-824-2159"
