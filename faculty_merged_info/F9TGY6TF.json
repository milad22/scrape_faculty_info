                "The newly discovered 39-K superconductor MgB 2 1 holds great promise for superconducting electronics. Like the conventional superconductor Nb, MgB 2 is a phonon-mediated superconductor 2, with a relatively long coherence length 3. These properties make the prospect of fabricating reproducible uniform Josephson junctions, the fundamental element of superconducting circuits, much more favourable for MgB 2 than for high-temperature superconductors. The higher transition temperature and larger energy gap 4, 5 of MgB 2 promise higher operating temperatures and potentially higher speeds than Nb-based integrated circuits. However, success in MgB 2 Josephson junctions has been limited because of the lack of an adequate thin-film technology 6, 7. Because a superconducting integrated circuit uses a multilayer of superconducting, insulating and resistive films, an in situ process in which MgB 2 is formed \u2026",
                "The effect of coupling between layers of the high-T c superconductors was studied by varying both the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x and PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x layer thicknesses in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x\/PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x superlattices. Superconductivity was found even when the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x layers had nominal thicknesses as small as 12 \u00c5 (one unit-cell thickness) but coupling between unit-cell layers is needed to achieve a T c of 90 K. The decrease of T c in isolated YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x layers with increasing sheet resistance is on the same scale of about \u0127\/e 2 as observed for ordinary superconductors.",
                "The magnetoresistance of epitaxial Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO\u03b4 thin films has been studied. A giant magnetoresistance, with more than 4 orders of magnitude change in resistance (\u2212\u0394R\/RH\u2273106%), was obtained at \u223c60 K and a magnetic field of 8 T. This giant magnetoresistance (GMR) ratio is about one order of magnitude larger than the highest value reported previously which was observed in La\u2013Ca\u2013Mn\u2013O film. We have also obtained a large GMR ratio with \u2212\u0394R\/RH\u22733000% for H=5 T in an in situ Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO\u03b4 thin film, a much larger effect than the previous results in doped manganese oxide films in which a large GMR ratio was obtained only in postannealed samples. Our results also show that the GMR effect in these films can be strongly influenced by the thin\u2010film preparation conditions.",
                "High-energy electron energy-loss spectroscopy in transmission has been used to obtain information on the symmetry of unoccupied electronic states in the new high-T c superconductors. In particular, for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8, the O 1s and Cu 2p absorption edges have been measured for momentum transfer parallel and perpendicular to the a, b plane. Both \u03c3 and in-plane \u03c0 holes on O, formed upon doping, are compatible with our experimental results. For YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7, in both cases, holes must be in the planes and in the ribbons. Out-of-plane \u03c0 holes can be excluded for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8. In the undoped and doped compounds, the unoccupied states on the Cu sites have & symmetry. There is an admixture of about 10% of lower-lying states probably with & symmetry."
