                "The laminins are a family of glycoproteins that provide an integral part of the structural scaffolding of basement membranes in almost every animal tissue. Each laminin is a heterotrimer assembled from \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 chain subunits, secreted and incorporated into cell\u2010associated extracellular matrices. The laminins can self\u2010assemble, bind to other matrix macromolecules, and have unique and shared cell interactions mediated by integrins, dystroglycan, and other receptors. Through these interactions, laminins critically contribute to cell differentiation, cell shape and movement, maintenance of tissue phenotypes, and promotion of tissue survival. Recent advances in the characterization of genetic disruptions in humans, mice, nematodes and flies have revealed developmental roles for the different laminin subunits in diverse cell types, affecting differentiation from blastocyst formation to the post\u2010natal period. These \u2026",
                "Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices with support, sieving, and cell regulatory functions. The molecular architectures of these matrices are created through specific binding interactions between unique glycoprotein and proteoglycan protomers. Type IV collagen chains, using NH2\u2010terminal, COOH\u2010terminal, and lateral association, form a covalently stabilized polygonal framework. Laminin, a four\u2010armed glycoprotein, self\u2010assembles through terminal\u2010domain interactions to form a second polymer network, Entactin\/nidogen, a dumbbell\u2010shaped sulfated glycoprotein, binds laminin near its center and interacts with type IV collagen, bridging the two. A large heparan sulfate proteoglycan, important for charge\u2010dependent molecular sieving, is firmly anchored in the basement membrane and can bind itself through a core\u2010protein interaction to form dimers and oligomers and bind laminin and type IV \u2026",
                "A simplification of the laminin nomenclature is presented. Laminins are multidomain heterotrimers composed of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 chains. Previously, laminin trimers were numbered with Arabic numerals in the order discovered, that is laminins-1 to -5. We introduce a new identification system for a trimer using three Arabic numerals, based on the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 chain numbers. For example, the laminin with the chain composition \u03b15\u03b21\u03b31 is termed laminin-511, and not laminin-10. The current practice is also to mix two overlapping domain and module nomenclatures. Instead of the older Roman numeral nomenclature and mixed nomenclature, all modules are now called domains. Some domains are renamed or renumbered. Laminin epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domains are renumbered starting at the N-termini, to be consistent with general protein nomenclature. Domain IVb of \u03b1 chains is named laminin 4a (L4a), domain \u2026",
                "The authors have adopted a new nomenclature for the laminins. They are numbered with arabic numerals in the order discovered. The previous A, B1 and B2 chains, and their isoforms, are \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, respectively, followed by an arabic numeral to identify the isoform. For example, the first laminin identified from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor is laminin-1 with the chain composition \u03b11\u03b21\u03b31. The genes for these chains are LAMA1, LAMB1 and LAMC1, respectively.",
                "Significant advances have been made in the application of genetics to probe the functions of basement membrane laminins. These studies have shown that different laminin subunits profoundly affect tissue morphogenesis, starting around the time of embryonic implantation and extending through organogenesis and into the postnatal period. Collectively they have revealed common functions that include the induction and maintenance of cell polarity, the establishment of barriers between tissue compartments, the organization of cells into tissues, and the protection of adherent cells from detachment-induced cell death, anoikis. Interpreted in light of what is known about laminin structure and self-assembly and binding activities, these advances have begun to provide insights into mechanisms of action. In this review we focus on the contributions of the laminins in invertebrate and vertebrate tissue \u2026",
                "Basement membranes are widely distributed extracellular matrices that coat the basal aspect of epithelial and endothelial cells and surround muscle, fat, and Schwann cells. These extracellular matrices, first expressed in early embryogenesis, are self-assembled on competent cell surfaces through binding interactions among laminins, type IV collagens, nidogens, and proteoglycans. They form stabilizing extensions of the plasma membrane that provide cell adhesion and that act as solid-phase agonists. Basement membranes play a role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and help maintain function in the adult. Mutations adversely affecting expression of the different structural components are associated with developmental arrest at different stages as well as postnatal diseases of muscle, nerve, brain, eye, skin, vasculature, and kidney.",
                "The molecular model of myohemerythrin, an oxygen-carrying protein from sipunculan worms, has been refined by stereochemically restrained least-squares minimization at 1.7 1.3 A \u030a resolution to a conventional R-value of 0.158. The estimated positional standard deviation is better than 0.15 \u00c5 for most of the 979 protein atoms. The average isotropic displacement parameter, B, for the protein atoms is 23.1 \u00c5 2. This high average B parameter appears to be due to the overall motion of the molecule, which correlates with the observed anisotropic diffraction. The side-chains of seven residues were modeled in two conformations, ie the side-chains were discretely disordered, and B parameters for several lysine and glutamate side-chains indicate that they are poorly localized. Of the residues in myohemerythrin, 66% are helical, with 62% occurring in four long \u03b1-helices with mean values for the backbone torsion angles \u2026",
                "Cellular polarization involves the generation of asymmetry along an intracellular axis. In a multicellular tissue, the asymmetry of individual cells must conform to the overlying architecture of the tissue. However, the mechanisms that couple cellular polarization to tissue morphogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we report that orientation of apical polarity in developing Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cysts requires the small GTPase Rac1 and the basement membrane component laminin. Dominant-negative Rac1 alters the supramolecular assembly of endogenous MDCK laminin and causes a striking inversion of apical polarity. Exogenous laminin is recruited to the surface of these cysts and rescues apical polarity. These findings implicate Rac1-mediated laminin assembly in apical pole orientation. By linking apical orientation to generation of the basement membrane, epithelial cells ensure the \u2026",
                "Tissue-specific gene expression in mammary epithelium is dependent on the extracellular matrix as well as hormones. There is good evidence that the basement membrane provides signals for regulating beta-casein expression, and that integrins are involved in this process. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of lactogenic hormones, laminin can direct expression of the beta-casein gene. Mouse mammary epithelial cells plated on gels of native laminin or laminin-entactin undergo functional differentiation. On tissue culture plastic, mammary cells respond to soluble basement membrane or purified laminin, but not other extracellular matrix components, by synthesizing beta-casein. In mammary cells transfected with chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter constructs, laminin activates transcription from the beta-casein promoter through a specific enhancer element. The inductive effect of laminin on casein \u2026",
                "Integrin-mediated cell\u2013matrix interactions are essential for development, tissue homeostasis, and repair. Upon ligand binding, integrins are recruited into focal adhesions (FAs). Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an FA component that interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of integrins, recruits adaptor proteins that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, and phosphorylates the serine\/threonine kinases PKB\/Akt and GSK-3\u03b2. Here we show that mice lacking ILK expression die at the peri-implantation stage because they fail to polarize their epiblast and to cavitate. The impaired epiblast polarization is associated with abnormal F-actin accumulation at sites of integrin attachments to the basement membrane (BM) zone. Likewise, ILK-deficient fibroblasts showed abnormal F-actin aggregates associated with impaired cell spreading and delayed formation of stress fibers and FAs. Finally, ILK-deficient fibroblasts have diminished \u2026"
