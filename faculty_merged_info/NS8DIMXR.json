                "The integral intensity of collision-induced wings of isotropic Raman scattering for totally-symmetric vibration has been discussed analytically. The intensity of scattered radiation was considered in the dipole-induced dipole (DID) approach. The radial as well as angular\u2013radial contributions to intensity of scattered radiation were taken into account. Three body radial contribution to integral intensity was evaluated in the Kirkwood superposition approximation. For angular\u2013radial terms we apply B. Ladanyi and T. Keyes' [Mol. Phys., 33 (1977) 1063] approximation, disregarding the \u201cirreducible connected\u201d terms in our formulas describing the integral intensity. For numerical evaluations the Molecular Dynamics (MD) results for the gl1l2m(r12) coefficients of the two-body correlation function were used. Analytical formulae were applied numerically to N2 and CO2 systems."
