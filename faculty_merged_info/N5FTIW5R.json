                "Heat and electricity are two forms of energy that are at opposite ends of a spectrum. Heat is ubiquitous, but with low quality, whereas electricity is versatile, but its production is demanding. Thermoelectrics offers a simple and environmentally friendly solution for direct heat-to-electricity conversion. A thermoelectric (TE) device can directly convert heat emanating from the Sun, radioisotopes, automobiles, industrial sectors, or even the human body to electricity. Electricity also can drive a TE device to work as a solid-state heat pump for distributed spot-size refrigeration. TE devices are free of moving parts and feasible for miniaturization, run quietly, and do not emit greenhouse gasses. The full potential of TE devices may be unleashed by working in tandem with other energy-conversion technologies.Thermoelectrics found niche applications in the 20th century, especially where efficiency was of a lower \u2026",
                "Herein, we report the synthesis of multiscale nanostructured p-type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 bulk materials by melt-spinning single elements of Bi, Sb, and Te followed by a spark plasma sintering process. The samples that were most optimized with the resulting composition (Bi0.48Sb1.52Te3) and specific nanostructures showed an increase of \u223c50% or more in the figure of merit, ZT, over that of the commercial bulk material between 280 and 475 K, making it suitable for commercial applications related to both power generation and refrigeration. The results of high-resolution electron microscopy and small angle and inelastic neutron scattering along with corresponding thermoelectric property measurements corroborate that the 10\u221220 nm nanocrystalline domains with coherent boundaries are the key constituent that accounts for the resulting exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity and significant improvement of ZT.",
                "Half-Heusler thermoelectric materials Hf1\u2212xZrxNiSn1\u2212ySby (x = 0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5; y = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) have been prepared by levitation melting followed by spark plasma sintering or hot pressing. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy observation show that single-phased half-Heusler compounds without compositional segregations have been obtained by levitation melting in a time-efficient manner. A small amount of Sb doping can improve the electrical power factor but undesirably increases the thermal conductivity due to the increased carrier thermal conductivity. The isoelectronic substitution of Zr for Hf substantially decreased the lattice thermal conductivity. A state-of-the-art ZT value of 1.0 has been attained at 1000 K for the levitation-melted and spark-plasma-sintered Hf0.6Zr0.4NiSn0.98Sb0.02, which is one of the highest achieved ZT values for half-Heusler thermoelectric alloys."
