                "J. Greogory Stacy, PHD Associate Professor of Physics & Astronomy Ph.D., 1985 - University of Maryland 359-B Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-3557-Office, 771-2831-Southern Univ. gstacy@phys.lsu.edu Space Science \/ Particle Astrophysics Greg Stacy holds a joint faculty appointment between the Department of Physics at\n                  Southern University and the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Louisiana State\n                  University. At LSU he is a member of the Space Science\/Particle Astrophysics research\n                  group. His primary research experience is in the area of astronomy and astrophysics,\n                  in particular high-energy astrophysics. He is a member of the instrument team for\n                  the Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) , one of four gamma-ray detectors in orbit aboard NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory . Dr. Stacy's main research program at present involves the multiwavelength study\n                  of active galaxies, using data acquired with space satellites and ground-based observatories.\n                  He is also actively involved, with colleagues at LSU and elsewhere, in an experimental\n                  effort to develop a new type of x-ray\/gamma-ray detector. This new instrument (MARGIE)\n                  will be flown by high-altitude scientific balloon to study the properties of high-energy\n                  cosmic sources. Dr. Stacy's research programs are funded primarily through grants\n                  awarded by NASA, NSF, and the Louisiana Board of Regents."
