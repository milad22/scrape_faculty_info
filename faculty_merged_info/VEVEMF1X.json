                "A broad overview of the current status of proton stability in unified models of particle interactions is given which includes non-supersymmetric unification, SUSY and SUGRA unified models, unification based on extra dimensions, and string-M-theory models. The extra dimensional unification includes 5D and 6D and universal extra dimensional (UED) models, and models based on warped geometry. Proton stability in a wide array of string theory and M theory models is reviewed. These include Calabi\u2013Yau models, grand unified models with Kac\u2013Moody levels k> 1, a new class of heterotic string models, models based on intersecting D branes, and string landscape models. The destabilizing effect of quantum gravity on the proton is discussed. The possibility of testing grand unified models, models based on extra dimensions and string-M-theory models via their distinctive modes is investigated. The proposed next \u2026",
                "We demonstrate how to systematically test a well-motivated mechanism for neutrino mass generation (type II seesaw) at the LHC, in which a Higgs triplet is introduced. In the optimistic scenarios with a small Higgs triplet vacuum expectation value v \u0394< 10\u2212 4 GeV, one can look for clean signals of lepton-number violation in the decays of doubly charged (H\u00b1\u00b1) and singly charged (H\u00b1) Higgs bosons to distinguish the normal hierarchy (NH), the inverted hierarchy (IH), and the quasidegenerate (QD) spectrum for the light neutrino masses. The observation of either H+\u2192 \u03c4+ \u03bd or H+\u2192 e+ \u03bd will be particularly robust for the spectrum test since they are independent of the unknown Majorana phases. The H++ decays moderately depend on a Majorana phase \u03a6 2 in the NH, but sensitively depend on \u03a6 1 in the IH. In a less favorable scenario v \u0394> 2\u00d7 10\u2212 4 GeV, when the leptonic channels are suppressed, one needs to \u2026",
                "We investigate a simple theory where baryon number (B) and lepton number (L) are local gauge symmetries. In this theory B and L are on the same footing and the anomalies are canceled by adding a single new fermionic generation. There is an interesting realization of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses. Furthermore, there is a natural suppression of flavor violation in the quark and leptonic sectors since the gauge symmetries and particle content forbid tree level flavor changing neutral currents involving the quarks or charged leptons. Also one finds that the stability of a dark matter candidate is an automatic consequence of the gauge symmetry. Some constraints and signals at the Large Hadron Collider are briefly discussed.",
                "We systematically study proton decay in the minimal supersymmetric SU (5) grand unified theory. We find that although the available parameter space of soft masses and mixings is quite constrained, the theory is still in accord with experiment.",
                "This document reports on a series of experimental and theoretical studies conducted to assess the astro-particle physics potential of three future large scale particle detectors proposed in Europe as next generation underground observatories. The proposed apparatuses employ three different and, to some extent, complementary detection techniques: GLACIER (liquid argon TPC), LENA (liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (water Cherenkov), based on the use of large mass of liquids as active detection media. The results of these studies are presented along with a critical discussion of the performance attainable by the three proposed approaches coupled to existing or planned underground laboratories, in relation to open and outstanding physics issues such as the search for matter instability, the detection of astrophysical neutrinos and geo-neutrinos and to the possible use of these detectors in future high intensity \u2026",
                "We investigate predictions of a minimal realistic non-supersymmetric SU (5) grand unified theory. To accomplish unification and generate neutrino mass we introduce one extra Higgs representation\u2014a 15 of SU (5)\u2014to the particle content of the minimal Georgi\u2013Glashow scenario. Generic prediction of this setup is a set of rather light scalar leptoquarks. In the case of the most natural implementation of the type II see-saw mechanism their mass is in the phenomenologically interesting region (O (10 2\u201310 3) GeV). As such, our scenario has a potential to be tested at the next generation of collider experiments, particularly at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The presence of the 15 generates additional contributions to proton decay which, for light scalar leptoquarks, can be more important than the usual gauge d= 6 ones. We exhaustively study both and show that the scenario is not excluded by current \u2026",
                "The Large Hadron Collider presents an unprecedented opportunity to probe the realm of new physics in the TeV region and shed light on some of the core unresolved issues of particle physics. These include the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking, the origin of mass, the possible constituent of cold dark matter, new sources of CP violation needed to explain the baryon excess in the universe, the possible existence of extra gauge groups and extra matter, and importantly the path Nature chooses to resolve the hierarchy problem \u2013 is it supersymmetry or extra dimensions. Many models of new physics beyond the standard model contain a hidden sector which can be probed at the LHC. Additionally, the LHC will be a top factory and accurate measurements of the properties of the top and its rare decays will provide a window to new physics. Further, the LHC could shed light on the origin of neutralino masses if the \u2026",
                "We study the minimal gauged U (1) B\u2212 L supersymmetric model and show that it provides an attractive theory for spontaneous R-parity violation. Both U (1) B\u2212 L and R parity are broken by the vacuum expectation value of the right-handed sneutrino (proportional to the soft supersymmetry masses), thereby linking the B\u2212 L and soft SUSY scales. In this context we find a consistent mechanism for generating neutrino masses and a realistic mass spectrum, all without extending the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetry standard model. We discuss the most relevant collider signals and the connection between the Z\u2032 gauge boson and R-parity violation.",
                "We investigate the predictions of a simple extension of the standard model where the Higgs sector is composed of one SU (2) L doublet and one real triplet. We discuss the general features of the model, including its vacuum structure, theoretical and phenomenological constraints, and expectations for Higgs collider studies. The model predicts the existence of a pair of light charged scalars and, for vanishing triplet vacuum expectation value, contains a cold dark matter candidate. When the latter possibility occurs, the charged scalars are long-lived, leading to a prediction of distinctive single charged track with missing transverse energy or double charged track events at the large hadron collider. The model predicts a significant excess of two-photon events compared to SM expectations due to the presence of a light charged scalar.",
                "We investigate the possibility to find the simplest renormalizable grand unified theory based on the SU (5) gauge symmetry. We find that it is possible to generate all fermion masses with only two Higgs bosons, 5 H and 45 H. In this context the neutrino masses are generated through the type III and type I seesaw mechanisms. The predictions coming from the unification of gauge couplings and the stability of the proton are discussed in detail. In this theory the leptogenesis mechanism can be realized through the out of equilibrium decays of the fermions in the adjoint representation."
