                "Absorbed fractions (@) were calculated for spheres that ranged in diameter from 20@ mto 4.4 cm. The details of the computa tional procedure used have been reported elsewhere (8). Briefly, absorbed fractions for monoenergeticelectrons were calculated with point source kernels and integration over the volume of the sphere. These were then used to calculate absorbed fractions for radionuclides by integration over beta-spectra generated by the computer code SPEBETA (9). Figure 1 shows the relationship between 4@ and sphere diameter for a selection of four of the radionuclides considered. It is apparent that the limitingvalue of4@ is 1 for a volume distribution. This means that as the sphere becomesvery large in comparisonto the radionucide emission range, almost all the energy is absorbedwhen the radionuclideis evenly distributed throughout the volume.",

                "This Phase I\/II radioimmunotherapy study was carried out to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and therapeutic potential of 131I-G250. Thirty-three patients with measurable metastatic renal cell carcinoma were treated. Groups of at least three patients received escalating amounts of 1311I (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 mCi\/m2) labeled to 10 mg of mouse monoclonal antibody G250, administered as a single i.v. infusion. Fifteen patients were studied at the MTD of activity. No patient had received prior significant radiotherapy; one had received prior G250. Whole-body scintigrams and single-photon emission computed tomography images were obtained in all patients. There was targeting of radioactivity to all known tumor sites that were > or =2 cm. Reversible liver function test abnormalities were observed in the majority of patients (27 of 33 patients). There was no correlation between the amount of 131I \u2026",

                " 223Ra-Dichloride (223Ra) is a novel bone-seeking alpha-emitter that prolongs survival in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. We conducted a study to better profile the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution of this agent.Ten patients received either 50, 100, or 200 kBq of 223Ra per kilogram of body weight. Subsequently, six of these ten patients received a second dose of 50 kBq\/kg. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were assessed by serial blood sampling, planar imaging, and whole-body counting. Pharmacodynamic assessment was based on measurements of prostate-specific antigen, bone alkaline phosphatase, and serum N-telopeptide.

                "Auger-emitting radionuclides have potential for the therapy of cancer due to their high level of cytotoxicity and short-range biological effectiveness. Biological effects are critically dependent on the sub-cellular (and sub-nuclear) localization of Auger emitters. Mathematical modelling studies suggest that there are theoretical advantages in the use of radionuclides with short half-lives (such as) in preference to those (such as) with long half-lives. In addition, heterogeneity of radionuclide uptake is predicted to be a serious limitation on the ultimate therapeutic effect of targeted Auger therapy. Possible methods of targeting include the use of analogues of DNA precursors such as iodo-deoxyuridine and molecules which bind DNA such as steroid hormones or growth factors. A longer term possibility may be the use of molecules such as oligonucleotides which can discriminate at the level of DNA sequence. It seems likely \u2026",
                "Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily expressed on benign and malignant prostatic epithelial cells. J591 is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the external domain of the PSMA. The relationship among dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activation for unlabeled J591 has not been explored.Patients and Methods: Patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation were eligible. Each patient received 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg of J591. Two milligrams of antibody, conjugated with the chelate 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2034-tetraacetic acid, were labeled with 5 mCi indium-111 (111In) as a tracer. One group of patients received unlabeled J591 before the labeled antibody; the other received both together. Toxicities, pharmacokinetic properties \u2026",
                "Although fractionation can be used in a discrete radiobiologic sense, herein it is generally used in the broader context of administration of multiple, rather than single, doses of radionuclide for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) or other targeted radionuclide therapies. Fractionation is a strategy for overcoming heterogeneity of monoclonal antibody (MAb) distribution in the tumor and the consequent nonuniformity of tumor radiation doses. Additional advantages of fractionated RIT are the ability to 1) provide patient\u2010specific radionuclide and radiation dosing, 2) control toxicity by titration of the individual patient, 3) reduce toxicity, 4) increase the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for many patients, 5) increase tumor radiation dose and efficacy, and 6) prolong tumor response by permitting treatment over time. However, fractionated RIT has logistic and economic implications. Preclinical and clinical data substantiate the \u2026",

This has been applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the analysis of cell survival curves and dose-response relationships for normal tissues and tumors.
