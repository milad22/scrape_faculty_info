                "Gregory Uyeda Gregory Uyeda Laboratory\/Research Facility Administration Manager Email: Gregory.Uyeda@nau.edu 928-523-2625 36-326 My research work involves developing applications using scanning probe microscopy, optical microscopy, and spectroscopic techniques to support the research interests of the members of the Materials Interfaces in Research and Applications research center. \u00a0A key current interest is the development of a library of chemistries and methods that can be used to achieve surfaces that are defined in the three dimensions of space and additional dimensions of chemical functionality. \u00a0An additional interest is the development of a multi-modal microscope platform capable of utilizing scanning probe, optical, and digital holography techniques for the characterization and manipulation of surfaces created via the methods described above.
