                "The effect of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on incident diabetes mellitus is controversial because traditional meta-analyses are hindered by heterogeneity across trials and the absence of trials comparing angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB). We therefore undertook a network meta-analysis, which accounts for both direct and indirect comparisons to assess the effects of antihypertensive agents on incident diabetes.We undertook a systematic review up to Sept 15, 2006, and identified 48 randomised groups of 22 clinical trials with 143\u2008153 participants who did not have diabetes at randomisation and so were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. 17 trials enrolled patients with hypertension, three enrolled high-risk patients, and one enrolled those with heart failure. The main outcome was the proportion of patients who developed \u2026",
                "ContextCarotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of coronary atherosclerosis and independently predicts cardiovascular events, which are increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). While studies of relatively short duration have suggested that thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone might reduce progression of CIMT in persons with diabetes, the results of longer studies have been less clear.ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of pioglitazone vs glimepiride on changes in CIMT of the common carotid artery in patients with type 2 DM.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, multicenter trial in patients with type 2 DM conducted at 28 clinical sites in the multiracial\/ethnic Chicago metropolitan area between October 2003 and May 2006. The treatment period was 72 weeks (1-week follow-up). CIMT images were captured by a single ultrasonographer at 1 center and \u2026",
                "ObjectiveTo compare age-adjusted and ethnic differences in prevalences of sleep difficulty at various stages of the menopausal transition and to determine the relative contribution of other factors, including vasomotor symptoms, sociodemographics, and psychological and physical health factors, to self-reported sleep difficulty in middle-aged women.DesignA community-based survey of women's health and menopausal symptoms was conducted between November 1995 and October 1997 at each of the seven US sites participating in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. A multiethnic sample of 12,603 Caucasian, African American, Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic women aged 40 to 55 years was categorized into six groups: premenopausal, early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, naturally postmenopausal, surgically postmenopausal, and postmenopausal receiving hormone replacement therapy \u2026",
                "Thalidomide was administered to 83 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), starting at 100 mg by mouth daily and increasing to 400 mg as tolerated. Thirty-two patients stopped therapy before 12 weeks (minimum period for response evaluation), and 51 completed 12 weeks of therapy. International Working Group response criteria for MDS were used to evaluate responses. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis classified all off-study patients as nonresponders. Off-study patients belonged to a higher risk category (P\u2009=\u2009.002) and had a higher percentage of blasts in their pretherapy bone marrow than patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy (P\u2009=\u2009.003). No cytogenetic or complete responses were seen, but 16 patients showed hematologic improvement, with 10 previously transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion independent. Responders had lower pretherapy blasts (P\u2009=\u2009.016), a lower duration \u2026",
                "Differences between blacks and whites have been reported in the incidence of several forms of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and stroke. We examined racial differences in the incidence of cardiac arrest in a large urban population and in subsequent survival.We collected data on all nontraumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Chicago from January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1988, and compared the incidence and survival rates for blacks and whites. We examined the association between survival and race and seven other known risk factors by logistic-regression analysis. We computed incidence rates by coupling our data with U.S. Census population data.Our study population comprised 6451 patients: 3207 whites, 2910 blacks, and 334 persons of other races. The incidence of cardiac arrest was significantly higher for blacks than for whites in every age \u2026",
                "BACKGROUND: Premature menopause, also termed premature ovarian failure (POF), is characterized by cessation of menstruation before the age of 40 years. Little information is available on the general prevalence of POF or on the prevalence by ethnic group. There is also a lack of information on the association of POF with health indicators. METHODS: A cross\u2010sectional survey of women aged 40\u201355 years was conducted at seven sites in the USA to determine eligibility for a community\u2010based, multi\u2010ethnic longitudinal study of the peri\u2010menopause (The Study of Women Across the Nation, SWAN). Interview data were used to (i) determine the prevalence of self\u2010reported POF overall and by ethnic group, and (ii) assess the association of POF with selected self\u2010reported variables related to health. Cases of POF included only women with no discernible cause for POF. RESULTS: POF was reported by 1.1 \u2026",
                "Objectives. This study examined the association between psychologic distress and natural menopause in a community sample of African American, White, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese women participating in a national women's health study.Methods. A cohort of 16 065 women aged 40 to 55 years provided information on menstrual regularity in the previous year, psychosocial factors, health, and somatic\u2013psychologic symptoms. Psychologic distress was defined as feeling tense, depressed, and irritable in the previous 2 weeks.Results. Rates of psychologic distress were highest in early perimenopause (28.9%) and lowest in premenopause (20.9%) and postmenopause (22%). In comparison with premenopausal women, early perimenopausal women were at a greater risk of distress, with and without adjustment for vasomotor and sleep symptoms and covariates. Odds of distress were significantly higher for \u2026",
                "An atherosclerotic plaque requires a nutrient blood supply, which is predominantly derived from arterial vasa vasorum. A variety of factors (environmental and genetic) contribute to the initiation and growth of atherosclerosis within vessel walls. Chemotactic factors, such as tissue ischemic and hypoxic factors, stimulate the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins, resulting in vessel wall angiogenesis. These developments often precede the formation of the luminal plaque. In this report, we describe the use of contrast-enhanced carotid ultrasound (CECU) imaging for the detection and quantification of intra-plaque neovascularization. The efficacy of CECU was measured against the neovascular density observed within the tissue specimens obtained at the time of carotid endarterectomy surgery. The objective of this study was to provide a histologic correlation between CECU and carotid artery \u2026",

We estimated regression coefficients and odds ratios to determine whether depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score \u226516) predicted increases in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and greater risk of incident diabetes, respectively, over 3 years.RESULTS\u2014Mean baseline HOMA-IR was 1.31 (SD 0.86) and increased 0.05 units per year for all women (P < 0.0001). A total of 97 incident cases of diabetes occurred. Depression was associated with absolute levels of HOMA-IR (P \u2026",

I am currently ramping up my efforts on HUNTER.\u00a0 HUNTER will search for \u201csterile neutrinos\u201d which would be a new form of matter.\u00a0 We start with 131 Cs atoms captured in a magneto-optical trap and laser cooled to sub milliKelvin temperatures, a bit of atomic physics magic provided by our collaborators at UCLA. 131 Cs decays by electron capture.\u00a0 We will look for evidence of a heavy (30-300 keV\/ c 2 ) component in the emitted electron neutrino\u00a0by measuring the vector momenta of all the visible particles (recoiling Xe ion, x-rays, electrons) and reconstructing the missing neutrino mass.\u00a0 I am working with the Temple University group on the charged-particle spectrometers needed for this.\u00a0 Assembly of the HUNTER apparatus should begin around Summer 2020. I am looking for Princeton undergraduates to work on HUNTER this summer \u2013 please contact me.\u00a0 There are also opportunities for Princeton graduate students looking to their Experimental Project. For the past decade, I have been working with the Princeton Particle Astrophysics group (Profs. Calaprice and Galbiati) and others developing liquid argon Time Projection Chambers to detect the very-low-energy nuclear recoils from the elastic scattering of \u201cWeakly Interacting Massive Particles\u201d (WIMPs), a (once) promising model for the Dark Matter.\u00a0 We built DarkSide-50, a 50-kg detector that has been running at LNGS since 2013.\u00a0 I was in charge of the design and fabrication of the TPC, the heart of the experiment.\u00a0 We found no evidence for WIMPS from 50 days of running with atmospheric argon or from 532 days of running with underground argon (which has reduced levels of 39 Ar, a major background).\u00a0 Though designed to look for WIMPs of ~100 GeV\/ c 2 mass, we surprised everyone (including ourselves) by producing what is still the most sensitive search for dark matter particles with masses around 1 GeV\/ c 2 .\u00a0 Though DarkSide will continue with a much larger TPC, I am winding down my efforts on it. Before DarkSide, I worked on the MiniBooNE, a medium-baseline neutrino experiment at Fermilab. \u00a0The Princeton group led the design and construction of this detector in 2001. You can see how the construction proceeded here .\u00a0 In 2007, we reported our first oscillation results , which saw no evidence for the oscillations reported by LSND. The published analysis was the one developed by the Princeton group. In this analysis, there was an excess of electron-like events at low energies for which there is still no convincing explanation.\u00a0 The experiment continued running (without our active involvement) until 2019.
