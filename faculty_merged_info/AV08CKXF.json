Evans was born in Omak, WA and received the BSEE degree from the University of Washington ,\r\nSeattle, and the MSEE and Ph.D.  degrees in electrical engineering and physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) .  \r\nAfter a postdoctoral year at Caltech, he worked for R&D Associates, Marina Del Rey, CA, and was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Washington. He has worked at the Aerospace Corporation , El Segundo, CA, TRW (now Northrop Grumman), Redondo Beach, CA, and RCA Laboratories (now Sarnoff ), Princeton, NJ. In 1992, he joined Southern Methodist University , Dallas, TX, as a Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department .\r\n He was a co-founder, Vice-President, and a member of the Board of Directors of the semiconductor laser company Photodigm (2000-2011) in Richardson, TX.  He is a past President of the SMU Faculty Senate and a past member of the SMU Board of Trustees.  Since 1973, he has worked on the design, growth, and fabrication of photonic devices, especially conventional edge-emitting and grating-outcoupled surface-emitting semiconductor lasers. He has over 280 publications , 32 patents, and is co-editor of the book Surface Emitting Semiconductor Lasers (New York: Academic Press, 1993). He is a licensed professional engineer.  Gary was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) for contributions to the development, fabrication, and understanding of semiconductor lasers. He has served on numerous national and\r\ninternational IEEE committees , is a past Chairman of the Princeton, NJ, and Dallas, TX Sections of the Lasers and Electro-Optics Society (LEOS), a past Chairman of the Santa Monica Bay Section of the IEEE, was an Associate Editor of the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics (1989-1995), was the Finance Chairman for the 1994 IEEE International Semiconductor Laser Conference, a Technical Program Vice Chair for the 1996 International Communications Conference and was Chair of the Organizing Committee of the 2012 IEEE International Semiconductor Laser Conference.
