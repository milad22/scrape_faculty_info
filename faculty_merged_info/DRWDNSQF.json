                "Craig A. Blocker Craig A. Blocker Professor of Physics PhD, University of California, Berkeley, 1980 Craig Blocker is a member of the experimental high energy physics group at Brandeis. This group is currently collaborating on the at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. In the LHC, protons collide with protons at 8 TeV in the center of mass, the world\u2019s highest energy particle collisions. Professor Blocker is particularly interested in several of the very exciting physics possibilities at the LHC, including the Higgs boson, lepton flavor violation, supersymmetry, excited leptons, left-right symmetric models and potential extra spatial dimensions.
