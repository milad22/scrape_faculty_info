                "The interaction of matter and light is one of the fundamental processes occurring in nature, and its most elementary form is realized when a single atom interacts with a single photon. Reaching this regime has been a major focus of research in atomic physics and quantum optics 1 for several decades and has generated the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics 2, 3. Here we perform an experiment in which a superconducting two-level system, playing the role of an artificial atom, is coupled to an on-chip cavity consisting of a superconducting transmission line resonator. We show that the strong coupling regime can be attained in a solid-state system, and we experimentally observe the coherent interaction of a superconducting two-level system with a single microwave photon. The concept of circuit quantum electrodynamics opens many new possibilities for studying the strong interaction of light and matter. This \u2026"

After completing his undergraduate degree in physics from Bates College, Dr. Girvin earned his Ph.D. from Princeton University and trained as a postdoctoral fellow at Indiana University and Chalmers University of Technology in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.\u00a0 He went on to work as a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology from 1979 to 1987, before joining the faculty of Indiana University in 1987. Throughout his career, Professor Girvin\u2019s research has focused on theoretical studies of quantum many-particle systems.\u00a0 Since coming to Yale, his interests have moved to atomic physics, quantum optics and quantum computation. Professor Girvin\u2019s academic research is currently focused on \u2018circuit QED,\u2019 the quantum physics of microwave electrical circuits using superconducting Josephson junctions as artificial atoms coupled to individual microwave photons.\u00a0 He works closely with the experimental team at Yale led by Michel Devoret and Robert Schoelkopf developing circuit QED into a practical architecture for construction of a quantum computer.\u00a0 A particular current interest is quantum error correction using bosonic codes. In recognition of his research and contributions to the field, Dr. Girvin has been elected Fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.\u00a0 In 2007, he and his collaborators, Allan H. MacDonald and James P. Eisenstein, were awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society, \u201cFor fundamental experimental and theoretical research on correlated many-electron states in low dimensional systems.\u201d\u00a0 In 2017, Professor Girvin received an honorary degree from Chalmers University of Technology in recognition of his work co-developing circuit QED.
