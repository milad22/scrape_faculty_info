                "Friction, wear and lubrication between materials in contact are of fundamental importance in many pure and applied sciences. Owing to the development of experimental and computer-simulation techniques for studying these phenomena at the atomic scale, an understanding is beginning to emerge of the molecular mechanisms of tribology in thin films and at surfaces.",
                "While inert as bulk material, nanoscale gold particles dispersed on oxide supports exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity. Temperature-programmed reaction studies of the catalyzed combustion of CO on size-selected small monodispersed Aun (n \u2264 20) gold clusters supported on magnesia, and first-principle simulations, reveal the microscopic origins of the observed unusual catalytic activity, with Au8 found to be the smallest catalytically active size. Partial electron transfer from the surface to the gold cluster and oxygen-vacancy F-center defects are shown to play an essential role in the activation of nanosize gold clusters as catalysts for the combustion reaction.

                "Gold nanocrystals passivated by self\u2010assembled monolayers of straightchain alkylhiolate molecules have been obtained as highly purified molecular materials of high intrinsic stability. Evidence is presented for a predicted discrete sequence of energetically optimal fcc structures of a truncated octahedral morphological motif (see cover). The nanocrystal materials have a propensity to form extended superlattics, such as that in the Figure.        ",
                "Gold octamers (Au8) bound to oxygen-vacancy F-center defects on Mg(001) are the smallest clusters to catalyze the low-temperature oxidation of CO to CO2, whereas clusters deposited on close-to-perfect magnesia surfaces remain chemically inert. Charging of the supported clusters plays a key role in promoting their chemical activity. Infrared measurements of the stretch vibration of CO adsorbed on mass-selected gold octamers soft-landed on MgO(001) with coadsorbed O2 show a red shift on an F-center\u2013rich surface with respect to the perfect surface. The experiments agree with quantum ab initio calculations that predict that a red shift of the C\u2013O vibration should arise via electron back-donation to the CO antibonding orbital."
