Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM).Data from 49 studies with 1863 participants showed that dietary protein supplementation significantly (all p<0.05) increased changes (means (95% CI)) in: strength\u2014one-repetition-maximum (2.49\u2009kg (0.64, 4.33)), FFM (0.30\u2009kg (0.09, 0.52)) and muscle \u2026",

Here we aimed to determine whether the same was true in men with previous RT experience using a whole-body RT program and whether postexercise systemic hormone concentrations were related to changes in hypertrophy and strength. Forty-nine resistance-trained men (23 \u00b1 1 yr, mean \u00b1 SE) performed 12 wk of whole-body RT. Subjects were randomly allocated into a higher-repetition (HR) group who lifted loads of \u223c30-50% of their maximal strength (1RM) for 20\u201325 repetitions\/set (n = 24) or a lower-repetition (LR) group (\u223c75\u201390% 1RM, 8\u201312 repetitions\/set, n = 25), with all sets being performed to volitional failure.

                "Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by a balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). In healthy humans, MPS is more sensitive (varying 4-5 times more than MPB) to changes in protein feeding and loading indicating that it is the primary locus determining gains in muscle mass. Performing resistance exercise (RE) followed by the consumption of protein results in an augmentation of MPS and, over time, can lead to muscle hypertrophy. The magnitude of the RE-induced increase in MPS (and potentially subsequent hypertrophy) is dictated by a variety of factors including: the dose of protein, source of protein, and possibly the distribution and timing of post-exercise protein ingestion. In addition, RE variables such as frequency of sessions, time under tension, volume, and training status play roles in regulating MPS. This review provides a brief overview of our current understanding of how RE and protein ingestion can influence gains in skeletal muscle mass in young, healthy individuals. It is the goal of this review to provide nutritional recommendations for optimal skeletal muscle adaptation. Specifically, we will focus on how the manipulation of protein intake during the recovery period following RE augments the adaptive response.",
                "Skeletal muscle supports locomotion and serves as the largest site of postprandial glucose disposal; thus it is a critical organ for physical and metabolic health. Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by the processes of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB), both of which are sensitive to external loading and aminoacidemia. Hyperaminoacidemia results in a robust but transient increase in rates of MPS and a mild suppression of MPB. Resistance exercise potentiates the aminoacidemia-induced rise in MPS that, when repeated over time, results in gradual radial growth of skeletal muscle (ie, hypertrophy). Factors that affect MPS include both quantity and composition of the amino acid source. Specifically, MPS is stimulated in a dose-responsive manner and the primary amino acid agonist of this process is leucine. MPB also appears to be regulated in part by protein intake, which can exert a suppressive effect on MPB. At high protein doses the suppression of MPB may interfere with skeletal muscle adaptation following resistance exercise. In this review, we examine recent advancements in our understanding of how protein ingestion impacts skeletal muscle growth following resistance exercise in young adults during energy balance and energy restriction. We also provide practical recommendations for exercisers who wish to maximize the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle during resistance exercise training. View Full-Text",
                "Purpose of review Skeletal muscle mass with aging, during critical care, and following critical care is a determinant of quality of life and survival. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that underpin skeletal muscle atrophy and recommendations to offset skeletal muscle atrophy with aging and during, as well as following, critical care. Recent findings Anabolic resistance is responsible, in part, for skeletal muscle atrophy with aging, muscle disuse, and during disease states. Anabolic resistance describes the reduced stimulation of muscle protein synthesis to a given dose of protein\/amino acids and contributes to declines in skeletal muscle mass. Physical inactivity induces: anabolic resistance (that is likely exacerbated with aging), insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, decreased satellite cell content, and decreased capillary density. Critical illness results in rapid skeletal muscle atrophy that is a result of both \u2026",
                "Physical inactivity impairs insulin sensitivity, which is exacerbated with aging. We examined the impact of 2 wk of acute inactivity and recovery on glycemic control, and integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis in older men and women.Twenty-two overweight, prediabetic older adults (12 men, 10 women, 69 \u00b1 4 y) undertook 7 d of habitual activity (baseline; BL), step reduction (SR; <1,000 steps.d\u22121 for 14 d), followed by 14 d of recovery (RC). An oral glucose tolerance test was used to assess glycemic control and deuterated water ingestion to measure integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis.Daily step count was reduced (all p < .05) from BL at SR (7362 \u00b1 3294 to 991 \u00b1 97) and returned to BL levels at RC (7117 \u00b1 3819).

                "The factors that underpin heterogeneity in muscle hypertrophy following resistance exercise training (RET) remain largely unknown. We examined circulating hormones, intramuscular hormones, and intramuscular hormone-related variables in resistance-trained men before and after 12 wk of RET. Backwards elimination and principal component regression evaluated the statistical significance of proposed circulating anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dihydrotestosterone, insulin-like growth factor-1, free insulin-like growth factor-1, luteinizing hormone, and growth hormone) and RET-induced changes in muscle mass (n=49). Immunoblots and immunoassays were used to evaluate intramuscular free testosterone levels, dihydrotestosterone levels, 5a-reductase expression, and androgen receptor content in the highest- (HIR; n=10) and lowest- (LOR; n=10) responders to the 12 wk of RET. No hormone measured before exercise, after exercise, pre-intervention, or post-intervention was consistently significant or consistently selected in the final model for the change in: type 1 cross sectional area (CSA), type 2 CSA, or fat- and bone-free mass (LBM). Principal component analysis did not result in large dimension reduction and principal component regression was no more effective than unadjusted regression analyses. No hormone measured in the blood or muscle was different between HIR and LOR. The steroidogenic enzyme 5a-reductase increased following RET in the HIR (P<0.01) but not the LOR (P=0.32). Androgen receptor content was unchanged with RET but was higher at all times in HIR \u2026",
                "Higher-protein (HP) diets are advocated for several reasons, including mitigation of sarcopenia, but their effects on kidney function are unclear.This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of HP intakes on kidney function in healthy adults.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing HP (\u22651.5 g\/kg body weight or \u226520% energy intake or \u2265100 g protein\/d) with normal- or lower-protein (NLP; \u22655% less energy intake from protein\/d compared with HP group) intakes on kidney function.

                " Performing resistance exercise with heavier loads is often proposed to be necessary for the recruitment of larger motor units and activation of type II muscle fibres, leading to type II fibre hypertrophy. Indirect measures [surface electromyography (EMG)] have been used to support this thesis, although we propose that lighter loads lifted to task failure (i.e. volitional fatigue) result in the similar activation of type II fibres. In the present study, participants performed resistance exercise to task failure with heavier and lighter loads with both a normal and longer repetition duration (i.e. time under tension). Type I and type II muscle fibre glycogen depletion was determined by neither load, nor repetition duration during resistance exercise performed to task failure. Surface EMG amplitude was not related to muscle fibre glycogen depletion or anabolic signalling; however, muscle fibre glycogen depletion and anabolic \u2026",
                "Discrepancies regarding the effect of resistance exercise training (RET) on arterial stiffness have led to uncertainty regarding the effect of RET on cardiovascular health. Confounding our understanding in this area are the roles of the following: load (heavier vs lighter), participant cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness assessment method. We aimed to investigate the effects of a heavier versus a lighter load resistance training protocol on both central and local arterial stiffness in previously trained young men. Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-wk supervised whole-body RET program consisting of three sets of 8-12 repetitions (heavier-load, lower-repetition [LR]; n= 16) or three sets of 20-25 repetitions (lighter-load, higher-repetition [HR]; n= 16) to volitional failure, or a control group who maintained their regular activity habits (n= 14). Central arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity), local arterial stiffness (common carotid arterial distensibility), and left ventricular mass were measured before and after 12 wk of RET. There was a reduction in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in both LR (6.24\u00b10.56 vs 5.77\u00b10.76 m\u00b7 s; P< 0.05) and HR (6.42\u00b10.70 vs 5.72\u00b10.60 m\u00b7 s; P< 0.05) with no changes in carotid distensibility (P= 0.52) or left ventricular mass allometrically scaled to fat-free mass (P= 0.60). There were no changes in any variable in the control group. Using current criterion-standard assessment methods, central arterial stiffness was reduced after resistance training, regardless of the load lifted during RET, with no effect on local carotid artery distensibility or left ventricular mass.
