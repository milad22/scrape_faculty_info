                "The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell\u2010released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (\u201cMISEV\u201d) guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these \u201cMISEV2014\u201d guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to \u2026",
                "To increase cationic liposome-mediated intravenous DNA delivery extruded DOTAPicholesterol lipo-somes were used to form complexes with DNA, resulting in enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in most tissues examined. The DNA: liposome ratio, and mild sonication, heating, and extrusion steps used for liposome preparation were crucial for improved systemic delivery. Size fractionation studies showed that maximal gene expression was produced by a homogeneous population of DNA: liposome complexes between 200 to 450 nm in size. Cryo-electron microscopy examination demonstrates that the DNA: liposome complexes have a novel morphology, and that the DNA is condensed on the interior of invaginated liposomes between two lipid bilayers. This structure could account for the high efficiency of gene delivery in vivo and for the broad tissue distribution of the DNA \u2026",
                "Nitric oxide (NO) has earned the reputation of being a signaling mediator with many diverse and often opposing biological activities. The diversity in response to this simple diatomic molecule comes from the enormous variety of chemical reactions and biological properties associated with it. In the past few years, the importance of steady-state NO concentrations has emerged as a key determinant of its biological function. Precise cellular responses are differentially regulated by specific NO concentration. We propose five basic distinct concentration levels of NO activity: cGMP-mediated processes ([NO] < 1\u201330 nM), Akt phosphorylation ([NO] = 30\u2013100 nM), stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 ([NO] = 100\u2013300 nM), phosphorylation of p53 ([NO] > 400 nM), and nitrosative stress (1 \u03bcM). In general, lower NO concentrations promote cell survival and proliferation, whereas higher levels favor cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence \u2026",
                "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a potent growth regulatory protein secreted by virtually all cells in a latent form. A major mechanism of regulating TGF-\u03b2 activity occurs through factors that control the processing of the latent to the biologically active form of the molecule. We have shown previously that thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), a platelet \u03b1-granule and extracellular matrix protein, activates latent TGF-\u03b2 via a protease- and cell-independent mechanism and have localized the TGF-\u03b2 binding\/activation region to the type 1 repeats of platelet TSP1. We now report that recombinant human TSP1, but not recombinant mouse TSP2, activates latent TGF-\u03b2. Activation was further localized to the unique sequence RFK found between the first and the second type 1 repeats of TSP1 (amino acids 412-415) by the use of synthetic peptides. A peptide with the corresponding sequence in TSP2, RIR, was inactive. In addition, a \u2026",
                "Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 \u2026",
                "Components of the extracellular matrix have been shown to modulate the interaction of endothelial cells with their microenvironment. Here we report that thrombospondin (TSP), an extracellular matrix component, induces adhesion and spreading of murine lung capillary (LE-II) and bovine aortic (BAEC) endothelial cells. This TSP-induced spreading was inhibited by heparin and fucoidan, known to bind the amino-terminal globular domain of the molecule. In addition, endothelial cells were induced to migrate by a gradient of soluble TSP (chemotaxis). The chemotactic response was inhibited by heparin and fucoidan, as well as by the mAb A2.5, which also binds to the amino-terminal domain. These data are in agreement with our previous observation that the TSP aminoterminal heparin binding region is responsible for the induction of tumor cell spreading and chemotactic motility. The inhibition of chemotaxis and \u2026",
                "Previous studies demonstrated that metastatic MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells synthesized and secreted less of the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) than nonmetastatic breast carcinoma cell lines, a trend also observed for melanoma and lung carcinoma cell lines. To directly examine the effect of tumor cell TSP1 expression on tumor growth and metastasis, MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with full length THBS-1 cDNA linked to a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, or with the cytomegalovirus vector alone. Injection of transfected clones that overexpressed TSP1 into the mammary fat pad of nude mice resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of primary tumor size and an inhibition of spontaneous pulmonary metastases, which occurred in 21\u201330% of THBS-1 transfectants compared to 44\u201349% of controls (P = 0.007). An additional clone was identified that overexpressed a COOH \u2026",
                "Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes containing mature trophozoites and schizonts sequester along venular endothelium 1 and are not in the peripheral circulation of patients with malaria. Knobs appear on infected erythrocytes and are the points of attachment to endothelium 2. Sequestration may protect the parasite from splenic destruction 3 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria 4. Correlates of sequestration have been developed in vitro using cultured human endothelium 5 and an amelanotic melanoma cell line 6. Knobless strains (K\u2212) of P. falciparum fail to sequester in vivo and to bind to cells in vitro. We now present evidence that the receptor for cytoadherence is the glycoprotein, thrombospondin. Aotus monkey or human erythrocytes containing knobby (K+) but not Aotus erythrocytes containing knobless strains of P. falciparum bind to immobilized thrombospondin. Neither binds \u2026",
                "Background\u2014Suppression of tumor growth by thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) has been associated with its ability to inhibit neovascularization. The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1, as defined by cornea pocket assays, was previously mapped to the amino-terminal portion of the protein within the procollagen region and the type 1 repeats.Methods and Results\u2014We evaluated the specificity and efficacy of different regions of TSP-1 using recombinant fragments of the protein on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation assays. In both assays, fragments containing the second and third type 1 repeats but not the procollagen region inhibited angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. To further define the sequences responsible for the angiostatic effect of TSP-1, we used synthetic peptides. The CAM assay defined 2 sequences that independently suppressed angiogenesis. The \u2026",
                "Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) inhibits angiogenesis and modulates endothelial cell adhesion, motility, and growth. The antiproliferative activity of TSP1 is mimicked by synthetic peptides derived from the type I repeats of TSP1 that antagonize fibroblast growth factor 2 and activate latent transforming growth factor \u03b2. These TSP1 analogues induced programmed cell death in bovine aortic endothelial cells based on morphological changes, assessment of DNA fragmentation, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Intact TSP1 also induced DNA fragmentation. The endothelial cell response was specific because no DNA fragmentation was induced in MDA-MB-435S breast carcinoma cells, although TSP1 and the peptide conjugates inhibited the growth of both cell types. Apoptosis did not depend on activation of latent transforming growth factor \u03b2 because peptides lacking the activating sequence RFK were active. Apoptosis \u2026"
