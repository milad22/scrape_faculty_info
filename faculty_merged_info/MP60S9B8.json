                "The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment of men with prostate cancer has risen sharply. Although cardiovascular disease is the most common reason for death among men with prostate cancer who do not die of the disease itself, data regarding the effect of ADT on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in men with prostate cancer are limited. In the current study, the authors attempted to measure the risk for subsequent cardiovascular morbidity in men with prostate cancer who received ADT.A cohort of newly diagnosed men in a population\u2010based registry who were diagnosed between 1992 and 1996 were identified retrospectively. A total of 22,816 subjects were identified after exclusion criteria were applied. Using a multivariate model, the authors calculated the risk of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity in men with prostate cancer who were treated with ADT \u2026",
                "ContextAlthough partial nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for many patients with early-stage kidney cancer, recent clinical trial data, which demonstrate better survival for patients treated with radical nephrectomy, have generated new uncertainty regarding the comparative effectiveness of these treatment options.ObjectiveTo compare long-term survival after partial vs radical nephrectomy among a population-based patient cohort whose treatment reflects contemporary surgical practice.Design, Setting, and PatientsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with clinical stage T1a kidney cancer treated with partial or radical nephrectomy from 1992 through 2007. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for measured and unmeasured differences between treatment groups, we fit a 2-stage residual inclusion model to estimate the treatment effect of partial nephrectomy on long \u2026",
                " Single institution series have demonstrated that obese patients have higher rates of wound infection and delayed graft function (DGF), but similar rates of graft survival. We used UNOS data to determine whether obesity affects outcome following renal transplantation.  From the UNOS database, we identified patients who underwent primary kidney\u2010only transplantation between 1997 and 1999. Recipient and donor body mass index (BMI) was categorized as underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal (BMI 18.5\u201324.9), overweight (BMI 25\u201329.9), obese (BMI 30\u201334.9) or morbidly obese (BMI \u2265 35). We correlated BMI with intermediate measures of graft outcome and overall graft survival, and created multivariate models to evaluate the independent effect of BMI on graft outcome, adjusting for factors known to affect graft success.  The study sample comprised 27 377 recipients. Older age, female sex, African American race and \u2026",
                "The standard sextant protocol for obtaining transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate has been shown to underestimate the presence of prostate cancer. Studies have demonstrated an increased cancer detection rate with additional laterally directed biopsies. We compared the sensitivity of individual biopsy cores and evaluated combinations of these cores to identify an optimal biopsy strategy.A total of 396 consecutive patients underwent biopsy of the lateral peripheral zone in addition to standard sextant biopsy. The cancer detection rate for each biopsy core was calculated. The sensitivity of different combinations of biopsy cores was compared with those of standard sextant biopsies and with a 12 core biopsy protocol that combined the standard sextant biopsy with a complete set of laterally directed cores.Cancer was detected in 160 of 396 (40.3%) patients.

                "The primary treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer confer equivalent cancer control for most patients but disparate side effects. In the current study, the authors sought to compare health\u2010related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes after the most commonly used treatments.A total of 580 men completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form\u201036, the University of California\u2010Los Angeles (UCLA) Prostate Cancer Index, and the American Urological Association Symptom Index before and through 24 months after treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy (BT).General HRQOL did not appear to be affected by treatment. Obstructive and irritative urinary symptoms were more common after BT (P < .001). Urinary control and sexual function were better after EBRT than BT (P < .001 and P = .02, respectively) and \u2026",
                "Evidence-based guidelines recommend radical cystectomy for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, many patients receive alternate therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation. We examined factors that are associated with the use of radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer and compared the survival outcomes of patients with invasive bladder cancer by the treatment they received.From linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\u2013Medicare data, we identified a cohort of 3262 Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years or older at diagnosis with stage II muscle-invasive bladder cancer from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2002. We examined the use of radical cystectomy with multilevel multivariable models and survival after diagnosis with the use of instrumental variable analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided \u2026",
                "Single\u2010institution series have documented the adverse impact of a 12\u2010week delay between resection of muscle\u2010invasive bladder cancer and radical cystectomy. These data are derived from tertiary centers, in which referral populations may confound outcomes. The authors sought to examine the survival impact of a delay in radical cystectomy using nationally representative data.From the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\u2013Medicare dataset, the authors identified subjects with stage II transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder who underwent radical cystectomy between 1992 and 2001. They examined delays of 8, 12, and 24 weeks and incorporated these delay cutoffs into multivariate Cox proportional hazards survival models. Covariates included age, race\/ethnicity, marital status, Charlson comorbidity index, and cancer grade.The authors \u2026",
                " Decision making for treatment of localized prostate cancer is often guided by therapeutic side-effect profiles. We sought to assess health-related quality-of-life outcomes for patients 48 months after treatment for localized prostate cancer. Men treated for localized prostate cancer (N = 475) were evaluated before treatment and at 11 intervals during the 48 months after intervention. Changes in mean health-related quality-of-life scores and the probability of regaining baseline levels of health-related quality of life were compared between treatment groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. Urinary incontinence was more common after prostatectomy (n = 307) than after brachytherapy (n = 90) or external beam radiation therapy (n = 78) (both P < .001), whereas voiding and storage urinary symptoms were more prevalent after brachytherapy than after prostatectomy (both P < .001).

Urological cancer rates may increase substantially amid a growing, aging population.To describe kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and risk factor-attributable bladder and kidney cancer deaths between 1990 and 2013, by age, sex, and development status.Cancer mortality data were derived from global vital registries. Incidence data from cancer registries were transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality incidence ratios. These sources served as input data for an ensemble modeling approach to estimate bladder, prostate, and kidney cancer mortality. Cause-specific mortality estimates were transformed into incidence estimates using mortality incidence ratios.In 2013, 2.1 million kidney, bladder, and \u2026",
