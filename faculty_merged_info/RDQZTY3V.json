                "A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb\u2212 1 collected at s= 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb\u2212 1 at s= 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113, H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H\u2192 W W (\u204e)\u2192 e \u03bd \u03bc \u03bd in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e), W W (\u204e), b b\u00af and \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212 in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113 and H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7\u00d7 10\u2212 9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model \u2026",
                "The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid. This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers. All of these components come together under the ATLAS simulation infrastructure. In this paper, that infrastructure is discussed, including that supporting the detector description, interfacing the event generation, and combining the GEANT4 simulation of the response of the individual detectors. Also described are the tools allowing the software validation, performance testing, and the validation of the simulated output against known physics processes.",
                "We describe likelihood-based statistical tests for use in high energy physics for the discovery of new phenomena and for construction of confidence intervals on model parameters. We focus on the properties of the test procedures that allow one to account for systematic uncertainties. Explicit formulae for the asymptotic distributions of test statistics are derived using results of Wilks and Wald. We motivate and justify the use of a representative data set, called the \u201cAsimov data set\u201d, which provides a simple method to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of a search or measurement as well as fluctuations about this expectation.",
                "The luminosity determination for the ATLAS detector at the LHC during pp collisions at s\u221a= 8 TeV in 2012 is presented. The evaluation of the luminosity scale is performed using several luminometers, and comparisons between these luminosity detectors are made to assess the accuracy, consistency and long-term stability of the results. A luminosity uncertainty of \u03b4\u2112\/\u2112 = \u00b11.9% is obtained for the 22.7 fb-1 of pp collision data delivered to ATLAS at s\u221a= 8 TeV in 2012.",
                "The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of s\u221a=7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb\u22121. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta p T\u226520 GeV and pseudorapidities |\u03b7|<4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region (|\u03b7|<0.8) for jets with 60\u2264p T<800 GeV, and is maximally 14 % for p T<30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2\u2264|\u03b7|<4.5. The jet energy is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon p T, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-p T jets recoiling against a high-p T jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, aiming for an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The systematic uncertainty of the jet energy determined from a combination of in situ techniques is \u2026",
                "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16\u00d7 16\u00d7 26 m3 with a total \u2026",
                "Detailed measurements of the electron performance of the ATLAS detector at the LHC are reported, using decays of the Z, W and J\/\u03c8 particles. Data collected in 2010 at\\(\\sqrt {s}= 7\\mbox {~ TeV}\\) are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of almost 40 pb\u2212 1. The inter-alignment of the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter, the determination of the electron energy scale and resolution, and the performance in terms of response uniformity and linearity are discussed. The electron identification, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies, as well as the charge misidentification probability, are also presented.",

                "Proton\u2013proton collisions at  TeV and heavy ion collisions at  TeV were produced by the LHC and recorded using the ATLAS experiment\u2019s trigger system in 2010. The LHC is designed with a maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz and the ATLAS trigger system is designed to record approximately 200 of these per second. The trigger system selects events by rapidly identifying signatures of muon, electron, photon, tau lepton, jet, and B meson candidates, as well as using global event signatures, such as missing transverse energy. An overview of the ATLAS trigger system, the evolution of the system during 2010 and the performance of the trigger system components and selections based on the 2010 collision data are shown. A brief outline of plans for the trigger system in 2011 is presented."
