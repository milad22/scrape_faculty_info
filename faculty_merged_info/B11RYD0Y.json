                "We show that a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) population cultured on a low-adhesion substrate developed two hPSC subtypes with different colony morphologies: flat and domed. Notably, the dome-like cells showed higher active proliferation capacity and increased several pluripotent genes\u2019 expression compared with the flat monolayer cells. We further demonstrated that cell-matrix adhesion mediates the interaction between cell morphology and expression of KLF4 and KLF5 through a serum response factor (SRF)-based regulatory double loop. Our results provide a mechanistic view on the coupling among adhesion, stem cell morphology, and pluripotency, shedding light on the critical role of cell-matrix adhesion in the induction and maintenance of hPSC.",
                "The stray light appearing in the low wavenumber region of Raman spectra has long been the intrinsic hindrance in Raman spectroscopy. In this work, we confirmed that the stray light mentioned above originates from the grating secondary maxima of Rayleigh scattering experimentally and theoretically. This result also gives a clear inspiration for the suppression of such kind of stray light."
