                "Recent reports have provided evidence for cross-talk between regulatory T (Treg) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells. However, it is unclear whether NKT cells play a role in the differentiation of Treg cells. By employing NKT cell-abundant V\u03b114 TCR transgenic (Tg) and NKT cell-deficient CD1d knock-out (KO) mice, we examined the effects of NKT cells on the in vitro differentiation of induced Treg (iTreg) cells with IL2 and TGF\u03b2. We found that iTreg induction from CD1d KO mice was significantly increased compared to the control. Also, the addition of isolated NKT cells from V\u03b114 TCR Tg mice to na\u00efve CD4+ T cells from CD1d KO mice during iTreg differentiation caused a remarkable reduction of iTreg cells. Through IFN\u03b3 neutralization, we showed that this reduction was mediated by IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, the main source of IFN\u03b3 during iTreg differentiation was NK1.1\u2212CD4+Foxp3\u2212 T cells. This finding implied that early \u2026",
                "Bacillus subtilis-derived poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid (\u03b3PGA) stimulates dendritic cells (DCs) to produce IL12, leading to CD4+ T cell differentiation toward the Th1 phenotype, but DCs consist of heterogeneous subpopulations with a variety of immune functions. Among these, natural killer dendritic cells (NKDCs) play an important role in anti-tumor immune responses. Herein, we demonstrate the role of NKDCs in \u03b3PGA-meditated anti-tumor immune responses. NK1.1+ CD11c+ NKDCs were stimulated upon \u03b3PGA stimulation in vitro and in vivo to up-regulate lymphocyte activation markers, MHC class I and II, and co-stimulatory molecules. In particular, NKDCs were activated by \u03b3PGA to produce IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1, like NK cells, as well as IL12, like DCs, implying that NKDCs have unique and multifunctional roles. Importantly, NKDCs stimulated by \u03b3PGA conferred stronger anti-tumor effects in mice and showed increased \u2026",
                "Emerging evidence demonstrates that the microbiota plays an essential role in shaping the development and function of host immune responses. A variety of environmental stimuli, including foods and commensals, are recognized by the host through the epithelium, acting as a physical barrier. Two allergic diseases, atopic dermatitis and food allergy, are closely linked to the microbiota, because inflammatory responses occur on the epidermal border. The microbiota generates metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid (\u03b3PGA), which can modulate host immune responses. Here, we review how microbial metabolites can regulate allergic immune responses. Furthermore, we focus on the effect of \u03b3PGA on allergic T helper (Th) 2 responses and its therapeutic application.",
                "Natural killer dendritic cells (NKDCs) possess potent anti-tumor activity, but the cellular effect of NKDC interactions with other innate immune cells is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the interaction of NKDCs and natural killer T (NKT) cells is required for the anti-tumor immune responses that are elicited by \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GC) in mice. The rapid and strong expression of interferon-\u03b3 by NKDCs after \u03b1-GC stimulation was dependent on NKT cells. Various NK and DC molecular markers and cytotoxic molecules were up-regulated following \u03b1-GC administration. This up-regulation could improve NKDC presentation of tumor antigens and increase cytotoxicity against tumor cells. NKDCs were required for the stimulation of DCs, NK cells, and NKT cells. The strong anti-tumor immune responses elicited by \u03b1-GC may be due to the down-regulation of regulatory T cells. Furthermore, the depletion of NKDCs dampened the tumor clearance mediated by \u03b1-GC-stimulated NKT cells in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that complex interactions of innate immune cells might be required to achieve optimal anti-tumor immune responses during the early stages of tumorigenesis.",
                "Graphene oxide (GO) modulates the functions of antigen-presenting cells including dendritic cells (DCs). Although carbon nanotubes affect expression of the MHC class I-like CD1d molecule, whether GO can influence immune responses of CD1d-dependent invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells remains unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of GO on inflammatory responses mediated by \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), an iNKT cell agonist. We found that in vivo GO treatment substantially inhibited the capacity of \u03b1-GalCer to induce the iNKT cell-mediated trans-activation of and cytokine production by innate and innate-like cells, including DCs, macrophages, NK cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Such effects of GO on \u03b1-GalCer-induced inflammatory responses closely correlated with iNKT cell polarization towards TGF\u03b2 production, which also explains the capacity of GO to expand regulatory T cells. Interestingly, the \u2026",
                "Bacillus subtilis\u2010derived poly\u2010\u03b3\u2010glutamic acid (\u03b3PGA) has demonstrated adjuvant activity in promoting Th1\/Th17 cell differentiation. Here, the NC\/Nga (NC) mouse model was used to determine whether \u03b3PGA modulates the outcome of atopic dermatitis (AD), which is known to be a Th2\u2010biased immune disease. We found that oral administration of \u03b3PGA dramatically reduced the development of AD in NC mice. Antigen\u2010presenting cells activated with \u03b3PGA produced pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as IL12\/23 and IFN\u03b3, which, in turn, induced the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Concomitantly, Th2 responses, such as high levels of serum IgE, were dramatically decreased. Furthermore, in vivo \u03b3PGA treatment altered several cellular components of allergic reactions, such as mast cells and eosinophils. Taken together, our results strongly demonstrate that in vivo treatment with \u03b3PGA at early time points can \u2026",
                "The inflammatory cytokine IL32\u03b3 acts on dendritic cells (DCs) to produce IL12 and IL6, which are involved in the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Natural killer (NK) and NKT cells play important roles in IL12-mediated adaptive immune responses, such as antitumor immunity. Herein we demonstrate the effect of IL32\u03b3 on the activation of NK and NKT cells. Upon IL32\u03b3 stimulation, splenic NK and NKT cells could be activated, and this activation was dependent on both IL12 and DCs, which was confirmed by using IL12p35 knockout and CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse models. Furthermore, IL32\u03b3 could induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by NKDCs, a subset of DCs expressing NK cell markers, known to enhance NKT cell function. Unlike conventional DCs, NKDCs produced IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 rather than IL12 upon stimulation with IL32\u03b3. Taken together, IL32\u03b3 will be useful as an \u2026"
