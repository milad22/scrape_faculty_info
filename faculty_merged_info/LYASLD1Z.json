                "Today\u2019s dominant photovoltaic technologies rely on single-junction devices, which are approaching their practical efficiency limit of 25\u201327%. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to multi-junction devices, which consist of two or more stacked subcells, each absorbing a different part of the solar spectrum. Here, we show that dual-junction III\u2013V\/\/Sidevices with mechanically stacked, independently operated III\u2013V and Si cells reach cumulative one-sun efficiencies up to 32.8%. Efficiencies up to 35.9% were achieved when combining a GaInP\/GaAs dual-junction cell with a Si single-junction cell. These efficiencies exceed both the theoretical 29.4% efficiency limit of conventional Si technology and the efficiency of the record III\u2013V dual-junction device (32.6%), highlighting the potential of Si-based multi-junction solar cells. However, techno-economic analysis reveals an order-of-magnitude disparity between the \u2026",
                "Microdisk lasers feature low-loss, high-quality whispering gallery modes 1, 2, 3 that offer the potential for ultralow-threshold lasing 4, 5, 6, 7 that is not limited by challenges in mirror fabrication. Here we report fabrication and optical measurements of GaN-based microdisk lasers with a very low threshold of 300 W cm\u2212 2\u2014orders of magnitude lower than any previous GaN microdisk laser. This is also the first report of room-temperature, continuous-wave (CW) lasing in a GaN microdisk.",
                "We have developed a wet chemical digital etching technique for tuning the resonant wavelengths of photonic crystal (PC) nanocavities over a wide range of 80nm in precise 2\u20133nm steps while preserving high cavity quality factors. In one tuning step, a few monolayers of material are removed from the cavity surface by etching a self-formed native oxide in 1mol citric acid. Due to the self-limiting oxide thickness, total tuning range is based only on the number of etch steps, resulting in a highly controlled, digital tuning ability. We have characterized the tuning behavior of GaAs PC defect cavities of both square and triangular lattice symmetry and proven the effectiveness of this method by tuning a mode into resonance with the charged exciton, and then later the biexciton, transition of a single InAs\u2215GaAs self-assembled quantum dot.",
                "As the world\u2019s demand for energy grows, the search for cost competitive and earth abundant thin film photovoltaic absorbers is becoming increasingly important. A promising approach to tackle this challenge is through thin film photovoltaics made of elements that are abundant in the Earth\u2019s crust. In this work, we focus on Cu2SnS3, a promising earth abundant absorber material. Recent publications have presented 3% and 6% device efficiencies using Cu2SnS3-based absorber materials and alloys, respectively. However, little is understood about the fundamental defect and doping physics of this material, which is needed for further improvements in device performance. Here, we identify the origins of the changes in doping in sputtered cubic Cu2SnS3 thin films using combinatorial experiments and first-principles theory. Experimentally, we find that the cubic Cu2SnS3 has a large phase width and that the electrical \u2026",
                "ZnSnN2 is an Earth-abundant semiconductor analogous to the III\u2013nitrides with potential as a solar absorber due to its direct bandgap, steep absorption onset, and disorder-driven bandgap tunability. Despite these desirable properties, discrepancies in the fundamental bandgap and degenerate n-type carrier density have been prevalent issues in the limited amount of literature available on this material. Using a combinatorial RF co-sputtering approach, we have explored a growth-temperature-composition space for Zn1+xSn1\u2212xN2 over the ranges 35\u2013340 \u00b0C and 0.30\u20130.75 Zn\/(Zn + Sn). In this way, we identified an optimal set of deposition parameters for obtaining as-deposited films with wurtzite crystal structure and carrier density as low as 1.8 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123. Films grown at 230 \u00b0C with Zn\/(Zn + Sn) = 0.60 were found to have the largest grain size overall (70 nm diameter on average) while also exhibiting low carrier \u2026",
                "II\u2013IV\u2013V2 materials offer the promise of enhanced functionality in optoelectronic devices due to their rich ternary chemistry. In this review, we consider the potential for new optoelectronic devices based on nitride, phosphide, and arsenide II\u2013IV\u2013V2 materials. As ternary analogs to the III\u2013V materials, these compounds share many of the attractive features that have made the III\u2013Vs the basis of modern optoelectronic devices (e.g. high mobility, strong optical absorption). Control of cation order parameter in the II\u2013IV\u2013V2 materials can produce significant changes in optoelectronic properties at fixed chemical composition, including decoupling band gap from lattice parameter. Recent progress has begun to resolve outstanding questions concerning the structure, dopability, and optical properties of the II\u2013IV\u2013V2 materials. Remaining research challenges include growth optimization and integration into heterostructures and \u2026",
                "In multinary compound semiconductors, cation disorder can decisively alter the electronic properties and impact potential applications. ZnSn N 2 is a ternary nitride of interest for photovoltaics, which forms in a wurtzite-derived crystal structure. In the ground state, every N anion is coordinated by two Zn and two Sn cations, thereby observing the octet rule locally. Using a motif-based model Hamiltonian, we performed Monte Carlo simulations that provide atomistic representations of ZnSn N 2 with varying degrees of cation disorder. Subsequent electronic structure calculations describe the evolution of band gaps, optical properties, and carrier localization effects as a function of the disorder. We find that octet-rule conserving disorder is practically impossible to avoid but perfectly benign, with hardly any effects on the electronic structure. In contrast, a fully random cation distribution would be very detrimental, but \u2026",
                "Gallium phosphide exhibits a short diffusion length relative to its optical absorption length, and is thus a candidate for use in wire array geometries that allow light absorption to be decoupled from minority carrier collection. Herein is reported the photoanodic performance of heteroepitaxially grown gallium phosphide on planar and microwire\u2010array Si substrates. The n\u2010GaP|n\u2010Si heterojunction results in a favorable conduction band alignment for electron collection in the silicon. A conformal electrochemical contact to the outer GaP layer is produced using the ferrocenium\/ferrocene (Fc+\/Fc) redox couple in acetonitrile. Photovoltages of \u223c750 mV under 1 sun illumination are observed and are attributed to the barrier formed at the (Fc+\/Fc)|n\u2010GaP junction. The short\u2010circuit current densities of the composite microwire\u2010arrays are similar to those observed using single\u2010crystal n\u2010GaP photoelectrodes. Spectral response \u2026",
                "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) etching of-plane GaN has been studied extensively because it is one of only a few available damage-free wet-etching techniques for this material system. Because of its nonpolar nature and low defect density,-plane GaN may benefit from PEC etching even more than-plane GaN has. With-plane GaN, it is possible to achieve smooth, controllable etching, bandgap-selective top-down etching, and deep, anisotropic etching. We have investigated PEC etching of-plane GaN in KOH and and have found etch rates ranging from less than to more than, with roughness that is crystallographic in nature but small in scale. Etch selectivity of 60: 1 between and GaN is observed using PEC etching with filtered light. Anisotropic etching to depths as great as was achieved, with the sidewall profile of the etch controlled by the direction of incident light.",
                "A previously developed molecular level model for lipid bilayers [G. Brannigan and F. L. H. Brown, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 1059 (2004)] is extended to allow for variations in lipid length and simulations under constant surface tension conditions. The dependence of membrane elasticity on bilayer thickness is obtained by adjusting lipid length at constant temperature and surface tension. Additionally, bilayer fluidity at various lipid lengths is quantified by analysis of a length versus temperature phase diagram at vanishing tension. Regions of solid, gel-like (hexatic) and fluid bilayer behavior are established by identification of phase boundaries. The main melting transition is found to be density driven; the melting temperature scales inversely with lipid length since thermal expansion increases with lipid aspect ratio."
