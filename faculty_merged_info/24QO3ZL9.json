My work in recent years has focused on the symmetry breaking mechanism by which particles acquire masses, and more specifically on supersymmetry and supergravity. Supersymmetry provides a possible mechanism for understanding the large hierarchy in scale between the masses of particles studied with accelerators and the \u201cnatural\u201d scale of physics which is the Planck mass. Supergravity, particularly when regarded as the \u201clow energy\u201d limit of superstring theory, provides the best hope at present for unification of all forces. My current research attempts to tie superstrings to observable physics. Current Projects I am studying effective supergravity theories for particle physics, with the goal of addressing the problems of supersymmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking, as well as other aspects of particle physics and cosmology, in the context of superstring theory. A part of this program requires an understanding of quantum corrections in the effective theory. My former graduate students, Vid Jain and Kamran Saririan, and I calculated the divergent one-loop corrections for supergravity coupled to chiral matter. In the course of this work I found a way to regulate the divergent integrals encountered in these calculations that is consistent with supersymmetry. More recently my former student Daniel Butter and I calculated the quantum anomalies in the regulated theory, and work on the implementation of full anomaly cancellation in superstring-derived supergravity models is in progress. A promising mechanism for supersymmetry breaking is a phenomenon called \u201ccondensation\u201d that is known to play an important role in quantum chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions in the Standard Model. A scalar field known as the \u201cdilaton\u201d plays an important role in supersymmetry breaking via condensation. With collaborators in Paris and Boston, I showed how to describe gaugino condensation within the \u201clinear supermultiplet\u201d formulation for the dilaton. With a former graduate student, Yi-Yen Wu, we were able to construct a quasi-realistic model for supersymmetry breaking in superstring-derived supergravity. With former students (Daniel Butter, Andreas Birkedal-Hansen, Mike Cai, Joel Giedt, Ben Kain, Aleksey Mints, Brent Nelson), I have been studying the detailed implications of this model for phenomenology and cosmology.
