Physics, University of London, England, 1\/1968   Description of Research  Summary Statement of Research Interests  Professor Shakeshaft focuses his research on the study of the interaction of small atoms (e.g. H, He, H-) and molecules (e.g. H2+) with strong electromagnetic fields. His current research activity is the  development of methods for representing the resolvent, and hence the wavefunction, of a few-body system on a real basis by analytic continuation in the time-domain.   Honors and Awards   Fellow (or Equivalent) of National Society in Discipline, American Physical Society  members are eligible for nomination and election to Fellowship. Each nomination is evaluated by the Fellowship committee of the appropriate APS division, topical group or forum. After review by the APS Fellowship Committee, the successful candidates are elected by APS Council. Fellowship is therefore a distinct honor signifying recognition by one's professional peers., 5\/15\/1983-  Outstanding Referee for 2009, American Physical Society.The editors of the APS journals have selected 157 new Outstanding Referees for 2010, out of more than 42,000 currently active referees. Initiated in 2008, the highly selective Outstanding Referee program recognizes scientists who have been exceptionally helpful in assessing manuscripts for publication in the APS journals. Selections are based on two decades of records on the number, quality, and timeliness of referee reports. The 2010 honorees come from 30 different countries, with large contingents from the US, Germany, UK, Canada, and France. , 2009-2010    Service to the Profession   Editorships and Editorial Boards   Divisional Associate Editor, Physical Review Letters, 1982-1985    Faculty may update their profile by logging into the Dornsife portal from a computer on campus or off-campus via a VPN connection .
