                "The D\u00d8 detector is a large general purpose detector for the study of short-distance phenomena in high energy antiproton-proton collisions, now in operation at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The detector focusses upon the detection of electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse momentum. We describe the design and performance of the major elements of the detector, including the tracking chambers, transition radiation detector, liquid argon calorimetry and muon detection. The associated electronics, triggering systems and data acquisition systems are presented. The global mechanical, high voltage, and experiment monitoring and control systems which support the detector are described. We also discuss the design and implementation of software and software support systems that are specific to D\u00d8.",
                "If the scale of quantum gravity is near TeV, the CERN Large Hadron Collider will be producing one black hole (BH) about every second. The decays of the BHs into the final states with prompt, hard photons, electrons, or muons provide a clean signature with low background. The correlation between the BH mass and its temperature, deduced from the energy spectrum of the decay products, can test Hawking\u2019s evaporation law and determine the number of large new dimensions and the scale of quantum gravity.",
                "This document summarises the proposal of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group on how to present LHC results on-channel simplified dark matter models and to compare them to direct (indirect) detection experiments.",
                "This document a outlines a set of simplified models for dark matter and its interactions with Standard Model particles. It is intended to summarize the main characteristics that these simplified models have when applied to dark matter searches at the LHC, and to provide a number of useful expressions for reference. The list of models includes both s-channel and t-channel scenarios. For s-channel, spin-0 and spin-1 mediations are discussed, and also realizations where the Higgs particle provides a portal between the dark and visible sectors. The guiding principles underpinning the proposed simplified models are spelled out, and some suggestions for implementation are presented.",
                "We have studied J \u03c8 production in p p collisions at s= 1.8 TeV with the D\u00d8 detector at Fermilab using \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 data. We have measured the inclusive J \u03c8 production cross section as a function of J \u03c8 transverse momentum, p T. For the kinematic range p T> 8 GeV\/c and| \u03b7|< 0.6 we obtain \u03c3 (p p\u2192 J \u03c8+ X)\u00b7 Br (J \u03c8\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212)= 2.08\u00b10.17 (stat)\u00b10.46 (syst) nb. Using the muon impact parameter we have estimated the fraction of J \u03c8 mesons coming from B meson decays to be f b= 0.35\u00b10.09 (stat)\u00b10.10 (syst) and inferred the inclusive b production cross section. From the information on the event topology the fraction of nonisolated J \u03c8 events has been measured to be f nonisol= 0.64\u00b10.08 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst). We have also obtained the fraction of J \u03c8 events resulting from radiative decays of \u03c7 c states, f \u03c7= 0.32\u00b10.07 (stat)\u00b10.07 (syst). We discuss the implications of our measurements for charmonium production processes.",
                "In extended Higgs models, the Higgs boson may decay into a pair of light CP-odd scalars, with distinctive collider signatures. We study the ensuing Higgs signals at the upgraded Fermilab Tevatron, considering the subsequent decays of the scalars into pairs of gluons or photons. For CP-odd scalars lighter than a few GeV, the Higgs boson manifests itself as a diphoton resonance and can be discovered up to masses of a few hundred GeV. For heavier CP-odd scalars the reach extends at most up to M h\u223c 120 GeV. We also discuss the capabilities of the CERN LHC and lepton colliders in these channels.",
                "In the model of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali where gravity is allowed to propagate in the extra dimensions of very large size, virtual graviton exchange between the standard model particles can give rise to signatures that can be tested in collider experiments. We study these effects in dilepton and diphoton production at hadron colliders. Specifically, we examine the double differential cross section in the invariant mass and scattering angle, which is found to be useful in separating the gravity effects from the standard model. In this work, sensitivity obtained using the double differential cross section is higher than that in previous studies based on single differential distributions. Assuming no excess of events over the standard model predictions, we obtain the following 95% confidence level lower limits on the effective Planck scale: 0.9\u20131.5 TeV in the Fermilab Tevatron run I, 1.3\u20132.5 TeV in run IIa, 1.7\u20133.5 \u2026",
                "In theories with the standard model gauge bosons propagating in TeV\u2212 1-size extra dimensions, their Kaluza-Klein states interact with the rest of the SM particles confined to the 3-brane. We look for possible signals for this interaction in the present high-energy collider data, and estimate the sensitivity offered by the next generation of collider experiments. Based on the present data from the CERN LEP 2, Fermilab Tevatron, and DESY HERA experiments, we set a lower limit on the extra dimension compactification scale M C> 6.8 TeV at the 9 5% confidence level (dominated by the LEP 2 results) and quote expected sensitivities in the Tevatron Run 2 and at the CERN LHC.",
                "Weakly-coupled TeV-scale particles may mediate the interactions between normal matter and dark matter. If so, the LHC would produce dark matter through these mediators, leading to the familiar\" mono-X\" search signatures, but the mediators would also produce signals without missing momentum via the same vertices involved in their production. This document from the LHC Dark Matter Working Group suggests how to compare searches for these two types of signals in case of vector and axial-vector mediators, based on a workshop that took place on September 19\/20, 2016 and subsequent discussions. These suggestions include how to extend the spin-1 mediated simplified models already in widespread use to include lepton couplings. This document also provides analytic calculations of the relic density in the simplified models and reports an issue that arose when ATLAS and CMS first began to use preliminary numerical calculations of the dark matter relic density in these models.",
                "One of the most dramatic consequences of low-scale (~ 1 TeV) quantum gravity in models with large or warped extra dimension (s) is copious production of mini-black holes at future colliders and in ultra-high-energy cosmic ray collisions. Hawking radiation of these black holes is expected to be constrained mainly to our three-dimensional world and results in rich phenomenology. In this topical review we discuss the current status of astrophysical observations of black holes and selected aspects of mini-black-hole phenomenology, such as production at colliders and in cosmic rays, and black-hole decay properties, Hawking radiation as a sensitive probe of the dimensionality of extra space, as well as an exciting possibility of finding new physics in the decays of black holes."

Watson, Sr. Professor of Physics Overview Prof. Landsberg has joined the Brown faculty in 1998, following post-doctoral research at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL. Since then Prof. Landsberg has served as a convener of the D0 Exotics (1997-2000) and New Phenomena (2002-2004) groups, as well as the Deputy Physics Coordinator of the D0 collaboration (2004-2005). Since 2005 his main research focus is the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. He was a convener of the CMS Exotica physics analysis group in 2009-2010, CMS Physics Coordinator in 2012-2013 (culminating in the discovery of the Higgs boson), and Publication Commitee Deputy Chair (2014-2015). He also served as the CMS HCAL Detector Performance Group convener (2014-2015), and currently serving as a convener of the CMS B Physics group and pursuing exploration of flavor anomalies that currently constitute the most significant experimental deviation from the Standard Model predictions. Prof. Landsberg is a member of a number of Advisory boards and organizing committees for several international conferences and workshops. He is a Divisional Associate Editor of the Phys. Rev. Lett. journal. He is also an author of a number of publications on collider phenomenology, including the pioneering work on mini black hole production at the LHC, which is among TOPCITE 1000+ artciles. Brown Affiliations Physics Research Research Overview Professor Landsberg does research in elementary particle physics, specifically experimental investigation of the fundamental particles and fields at the energy frontier accelerators. His main research activity is the search for new physics phenomena, including extra dimensions in space. He is a member of the CMS experiment operating at Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) and served as the Physics Coordinator of the CMS experiment at the time of the Higgs boson discovery. Research Statement My research interests belong to the field of experimental particle physics at the energy frontier. This field of physics is concerned with the properties of fundamental building blocks of matter and forces binding them together. What are the bricks and mortar of our universe? What governs their properties, such as electric charge and mass? There is deep connection of physics of the smallest objects (elementary particles) and the physics of the largest scales (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, the universe itself), which is not quite understood yet. We hope to find the answers to the fundamental questions of our existence: what makes the universe around us; why is it made of matter, with very little antimatter remaining around; what is dark matter and dark energy; what is the origin of mass.
