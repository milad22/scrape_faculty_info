                "Three-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscopy has revealed that filamentous actin, when complexed with the cross-linking protein \u03b1-actinin, will spontaneously assemble on a micron scale into a structure comprised of a relatively rigid, frequently branching, 3D network of bundles with characteristic mesh size of the order of the persistence length of F-actin. In contrast, additional nanoscale ordering is observed, as synchrotron x-ray diffraction has revealed a disordered, distorted square lattice of actin fibers within the individual bundles.",
                "The structures of the liquid crystalline chiral subphases exhibited by several materials containing either a selenium or sulphur atom have been investigated using a resonant x-ray scattering technique. This technique provides a unique structural probe for the ferroelectric, ferrielectric, antiferroelectric, and Sm C \u03b1* phases. An analysis of the scattering features allows the structural models of the different subphases to be distinguished, in addition to providing a measurement of the helical pitch. This paper reports resonant scattering features in the antiferroelectric hexatic phase, the three-and four-layer intermediate phases, the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases and the Sm C \u03b1* phase. The helicoidal pitch has been measured from the scattering peaks in the four-layer intermediate phase as well as in the antiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases. In the Sm C \u03b1* phase, an investigation into the helical structure has \u2026",
                "Real-time label-free electrical detection of proteins, including cardiac troponin (cTn), is demonstrated using functionalized SnO2 nanobelt field-effect transistors (FETs) with integrated microfluidics. Selective biomolecular functionalization of the active SnO2 nanobelt channel and effective passivation of the substrate surface were realized and verified through fluorescence microscopy. The validation\/verification of the sensing scheme was initially demonstrated via detection of biotin\u2013streptavidin binding: devices with single biotinylated SnO2 nanobelts showed pronounced conductance changes in response to streptavidin binding. Importantly, the pH-dependence of the conductance changes was fully consistent with the charged states of streptavidin at different pH. Moreover, the specificity of the sensors\u2019 electrical responses was confirmed by co-labeling with quantum dots. Finally, the sensing platform was successfully \u2026",
                "The isotropic to nematic liquid crystal (LC) phase transition is used to create organized assemblies of CdSe\/ZnS core\/shell quantum dots (QDs). Under controlled conditions, well dispersed QDs are expelled from the ordered domains of nematic LC into the remaining isotropic domains. The final LC phase produces three dimensional QD assemblies that are situated at the defect points in the LC volume. Through the luminescence of the QDs we are able to track the movement of the nanoparticles as the phase is formed as well as spectrally probe the resulting QD assemblies. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, combined with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data reveal that the QD assemblies have a consistent inter-particle spacing of approximately 7.6 nm. Additionally, the location of the assemblies is shown to be controllable by utilizing beads as defect nucleation points.",
                "Complex morphologies in lipid membranes typically arise due to chemical heterogeneity, but in the tilted gel phase, complex shapes can form spontaneously even in a membrane containing only a single lipid component. We explore this phenomenon via experiments and coarse-grained simulations on giant unilamellar vesicles of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. When cooled from the untilted L\u03b1 liquid-crystalline phase into the  tilted gel phase, vesicles deform from smooth spheres to disordered, highly crumpled shapes. We propose that this shape evolution is driven by nucleation of complex membrane microstructure with topological defects in the tilt orientation that induce nonuniform membrane curvature. Coarse-grained simulations demonstrate this mechanism and show that kinetic competition between curvature change and defect motion can trap vesicles in deeply metastable, defect-rich structures.",
                "The self-assembly of biological amphiphiles has proved a fascinating topic in recent years, the hollow cylindrical lipid tubule morphology being of particular interest due to its potential applications in \u201csoft\u201d microtechnologies. Lateral coexistence of liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) phases, which may resemble raft formation in cell membranes, was investigated in lipid tubules, prepared from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, egg-sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. Fluorescence microscopy shows that the appearance of micrometer-scale lo domains in the lipid tubule is not an intrinsic phase behavior of the system but a consequence of photoinduced lipid peroxidation. Most interestingly, new photoinduced bilayer structures:\u2009 lipid discs, essentially stable flattened liposomes, were observed for the first time in a model membrane system. This investigation not only aids in our understanding of lipid \u2026",
                "Mesogenic ligands have the potential to provide control over the dispersion and stabilization of nanoparticles in liquid crystal (LC) phases. The creation of such hybrid materials is an important goal for the creation of soft tunable photonic devices, such as the LC laser. Herein, we present a comparison of isotropic and mesogenic ligands attached to the surface of CdSe (core-only) and CdSe\/ZnS (core\/shell) quantum dots (QDs). The mesogenic ligand's flexible arm structure enhances ligand alignment, with the local LC director promoting QD dispersion in the isotropic and nematic phases. To characterize QD dispersion on different length scales, we apply fluorescence microscopy, X-ray scattering, and scanning confocal photoluminescent imaging. These combined techniques demonstrate that the LC-modified QDs do not aggregate into the dense clusters observed for dots with simple isotropic ligands when dispersed in liquid crystal, but loosely associate in a fluid-like droplet with an average interparticle spacing >10 nm. Embedding the QDs in a cholesteric cavity, we observe comparable coupling effects to those reported for more closely packed isotropic ligands.",
                "We demonstrate spectral and polarization modulation of chemically synthesized core-shell CdSe\/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a one-dimensional photonic cavity formed by a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) matrix. A Cano-wedge cell varies the pitch of the CLC leading to the formation of Grandjean steps. This spatially tunes the photonic stop band, changing the resonance condition and continuously altering both the emission wavelength and polarization state of the QD ensemble. Using high resolution spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence measurements, we find that the emission is elliptically polarized and that the tilt of the ellipse, while dependent on the emission wavelength, additionally varies with distance across the Grandjean steps. This work opens up the possibility of designing new QD based optical devices, such as tunable single photon sources, where spatial control of \u2026",

                "In recent years the dispersion and directed assembly of nano-particles in liquid crystal media has proved an interesting field for investigation and one that may yield new hybrid materials for optical applications and fundamental research. In this paper, we investigate the dispersion of quantum dots in different liquid crystal phases, looking at aggregation and pattern formation. Quantum dot self-assembly in liquid crystals is dependent on particle surface properties and concentration in the liquid crystal medium. By varying these parameters we observe some fascinating structures and phase behavior using polarized optical microscopy and fluorescence microscopy."
