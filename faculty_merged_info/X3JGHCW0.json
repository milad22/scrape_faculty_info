As health care organizations endeavour to improve their quality of care, there is a growing recognition of the importance of establishing a culture of patient safety. In this research, the authors use the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) questionnaire to assess the culture of patient safety in Taiwan and attempt to provide an explanation for some of the phenomena that are unique in Taiwan. The authors used HSOPSC to measure the 12 dimensions of the patient safety culture from 42 hospitals in Taiwan. The survey received 788 respondents including physicians, nurses, and non-clinical staff. This study used SPSS 15.0 for Windows and Amos 7 software tools to perform the statistical analysis on the survey data, including descriptive statistics and confirmatory factor analysis of the structural equation model. The overall average positive \u2026",

The main objective of this study was to investigate the cross\u2010level influences of organizational culture on patient safety behavior in Taiwan's hospitals.The authors measured organizational culture (bureaucratic, supportive and innovative culture), patient safety culture and behavior from 788 hospital workers among 42 hospitals in Taiwan. Multilevel analysis was applied to explore the relationship between organizational culture (group level) and patient safety behavior (individual level).Patient safety culture had positive impact on patient safety behavior in Taiwan's hospitals. The results also indicated that bureaucratic, innovative and supportive organizational cultures all had direct influence on patient safety behavior \u2026",
                "The health care industry in Taiwan has faced many challenges in recent years. To tackle those challenges, many hospitals in Taiwan began using management techniques used in other industries. As a result, quality management has become important within Taiwan's health care industry. This study provides a perspective on how this health care industry, by developing both quality control circle (QCC) practices and organizational learning techniques, responded to those challenges. In this study, the authors conducted a comprehensive review of studies published between 1995 and 2007 in Taiwan. The review focused on the quality management, QCC, organizational learning and health care organization aspects reported in previous studies. The authors applied the 4Is (intuiting, interpreting, integrating and institutionalizing) conceptual framework of Crossan et al.  (Crossan, M.M., H.W. Lane, and R.E. White. . An \u2026",
                "This study investigated the extent to which the job demands and job control of nurses were related to their work\u2013life balance.The inability to achieve work\u2013life balance is one of the major reasons for the declining retention rate among nurses. Job demands and job control are two major work domain factors that can have a significant influence on the work\u2013life balance of nurses.The study measured the job demands, job control and work\u2013life balance of 2040 nurses in eight private hospitals in Taiwan in 2013.Job demands and job control significantly predicted all the dimensions of work\u2013life balance. Job demands increased the level of work\u2013life imbalance among nurses. While job control showed positive effects on work\/personal life enhancement, it was found to increase both work interference with personal life and personal life interference with work.Reducing the \u2026",
                "Color image descriptors have been used extensively and successfully in many computer vision applications. However, object colors are sensitive to illumination changes which in turns will affect the performance of object recognition if the image descriptors used are not robust to these changes. To increase photometric invariance and discriminative power, this study proposes an image descriptor for color image matching that is invariant to different illumination conditions. Experimental results show superior performance of the proposed image descriptor over existing descriptors on image matching under changing illumination conditions.",
                "Allergic diseases have increased in children in many countries with modern living conditions. This study used data mining techniques to construct predictive models for prediction of allergy symptom among children in Taiwan from survey data. Among three predictive models, the decision tree model gives the best overall result, with a classification accuracy of 70.3%, followed by neural networks (69.6%) and support vector machine (66.4%). Results indicate that children exposed to environment that contains allergy inducing agents are key factors that trigger allergy symptoms. Family factors, especially heredity factors, are also important factors of children allergy.",

                "Background: Patient safety is critical in healthcare. Studies have documented high level of stress among nurses that may adversely affect quality of patient care and patient safety.Methods: This study measured job-related stress, patient safety culture and patient safety outcomes among nurses in Taiwan. A total of 1562 respondents completed the survey. Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied to explore the relationship between job-related stress, patient safety culture, and patient safety outcomes.Result: Job-related stress was found to have varying influence on the perception of patient safety culture. Specifically, stress related to interpersonal relationship and work environment is negatively related to patient safety culture, whereas nurse\u2013patient relationship stress is positively related to patient safety culture. Meanwhile, patient safety culture was found to have positive influence \u2026",
                "Tanzanian government has been actively implementing financial policies that can improve the living standards of individuals who are not qualified for conventional banking services. However, the adoption rate of microfinance among households in rural areas is low. Therefore, this study examines the direct and indirect effects generated by the constructs of the theory of planned behaviour model, perceived barriers and perceived benefits on rural households\u2019 intention to adopt microfinance. Primary data were collected by using questionnaire survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was then used to analyse the structural relationships between studied variables. Current results show that perceived benefits, attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control have direct positive effects on households\u2019 behavioural intention. Meanwhile, perceived barrier generates direct negative effects on behavioural intention. The results also show that attitude could mediate perceived benefits\u2019 effects on respondents\u2019 behavioral intention. However, attitude could not mediate the impact of perceived barriers on behavioral intention. Therefore, policy makers should disseminate the microfinance benefits by engaging people who are important to the respondents, so that favourable attitude among the rural households can be increased. Also, they should educate them on how to utilise the financial services and the possible barriers the users need to face.",
                "Environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, deforestation, and the loss of biodiversity are the concerns of society in different parts of the world today. As human activities have adverse impacts on the environment, developing pro-environmental behaviour in each individual is an essential aspect of protecting mother earth. The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate the influence of green work climate perceptions and harmonious environmental passion on pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). Additionally, the mediating effect of harmonious environmental passion between green work climate and PEB is determined. A total of 167 academics from a private university in Malaysia participated in this study. The results from Partial Least Square\u2013Structural Equation Modelling suggested that green work climate and harmonious environmental passion positively influence PEB. Apart from this, harmonious environmental passion partially mediates the relationship between green work climate and PEB. The results indicate that leaders should actively shape the perception of green work climate within their organisations through policies and procedures that support environmental sustainability efforts, as well as effectively communicate with their employees. Such efforts will lead to greater harmonious environmental passion, in turn, promoting pro-environmental behaviour among members."
