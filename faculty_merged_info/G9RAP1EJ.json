                "After the Tiananmen crisis in June, 1989, many observers thought that the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would collapse. Instead, the regime brought inflation under control, restarted economic growth, expanded foreign trade, and increased its absorption of foreign direct investment. It restored normal relations with the G-7 countries that had imposed sanctions, resumed the exchange of summits with the United States, presided over the retrocession of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, and won the right to hold the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. It arrested or exiled political dissidents, crushed the fledgling China Democratic Party, and seems to have largely suppressed the Falun Gong spiritual movement.Many China specialists and democracy theorists\u2014myself among them\u2014expected the regime to fall to democratization\u2019s \u201cthird wave.\u201d 1 Instead, the regime has reconsolidated itself. 2 Regime theory holds \u2026",
                "Despite its impressive size and population, economic vitality, and drive to upgrade its military, China remains a vulnerable nation surrounded by powerful rivals and potential foes. Understanding China\u00d5s foreign policy means fully appreciating these geostrategic challenges, which persist even as the country gains increasing influence over its neighbors. Andrew J. Nathan and Andrew Scobell analyze China\u00d5s security concerns on four fronts: at home, with its immediate neighbors, in surrounding regional systems, and in the world beyond Asia. By illuminating the issues driving Chinese policy, they offer a new perspective on the country\u00d5s rise and a strategy for balancing Chinese and American interests in Asia. Though rooted in the present, Nathan and Scobell\u00d5s study makes ample use of the past, reaching back into history to illuminate the people and institutions shaping Chinese strategy today. They also examine Chinese views of the United States; explain why China is so concerned about Japan; and uncover China\u00d5s interests in such problematic countries as North Korea, Iran, and the Sudan. The authors probe recent troubles in Tibet and Xinjiang and explore their links to forces beyond China\u00d5s borders. They consider the tactics deployed by mainland China and Taiwan, as Taiwan seeks to maintain autonomy in the face of Chinese advances toward unification. They evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of China\u00d5s three main power resources\u00d1economic power, military power, and soft power. The authors conclude with recommendations for the United States as it seeks to manage China\u00d5s rise. Chinese policymakers understand that \u2026",
                "What do the Chinese mean when they say that their political systems is\" democratic\"? With recent improvements in relations between China and the West, this question is basic to an understanding of the Chinese people in their state. In Chinese Democracy, Andrew Nathan investigates in depth the nature and meaning of\" democracy\" in China today, beginning with a vivid history of the short-lived Democracy Movement of 1978-1981, when groups of young people in a number of Chinese cities started issuing outspoken publications and putting up posters detailing their complaints and opinions. Nathan constructs--for the first time--a poignant picture of this burst of liberal activity, and at the same time he shows how distinctly Chinese it was and how the roots of its failure lay as much in history as in current political necessity. readers of this book will gain a new perspective on the nature of democracy as the Chinese practice it.",
                "Until the Cultural Revolution, the predominant western view of contemporary Chinese elite conflict was that it consisted of \u201cdiscussion\u201d(t\u2019ao-lun) within a basically consensual Politburo among shifting \u201copinion groups\u201d with no \u201corganized force\u201d behind them. 1 The purges and accusations which began in 1965 and apparently still continue, have shaken this interpretation, and a number of scholars have advanced new analyses\u2014sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit, sometimes of general application, sometimes applied only to a particular time span or segment of the political system. Of these new views, perhaps the most systematic\u2014and at the same time the one which represents the least change from the pre-Cultural Revolution \u201copinion group\u201d model\u2014is the \u201cpolicy making under Mao\u201d interpretation, which sees conflict as essentially a bureaucratic decision-making process dominated by Mao. 2 A similar but less \u2026",
