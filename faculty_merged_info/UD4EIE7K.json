                "UBVRI photoelectric observations have been made on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins photometric system of 526 stars centered on the celestial equator. The program stars within a 298 number subset have sufficient measures so that they are capable of providing, for telescopes of intermediate and large size in both hemispheres, an internally consistent homogeneous broadband standard photometric system around the sky. The stars average 29 measures each on 19 nights. The majority of the stars in this paper fall in the magnitude range 11.5-16.0, and in the color range-0.3 to+ 2.3."

                "Arlo Landolt Ball Family Professor Emeritus of Physics & Astronomy Ph.D., 1962 - Indiana University 259-A Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-6795-Office landolt@phys.lsu.edu Astronomy - Stellar Photometry Our research effort has been concerned with the measurement of stellar brightness\n                     and colors, i.e., stellar photometry. Much of our time in the last thirty years has\n                     been spent in the improvement and definition of photometric standard stars. These\n                     standard stars are used as calibration yardsticks when studying celestial objects,\n                     or indeed any objects projected against the celestial sphere, whose characteristics\n                     are unknown. For the case of physical celestial objects, one eventually can relate\n                     brightness and color measures to a variety of physical characteristics. These quantities\n                     in turn help determine stellar distance, define a star's place in stellar evolution,\n                     etc. Research projects also are under way in the areas of star clusters, variable\n                     stars, novae, supernovae, and eclipsing binaries.
