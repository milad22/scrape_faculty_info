                "UBVRI photoelectric observations have been made on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins photometric system of 526 stars centered on the celestial equator. The program stars within a 298 number subset have sufficient measures so that they are capable of providing, for telescopes of intermediate and large size in both hemispheres, an internally consistent homogeneous broadband standard photometric system around the sky. The stars average 29 measures each on 19 nights. The majority of the stars in this paper fall in the magnitude range 11.5-16.0, and in the color range-0.3 to+ 2.3."
