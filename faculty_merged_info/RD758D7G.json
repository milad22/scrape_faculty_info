                "Alfredo Gurrola Assistant Professor Professor Gurrola\u2019s current research activities are with the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) and the Compact\u00a0Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, where he attempts to further the understanding of the smallest building blocks and forces fundamental to understanding the world around us. The LHC and CMS are among the largest and most complicated experiments ever conducted, accelerating particles toward the speed of light and smashing them together to provide a glimpse of the fundamental particles hypothesized to have existed in the early \u201cBig Bang.\u201d Gurrola is using particle colliders to address core unresolved problems in science: e.g. the unknown identity of astronomical dark matter, the full nature of the mechanism responsible for generating the mass of particles that make up matter, and why neutrinos have mass. phone: 915-401-9157 6913D Stevenson"
