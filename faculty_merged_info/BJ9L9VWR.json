                "Evan Schneider eschneider@pitt.edu I specialize in computational astrophysics, with a focus on galaxy evolution and numerical methodology. As part of my research, I develop and maintain the Cholla hydrodynamics code ( https:\/\/github.com\/cholla-hydro\/cholla ), a massively-parallel GPU-based code for astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations. I am interested in all aspects of galaxy evolution, particularly those related to gas dynamics, and in recent years have specialized in the simulation of galactic winds driven by supernovae and other aspects of stellar feedback. Movies of some of my simulations can be found on my personal website. Selected Publications My full list of publications can be found at the following link: https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/public-libraries\/d9pqGzLORp691mTT88_6JQ Orlando Warren Robert Caddy"
