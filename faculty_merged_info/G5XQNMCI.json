                "On September 14, 2015 at 09: 50: 45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0\u00d7 10\u2212 21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 \u03c3. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0\u2212 180+ 160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z= 0.0 9\u2212 0.04+ 0.03. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6\u2212 4+ 5 M\u2299 and 2 9\u2212 4+ 4 M\u2299, and the final black hole mass is 6 2\u2212 4+ 4 M\u2299, with 3. 0\u2212 0.5+ 0.5 M\u2299 c 2 \u2026",
                "We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03: 38: 53 UTC. The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 \u03c3. The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of 3. 4\u2212 0.9+ 0.7\u00d7 10\u2212 22. The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are 14.2\u2212 3.7+ 8.3 M\u2299 and 7. 5\u2212 2.3+ 2.3 M\u2299, and the final black hole mass is 20.8\u2212 1.7+ 6.1 M\u2299. We find that at least one of \u2026",
                "The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry\u2013Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic \u2026"
