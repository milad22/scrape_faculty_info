                "Generation of non-thermal particles in an OB association is studied. A model of cosmic-ray acceleration is proposed where the interaction of charged particles with an ensemble of shocks and large-scale plasma motions inside the bubble is included. The cosmic-ray acceleration appears to be very efficient especially after explosions of a few supernovae in the association. The cosmic-ray acceleration time is of the order of 105 yr. Some tens of per cent of the bubble kinetic energy can be converted to the cosmic-ray acceleration."
