                "Background: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore the efficacy of exercise as a nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce cancer-related fatigue (CRF) among adult cancer survivors. We also investigated how different components of the exercise prescription (Ex Rx), methodologic considerations, and subject characteristics modulate CRF.Methods: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials was conducted using words related to cancer, exercise, and fatigue.Results: In total, 44 studies with 48 interventions qualified, including 3,254 participants of varying cancer types, stages of diagnosis, treatments, and exercise interventions. Cancer survivors in exercise interventions reduced their CRF levels to a greater extent than usual care controls, d+ = 0.31 (95% CI = 0.22\u20130.40), an effect that appeared to generalize across several types of cancer. CRF levels improved in direct proportion to the intensity of \u2026",
                "This review examines the relationship between physical activity and cancer along the cancer continuum, and serves as a synthesis of systematic and meta\u2010analytic reviews conducted to date. There exists a large body of epidemiologic evidence that conclude those who participate in higher levels of physical activity have a reduced likelihood of developing a variety of cancers compared to those who engage in lower levels of physical activity. Despite this observational evidence, the causal pathway underlying the association between participation in physical activity and cancer risk reduction remains unclear. Physical activity is also a useful adjunct to improve the deleterious sequelae experienced during cancer treatment. These deleterious sequelae may include fatigue, muscular weakness, deteriorated functional capacity, and many others. The benefits of physical activity during cancer treatment are similar to those \u2026"
