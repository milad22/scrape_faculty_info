                "Loris Magnani, Professor of Astronomy loris@uga.edu N\/A 238\/241C Biographical Information PhD, University of Maryland , 1987 MS, University of Maryland , 1982 The interstellar medium of the Galaxy is the great reservoir from which stars are born and to which they return much of their mass. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, the interstellar medium can take many forms depending on the temperature, density, and radiation field. Under certain conditions, the majority of the hydrogen will be in molecular form. The resulting aggregations of molecular gas can come in 2 basic types: large entities which can encompass up to a million solar masses and extend up to 50 parsecs, or distinctly smaller objects with masses less than a thousand solar masses and sizes on the order of a few parsecs. The smaller clouds can be subdivided into 3 basic kinds of objects: diffuse, translucent, and dark clouds, depending on their opacity to ultraviolet radiation and to certain considerations involving their astrochemistry. My past work has primarily focused on translucent molecular clouds. These objects can be studied both by optical and radio techniques. Their chemistry is simpler than that of the dark molecular clouds but, unlike the diffuse clouds, chemical species more complex than diatomics can be found (such as H 2 CO, C 3 H 2 , etc.). Although translucent clouds are distributed throughout the Galactic plane, they are most easily seen at high Galactic latitudes, away from the background confusion caused by dark clouds and giant molecular clouds along the Galactic plane. The overwhelming majority of the so-called high-latitude molecular clouds turn out to be translucent clouds. In the last decade, my research has focussed on three principal areas: 1) The large-scale distribution of molecular gas at high Galactic latitudes. 2) Quantifying the turbulence characteristics of small molecular clouds. 3) Estimating the amount of dark molecular gas in diffuse and translucent molecular clouds. I am currently studying the diffuse molecular component of the ISM (i.e., the atomic\/molecular interface in small interstellar clouds) using the CH 3335 MHz emission line, the OH 1665 and 1667 MHz emission lines, and the \u00a0H 2 CO 4830 MHz absorption lines. \u00a0In particular, I am currrently studying the ability of the CH molecule to trace diffuse molecular gas with one of my graduate students, Jayne Dailey. \u00a0My other graduate student, Jennifer Storbeck is studying the high-latitude molecular clouds in the Northern Galactic Hemisphere. \u00a0I am also currently working with three undergraduates, Jessica Cmiel, Mackenzie Joy, and Dan Boyd, on various aspects of the interstellar medium.
