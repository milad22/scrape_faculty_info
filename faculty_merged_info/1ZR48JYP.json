                "Major depression is conditionally linked to a polymorphism of the human serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). During the presentation of aversive, but not pleasant, pictures, healthy carriers of the SLC6A4 short (s) allele showed stronger activation of the amygdala on functional magnetic resonance imaging. s carriers also showed greater coupling between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which may contribute to the abnormally high activity in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex seen in major depression.",

                "In vivo availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) protein has been reported to be reduced among alcoholics, and allelic variation of the DAT gene (SLC6A3) has been associated with severity of alcohol withdrawal. We examined the VNTR polymorphism of the 3\u2032 untranslated region of SLC6A3 and DAT protein availability in 14 abstinent alcoholics and 11 control subjects. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and plasma levels of the radioligand [I-123] \u03b2-CIT were used to quantify DAT protein availability. Individuals with the 9-repeat\/10-repeat genotype had a mean 22% reduction of DAT protein availability in putamen compared with 10-repeat homozygous individuals (t= 2.14, df= 23, p<. 05). Consistent with earlier studies, alcoholism, per se, was not significantly associated with either DAT availability or DAT genotype. These findings suggest that the VNTR polymorphism of the DAT gene \u2026",

                "The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences 1. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement 2, learning, memory 3 and motivation 4, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease 2. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume 5 and intracranial volume 6. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures \u2026",
                "Background: Negative symptoms may be associated with dysfunction of the brain reward system in schizophrenia. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the BOLD response in the ventral striatum of unmedicated schizophrenics during presentation of reward-indicating and loss-indicating stimuli. Methods: A total of 10 schizophrenic men (7 never medicated, 3 unmedicated for at least 2 years) and 10 age-matched healthy male volunteers participated in an incentive monetary delay task, in which visual cues predicted that a rapid response to a subsequent target stimulus would result either in monetary gain or loss or would have no consequence. Results: Compared to healthy controls, unmedicated schizophrenics showed reduced ventral striatal activation during the presentation of reward-indicating cues. Decreased activation of the left ventral striatum was inversely correlated with the \u2026",

                "Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease 1, 2 and is reduced in schizophrenia 3, major depression 4 and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy 5. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable 6, 7, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium.

                "Background: Genetic variation of the promoter for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene has been associated with its functional capacity. In vitro, carriers of a short allele (s-carriers) of the 5-HTT promoter display significant reduction in 5-HTT capacity. Dysfunction of 5-HTT has been observed in alcoholic individuals. We assessed whether the allelic constitution of the 5-HTT gene is associated with reduced serotonin transporter availability among alcoholic individuals.Methods: We genotyped the 5-HTT promoter region and measured the availability of serotonin transporter protein with [I-123]\u03b2-CIT SPECT in the raphe area in 14 abstinent male alcoholic subjects and 8 age-matched control subjects of European American descent.Results: Among control subjects, the ratio of in vivo 5-HTT availability for ll-homozygous individuals relative to s-carriers was comparable to serotonin uptake ratios measured in vitro.

                "Andreas Berlind Associate Professor Director of Graduate Studies, Astrophysics My research lies in the area of large scale structure formation in the universe. How did a highly homogeneous and smooth post-Big Bang universe develop the complex large-scale structures (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.) that we see today? According to the observational evidence, structure in the universe formed mainly through gravitational instability: regions in the early universe that happened to be slightly more dense than their surrounding space collapsed under the force of their own self-gravity to form compact clumps of matter. These clumps, in turn, pulled by each other's gravity, often merged to form even more massive systems. In the currently favored theoretical picture, this simple process has accounted for almost all of the structure present in the dark matter distribution. However, we cannot see dark matter even though it makes up most of the mass in the universe. What we do see tracing the structure of the universe on large scales is galaxies. Unfortunately, the formation of galaxies is a poorly understood process, involving more complex physics than simply the gravity that governs the evolution of dark matter. Gas dynamics and cooling, star formation, supernova explosions, and galaxy mergers are examples of physics that most likely play a significant role in galaxy formation. My research is mainly focused on understanding the relation between the galaxy and dark matter spatial distributions (also known as the \"bias\" between galaxies and mass). I approach this problem from both the observational and the theoretical sides. On the observational side, I work on empirically constraining the bias using measurements of galaxy clustering from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as other galaxy surveys. On the theoretical side, I study what we can learn about the physics of galaxy formation from these constraints. Recently, I have also become interested in Ultra-high-energy cormic rays (UHECRs). These are incredibly energetic particles (greater than 10EeV) that hit the earth's atmosphere and produce enormous showers of lower energy particles. Detecting these showers and reconstructing the energies and arrival directions of the incoming UHECRs requires experiments with large surface ground arrays of detectors or air fluoresence detectors. The origic of UHECRs is unknown because their arrival directions cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. However, large experiments (such as the Pierre Auger experiment) have now collected enough data to make statistical studies possible. Using Pierre Auger data, I am working on correlating the spatial distribution of UHECRs with potential astrophysical sources.
