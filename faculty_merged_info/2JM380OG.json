Self-motivated, team-worked, and detail-oriented professional in creating hardware and software for a wide range of scientific and technical applications. Major directions in scientific research are solar physics, helioseismology, solar internal structure and internal differential rotation, EUV spectral variability, EUV dimming, solar energetic particles.  Detailed Statement of Research Interests    Statement of Research and\/or Teaching Interests  1.  1.  Solar Physics, including Helioseismology, solar dynamics (solar flares, energy release in soft X-ray and EUV during solar flares, solar spectral variability in soft X-ray and EUV, CME initiation, Solar Cycle Irradiance changes and how it affects the Climate Changes), and absolute solar irradiances in soft X-ray and EUV: comparison and analyzes.  2.  Ground-based and space instrumentation for solar and helio-physics research including detectors, imaging (telescopes) and non-imaging instruments.  3.  Adaptive optics.  4.  Radiation and shielding measurements and applications.  5.  Space weather.  6.  Degradation of soft X-ray and EUV instruments.  7.
