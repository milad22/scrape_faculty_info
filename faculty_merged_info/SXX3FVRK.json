                "Stephen Walker Dr. Stephen Walker Assistant Professor, I started at UAH as an Assistant Professor in 2019. Prior to this I have been a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge. My research concentrates on all aspects of galaxy clusters (the largest collapsed structures in the universe), from the outskirts where they are continuing to form from the cosmic web, to gas sloshing produced by galaxy cluster mergers, to studying AGN feedback in cluster cores, focusing on their X-ray emission.
