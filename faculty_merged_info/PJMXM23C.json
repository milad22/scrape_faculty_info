                "We give an overview of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Explorer Mission launched on 2003 April 28. GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350\u20131750 and 1750\u20132750 \u00c5). The surveys include an all\u2010sky imaging survey ( ), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 ( ), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 ( ), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys ( ) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the \u2026",
                "The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite observes light in the far\u2010ultraviolet spectral region, 905\u20131187 \u00c5, with a high spectral resolution. The instrument consists of four co\u2010aligned prime\u2010focus telescopes and Rowland spectrographs with microchannel plate detectors. Two of the telescope channels use Al:LiF coatings for optimum reflectivity between approximately 1000 and 1187 \u00c5, and the other two channels use SiC coatings for optimized throughput between 905 and 1105 \u00c5. The gratings are holographically ruled to correct largely for astigmatism and to minimize scattered light. The microchannel plate detectors have KBr photocathodes and use photon counting to achieve good quantum efficiency with low background signal. The sensitivity is sufficient to examine reddened lines of sight within the Milky Way and also sufficient to use as active galactic nuclei and QSOs for absorption\u2010line studies of both \u2026",
                "We discuss new anode geometries, employing position\u2010dependent charge partitioning, which can be used with microchannel plates, planar proportional counters, and mesh dynode electron multipliers to obtain a two\u2010dimensional position signal from each detected photon or particle. Only three or four anode electrodes and signal paths are required, yet images comprised of a number of detected events have little geometric distortion and the resolution is not limited by thermal noise inherent in resistive sheet anodes. We present an analysis of the geometrical image nonlinearity in the relationship between event centroid location and the charge partition ratios. Fabrication and testing of two wedge\u2010and\u2010strip anode systems are discussed. Images obtained with EUV radiation and microchannel plates that verify the predicted performance of this readout system are shown. We emphasize that the spatial resolution of the \u2026",
                "In a companion Letter (Arnouts et al.) we present new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function at 1500 \u00c5 out to   using Galaxy Evolution Explorer VIMOS\u2010VLT Deep Survey observations (1039 galaxies with   and   and at higher z using existing data sets. In this Letter we use the same sample to study evolution of the FUV luminosity density  . We detect evolution consistent with a   rise to   and   for  . The luminosity density from the most UV\u2010luminous galaxies (UVLGs) is undergoing dramatic evolution (30 times) between  . UVLGs are responsible for a significant fraction (>25%) of the total far\u2010ultraviolet luminosity density at  . We measure dust attenuation and star formation rates of our sample galaxies and determine the star formation rate density ( ) as a function of redshift, both uncorrected and corrected for dust. We find good agreement with other measures of   in the rest ultraviolet and H\u03b1 given the still \u2026",
                "We compare the dust attenuation properties of two samples of galaxies purely selected in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) near\u2010ultraviolet band (NUV; 1750\u20132750 \u00c5,   \u00c5) and in the far\u2010infrared (FIR) at 60 \u03bcm. These samples are built using the GALEX and IRAS sky surveys over \u223c600 deg2. The NUV\u2010selected sample contains 95 galaxies detected down to   mag (AB system). Eighty\u2010three galaxies in this sample are spiral or irregular, and only two of them are not detected at 60 \u03bcm. The FIR\u2010selected sample is built from the IRAS PSCz survey, which is complete down to 0.6 Jy. Among the 163 sources, we select 118 star\u2010forming galaxies that are well measured by IRAS; all but one are detected in NUV, and 14 galaxies are not detected in the far\u2010ultraviolet band (FUV; 1350\u20131750 \u00c5,   \u00c5). The dust\u2010to\u2010ultraviolet (NUV and FUV) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate the dust attenuation at both wavelengths. The \u2026",
                "We report the first year's on\u2010orbit performance results for the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Small Explorer that is performing a survey of the sky in two ultraviolet bands. The instrument comprises a 50 cm diameter modified Ritchey\u2010Chr\u00e9tien telescope with a 1 25 field of view, selectable imaging and objective\u2010grism spectroscopic modes, and an innovative optical system with a thin\u2010film multilayer dichroic beam splitter that enables simultaneous imaging by a pair of photon\u2010counting, microchannel\u2010plate, delay\u2010line readout detectors. Initial measurements demonstrate that GALEX is performing well, meeting its requirements for resolution, efficiency, astrometry, bandpass definition, and survey sensitivity.",
                "We have used the Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV photometric data to construct a first near\u2010UV (NUV) color\u2010magnitude relation (CMR) for the galaxies preclassified as early\u2010type by Sloan Digital Sky Survey studies. The NUV CMR is a powerful tool for tracking the recent star formation history in early\u2010type galaxies, owing to its high sensitivity to the presence of young stellar populations. Our NUV CMR for UV\u2010weak galaxies shows a well\u2010defined slope and thus will be useful for interpreting the rest\u2010frame NUV data of distant galaxies and studying their star formation history. Compared to optical CMRs, the NUV CMR shows a substantially larger scatter, which we interpret as evidence of recent star formation activities. Roughly 15% of the recent epoch ( ) bright [ ] early\u2010type galaxies show a sign of recent (\u22721 Gyr) star formation at the 1%\u20132% level (lower limit) in mass compared to the total stellar mass. This implies that \u2026",
                "Ultraviolet imaging with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) has revealed an extensive sample of UV\u2010bright stellar complexes in the extreme outer disk of M83, extending to about 4 times the radius at which the majority of H ii regions are detected ( , or 6.6 kpc). These sources are typically associated with large\u2010scale filamentary H i structures in the warped outer disk of M83 and are distributed beyond the galactocentric radii at which molecular interstellar medium has yet been detected. We present measured properties of these stellar complexes, including far\u2010UV and near\u2010UV magnitudes and local gas surface density. Only a subset of the outer\u2010disk UV sources have corresponding H ii regions detected in H\u03b1 imaging, consistent with a sample of mixed age in which some sources are a few megayears old and others are much more evolved (\u223c108 yr).",
                "We present the results of a determination of the galaxy luminosity function at ultraviolet wavelengths at redshifts of   from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data. We determined the luminosity function in the GALEX far\u2010UV and near\u2010UV bands from a sample of galaxies with UV magnitudes between 17 and 20 that are drawn from a total of 56.73 deg2 of GALEX fields overlapping the  \u2010selected Two\u2010Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. The resulting luminosity functions are fainter than previous UV estimates and result in total UV luminosity densities of   and   ergs s\u22121 Hz\u22121 Mpc\u22123 at 1530 and 2310 \u00c5, respectively. This corresponds to a local star formation rate density in agreement with previous estimates made with H\u03b1\u2010selected data for reasonable assumptions about the UV extinction.",
                "We investigate threshold pion photoproduction in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We give the expansion of the electric dipole amplitude E 0+ to three orders in \u03bc the ratio of the pion to nucleon mass, and show that it is slowly converging. We argue that this observable is not a good testing ground for the chiral dynamics of QCD. In contrast, we exhibit new and fastly converging low-energy theorems in the P-waves which should be used to constrain the data analysis. We also discuss the importance of polarization observables to accurately pin down certain multipoles and give predictions for the reaction \u03b3 n \u2192 \u03c00 n."
