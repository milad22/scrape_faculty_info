                "This article discusses fluctuating order in a quantum disordered phase proximate to a quantum critical point, with particular emphasis on fluctuating stripe order. Optimal strategies are derived for extracting information concerning such local order from experiments, with emphasis on neutron scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy. These ideas are tested by application to two model systems\u2014an exactly solvable one-dimensional (1D) electron gas with an impurity, and a weakly interacting 2D electron gas. Experiments on the cuprate high-temperature superconductors which can be analyzed using these strategies are extensively reviewed. The authors adduce evidence that stripe correlations are widespread in the cuprates. They compare and contrast the advantages of two limiting perspectives on the high-temperature superconductor: weak coupling, in which correlation effects are treated as a perturbation on \u2026",
                "Angle-resolved photoemission experiments reveal evidence of an energy gap in the normal state excitation spectrum of the cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4. This gap exists only in underdoped samples and closes around the doping level at which the superconducting transition temperature Tc is a maximum. The momentum dependence and magnitude of the gap closely resemble those of the dx2\u2212y2 gap observed in the superconducting state. This observation is consistent with results from several other experimental techniques, which also indicate the presence of a gap in the normal state. Some possible theoretical explanations for this effect are reviewed.",
                "Superconducting gap anisotropy at least an order of magnitude larger than that of the conventional superconductors has been observed in the a-b plane of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. For samples with T c of 88 K, the gap size reaches a maximum of approximately 20 meV along the Cu-O bond direction, and a minimum of much smaller or vanishing magnitude 45 away. The experimental data are discussed within the context of various theoretical models. In particular, a detailed comparison with what is expected from a superconductor with a d x 2-y 2 order parameter is carried out, yielding a consistent picture.",
                "We report angle-resolved photoemission results on Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 1\u2212 x Dy x Cu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 and oxygen depleted Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 investigating the electronic structure changes above T c in materials with hole doping levels ranging from insulating to slightly overdoped. Near optimal hole doping, the Fermi surface is large and consistent with band calculations. In underdoped samples with T c of 60\u201370 K, portions of this Fermi surface are not seen. This change is related to the opening of an energy gap near (\u03c0, 0) above T c.",
                "The near-E F electronic structure and Fermi surface of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ \u03b4 have been mapped out with angle-resolved photoemission. Key features of the measured band structure are (1) an extended region of flat CuO 2 derived bands very near E F and (2) a strong propensity for Fermi surface nesting. Comparative analysis of these data with those from other cuprate superconductors suggests that these features may be responsible for many of the anomalous physical properties of the p-type cuprates, while the absence of these features may be related to the more \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019physical properties of the n types.",
                "Scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies on high-quality Bi 2 Te 3 crystals exhibit perfect correspondence to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, hence enabling identification of different regimes measured in the local density of states (LDOS). Oscillations of LDOS near a step are analyzed. Within the main part of the surface band oscillations are strongly damped, supporting the hypothesis of topological protection. At higher energies, as the surface band becomes concave, oscillations appear, dispersing with a wave vector that may result from a hexagonal warping term.",
                "The polar Kerr effect in the spin-triplet superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 was measured with high precision using a Sagnac interferometer with a zero-area Sagnac loop. We observed nonzero Kerr rotations as big as 65 nanorad appearing below T c in large domains. Our results imply a broken time-reversal symmetry state in the superconducting state of Sr 2 RuO 4, similar to He 3\u2212 A.",
                "The upper critical field H c 2 and fluctuation conductivity were measured for highly oriented thin films of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212 x. The H c 2 results demonstrate the intrinsic anisotropy in this layered superconductor. The broadening of the resistive transition under fields is interpreted in terms of critical fluctuations. The fluctuation conductivity shows dimensional crossover as expected for quasi-two-dimensional material. Using this data we determine the intra-and interlayer coherence lengths \u03be c (0) and \u03be ab (0), and discuss the dimensionality of the superconductivity in this material.",
                "A zero-temperature magnetic-field-tuned superconducting-insulating transition is observed in two-dimensional a-MoGe films. The low temperature transport properties of these films show scaling behavior consistent with a transition driven by long-range Coulomb interactions and quantum phase fluctuations in a two-dimensional superconductor. However, contrary to the theoretical predictions we find the critical resistance to be sample dependent. We suggest that the apparent lack of universality in the critical resistance is due to the finite contribution of fermionic excitations to the resistance.",
                "The magnetic field dependence of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N (E F, H), is determined in single-crystal Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 by specific heat measurements. The total specific heat is best described by including two predictions for the electronic specific heat of d-wave superconductivity: a T 2 term in zero field and an increased linear term in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Cu O 2 planes. The additional linear term, which implies a finite N (E F, H), obeys N (E F, H)\u221d(H H c 2) 1 2 as predicted by Volovik for superconductivity with lines of nodes in the gap."
