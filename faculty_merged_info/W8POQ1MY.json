                "Dr. Alexandra Landsman Dr. Alexandra Landsman Dr. Alexandra Landsman Associate Professor landsman.7@osu.edu Our group studies the ensuing dynamics when ultrashort light shines on atoms, molecules and condensed matter systems.\u00a0 These ultra-short flashes of light are on a time scale of\u00a0attoseconds\u00a0(10^(-18) seconds) to\u00a0femtoseconds (10^(-15) seconds) , which is fast enough to capture the motion of bound electrons inside matter.\u00a0 To quote the 2018 Nobel Prize Physics website:\u00a0 \u201cExtremely small objects and incredibly fast processes now appear in a new light.\u201d\u00a0 The ultimate goal is accurate imaging and control of electron dynamics on the attosecond time-scale. We use variety of numerical and analytic methods, ranging from the solution of the Schrodinger equation to classical and semiclassical approaches to techniques from nonlinear dynamical systems."
