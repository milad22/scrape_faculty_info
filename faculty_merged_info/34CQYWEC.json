His M.Sc. thesis was based on research performed on two-pion correlations in proton-proton collision and simulations of two-particle correlations for ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Chajecki\u2019s Ph.D. thesis focused on global conservation laws and two-particle correlations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. He then worked as a research associate at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. Chajecki\u2019s research specialty is in experimental nuclear physics focusing on the equation of state of dense nuclear matter that should help us better understand the physics of neutron stars. Recently, he initiated a program to study fission of exotic nuclei that he will perform at the NSCL and in the future at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams. Email Zbigniew Chajecki"
