                "The cooling of hot electrons in graphene is the critical process underlying the operation of exciting new graphene-based optoelectronic and plasmonic devices, but the nature of this cooling is controversial. We extract the hot-electron cooling rate near the Fermi level by using graphene as a novel photothermal thermometer that measures the electron temperature (T (t)) as it cools dynamically. We find the photocurrent generated from graphene p\u2013n junctions is well described by the energy dissipation rate CdT\/dt=\u2212 A (T 3\u2212 T l 3), where the heat capacity is C= \u03b1 T and T l is the base lattice temperature. These results are in disagreement with predictions of electron\u2013phonon emission in a disorder-free graphene system, but in excellent quantitative agreement with recent predictions of a disorder-enhanced supercollision cooling mechanism. We find that the supercollision model provides a complete and unified picture of \u2026",
                "We study the origin of the spectral line shape in colloidal CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots. The three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS) data reveal a temperature-independent fast decay, obscuring the quantification of the homogeneous linewidth. The optical gap and Stokes shift are found to have an anomalous behavior with temperature, which is size, capping group, and surrounding polymer matrix independent. Using these results and combining them with simulations, we discuss the role of exciton-phonon coupling, static inhomogeneity, exciton fine structure, and exciton state disorder in the linewidth of the nanocrystal. In particular, our analysis shows that the disorder due to surface imperfections and finite temperature effects, as well as the relaxation within the fine structure, can have significant impact on the steady-state absorption spectrum, 3PEPS data, and dephasing processes.",
                "The ability to control the stacking structure in layered materials could provide an exciting approach to tuning their optical and electronic properties. Because of the lower symmetry of each constituent monolayer, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows more structural variations in multiple layers than graphene; however, the structure\u2013property relationships in this system remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a strong correlation between the interlayer stacking structures and optical and topological properties in chemically grown h-BN bilayers, measured mainly by using dark-field transmission electron microscopy (DF-TEM) and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) mapping. Our data show that there exist two distinct h-BN bilayer structures with different interlayer symmetries that give rise to a distinct difference in their SHG intensities. In particular, the SHG signal in h-BN bilayers is observed only for \u2026",
                "Femtosecond two-pulse degenerate four-wave mixing spectroscopy was applied to study the exciton dephasing in a broad range of excitation intensities and lattice temperatures. We find that both exciton-exciton and exciton-phonon scattering have profound effects on the dephasing process. The dominant phonon mode involved in the dephasing is identified as the out-of-plane, transverse optical mode with a frequency of 847 cm\u2212 1. The extracted homogeneous linewidths at all measured temperatures are in excellent agreement with the results of a single-tube photoluminescence experiment.",
                "Using transient absorption (TA) microscopy as a hot electron thermometer, we show that disorder-assisted acoustic-phonon supercollisions (SCs) best describe the rate-limiting relaxation step in graphene over a wide range of lattice temperatures (Tl = 5\u2013300 K), Fermi energies (EF = \u00b1 0.35 eV), and optical probe energies (\u223c0.3\u20131.1 eV). Comparison with simultaneously collected transient photocurrent, an independent hot electron thermometer, confirms that the rate-limiting optical and electrical response in graphene are best described by the SC-heat dissipation rate model, H = A(Te3 \u2013 Tl3). Our data further show that the electron cooling rate in substrate-supported graphene is twice as fast as in suspended graphene sheets, consistent with SC model prediction for disorder.",
                "We report a detailed study of ultrafast exciton dephasing processes in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes employing a sample highly enriched in a single tube species, the (6,5) tube. Systematic measurements of femtosecond pump\u2013probe, two-pulse photon echo, and three-pulse photon echo peak shift over a broad range of excitation intensities and lattice temperature (from 4.4 to 292 K) enable us to quantify the timescales of pure optical dephasing (T2*), along with exciton\u2013exciton and exciton\u2013phonon scattering, environmental effects as well as spectral diffusion. While the exciton dephasing time (T2) increases from 205 fs at room temperature to 320 fs at 70 K, we found that further decrease of the lattice temperature leads to a shortening of the T2 times. This complex temperature dependence was found to arise from an enhanced relaxation of exciton population at lattice temperatures below 80 K. By \u2026",
                "Three-pulse photon echo peak shift measurements were performed on semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes embedded in polymer matrix at room temperature. Simultaneous modeling of the peak shift data in the limit of zero-intensity and the linear absorption spectrum enable us to extract an intrinsic homogeneous line width of 178 cm\u22121, an inhomogeneous width of 698 cm\u22121, and a Huang\u2212Rhys factor of 0.04 for the radial breathing mode vibration. The peak shift data when combined with two-pulse photon echo and pump\u2212probe measurements allows us to determine a pure exciton dephasing time scale of 78 fs at room temperature.",
                "When two sheets of graphene stack in a twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) configuration, the resulting constrained overlap between interplanar 2p orbitals produce angle-tunable electronic absorption resonances. By applying a novel combination of multiphoton transient absorption (TA) microscopy and TEM, we resolve the electronic structure and ensuing relaxation by probing resonant excitations of single tBLG domains. Strikingly, we find that the transient electronic population in resonantly excited tBLG domains is enhanced many fold, forming a major electronic relaxation bottleneck. Two-photon TA microscopy shows this bottleneck effect originates from a strongly bound, dark exciton state lying \u223c0.37 eV below the 1-photon absorption resonance. This stable coexistence of strongly bound excitons alongside free-electron continuum states has not been previously observed in a metallic, 2D material.",
                "The DUNE IDR describes the proposed physics program and technical designs of the DUNE far detector modules in preparation for the full TDR to be published in 2019. It is intended as an intermediate milestone on the path to a full TDR, justifying the technical choices that flow down from the high-level physics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. These design choices will enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that will help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 2 describes the single-phase module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its design, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure.",
                "We report a femtosecond midinfrared study of the broadband low-energy response of individually separated (6, 5) and (7, 5) single-walled carbon nanotubes. Strong photoinduced absorption is observed around 200 meV, whose transition energy, oscillator strength, resonant chirality enhancement, and dynamics manifest the observation of quasi-one-dimensional intraexcitonic transitions. A model of the nanotube 1 s\u2212 2 p cross section agrees well with the signal amplitudes. Our study further reveals saturation of the photoinduced absorption with increasing phase-space filling of the correlated e\u2212 h pairs."
