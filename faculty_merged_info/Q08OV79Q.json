                "The optical response of semiconducting monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is dominated by strongly bound excitons that are stable even at room temperature. However, substrate-related effects such as screening and disorder in currently available specimens mask many anticipated physical phenomena and limit device applications of TMDCs. Here, we demonstrate that that these undesirable effects are strongly suppressed in suspended devices. Extremely robust (photogain> 1,000) and fast (response time< 1 ms) photoresponse allow us to study, for the first time, the formation, binding energies and dissociation mechanisms of excitons in TMDCs through photocurrent spectroscopy. By analyzing the spectral positions of peaks in the photocurrent and by comparing them with first-principles calculations, we obtain binding energies, band gaps and spin-orbit splitting in monolayer TMDCs.

                "Recent work on electronically induced desorption of surface atoms and molecules resulting from the impact of electrons and UV photons with surfaces is reported. Since the overwhelming majority of emitted particles are neutral, emphasis is given to studies of excited and ground state desorbed neutral atoms and molecules. In particular, first measurements of velocity distributions of desorbed particles obtained using laser induced fluorescence are discussed.",

These conditions are satisfied by a universe of form (1) with K= 0 or-1 and filled with nor-mal matter. However, at S, p is positive by a finite amount. Therefore any perturbation of (1) which is not too large will leave p positive, and so there will still be a closed trapped surface and hence a physical singularity. Thus a universe that is similar on a large scale to the form (1) but has no exact local symmetries will have a singularity. Local irregularities cannot prevent it.The presence of matter gives a unique time-like congruence (the flow lines) which may be defined \u2026",
                "The long\u2010term success of photosynthetic organisms has resulted in their global superabundance, which is sustained by their widespread, continual mass\u2010production of the integral proteins that photocatalyze the chemical processes of natural photosynthesis. Here, a fast, general method to assemble multilayer films composed of one such photocatalytic protein complex, Photosystem I (PSI), onto a variety of substrates is reported. The resulting films, akin to the stacked thylakoid structures of leaves, consist of a protein matrix that is permeable to electrochemical mediators and contain a high concentration of photoelectrochemically active redox centers. These multilayer assemblies vastly outperform previously reported monolayer films of PSI in terms of photocurrent production when incorporated into an electrochemical system, and it is shown that these photocatalytic properties increase with the film thickness. These \u2026",
                "Direct evidence for a size effect in self-trapped exciton (STE) photoluminescence (PL) from silica-based nanoscale materials as compared with bulk type-III fused silica is obtained. Two kinds of mesostructures were tested:(1) silica nanoparticle composites with primary particle size of 7 and 15 nm,(2) ordered and disordered mesoporous silicas with pore size ranging from\u223c 2 to\u223c 6 nm and wall thickness\u223c 1 nm. The PL was induced by the two-photon absorption of focused 6.4 eV ArF laser light with intensity\u223c 10 6 W cm\u2212 2 and measured in a time-resolved detection mode. Two models are applied to examine the blue shift of the STE PL (STEPL) band with decreasing size of nanometer-sized silica fragments. The first model is based on the quantum confinement effect on Mott-Wannier-type excitons developed for semiconductor nanoscale materials. However, the use of this model leads to a contradiction showing \u2026",
                "Ultrafast time-resolved differential reflectivity of Bi2Se3 crystals is studied using optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Three distinct relaxation processes are found to contribute to the initial transient reflectivity changes. The deduced relaxation timescale and the sign of the reflectivity change suggest that electron\u2013phonon interactions and defect-induced charge trapping are the underlying mechanisms for the three processes. After the crystal is exposed to air, the relative strength of these processes is altered and becomes strongly dependent on the excitation photon energy.",

                "The lifetime of the stretch mode of bond-center hydrogen in crystalline silicon is measured to be T 1= 7.8\u00b10.2 ps with time-resolved, transient bleaching spectroscopy. The low-temperature spectral width of the absorption line due to the stretch mode converges towards its natural width for decreasing hydrogen concentration C H, and nearly coincides with the natural width for C H\u223c 1 ppm. The lifetimes of the Si-H stretch modes of selected hydrogen-related defects are estimated from their spectral widths and shown to range from 1.6 to more than 37 ps.",
                "Low-energy ion-surface collisions have been observed to result in the emission of optical radiation arising from sputtering with simultaneous excitation. Emission functions have been obtained showing structure and energy thresholds which provide detailed information important in the understanding of this newly observed low-energy phenomenon. These data can be understood in terms of excited-state sputtering efficiencies and radiationless de-excitation processes which compete with radiative de-excitation of the excited states of the sputtered atoms.",
                "Measurements have been performed of the dependence on scattering angle and target orientation of the oscillatory structure recently observed in low-energy ion scattering from surfaces. Wide variation is exhibited in the behavior of oscillation maxima as a function of scattering angle depending on the target species studied. A semiquantitative model is presented which treats the phenomenon in terms of quantum mechanical phase interference between pairs of near-resonant quasimolecular levels."
