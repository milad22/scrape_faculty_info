                "The electronic bandgap is an intrinsic property of semiconductors and insulators that largely determines their transport and optical properties. As such, it has a central role in modern device physics and technology and governs the operation of semiconductor devices such as p\u2013n junctions, transistors, photodiodes and lasers 1. A tunable bandgap would be highly desirable because it would allow great flexibility in design and optimization of such devices, in particular if it could be tuned by applying a variable external electric field. However, in conventional materials, the bandgap is fixed by their crystalline structure, preventing such bandgap control. Here we demonstrate the realization of a widely tunable electronic bandgap in electrically gated bilayer graphene. Using a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET) 2 and infrared microspectroscopy 3, 4, 5, we demonstrate a gate-controlled, continuously \u2026",
                "A method for confining electrons to artificial structures at the nanometer lengthscale is presented. Surface state electrons on a copper(111) surface were confined to closed structures (corrals) defined by barriers built from iron adatoms. The barriers were assembled by individually positioning iron adatoms with the tip of a 4-kelvin scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A circular corral of radius 71.3 \u00c5 was constructed in this way out of 48 iron adatoms. Tunneling spectroscopy performed inside of the corral revealed a series of discrete resonances, providing evidence for size quantization. STM images show that the corral9s interior local density of states is dominated by the eigenstate density expected for an electron trapped in a round two-dimensional box.",
                "Two-dimensional graphene monolayers and bilayers exhibit fascinating electrical transport behaviors. Using infrared spectroscopy, we find that they also have strong interband transitions and that their optical transitions can be substantially modified through electrical gating, much like electrical transport in field-effect transistors. This gate dependence of interband transitions adds a valuable dimension for optically probing graphene band structure. For a graphene monolayer, it yields directly the linear band dispersion of Dirac fermions, whereas in a bilayer, it reveals a dominating van Hove singularity arising from interlayer coupling. The strong and layer-dependent optical transitions of graphene and the tunability by simple electrical gating hold promise for new applications in infrared optics and optoelectronics.",
                "ELECTRONS occupying surface states on the close-packed surfaces of noble metals form a two-dimensional nearly free electron gas 1\u20133. These states can be probed using the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), providing a unique opportunity to study the local properties of electrons in low-dimensional systems 4. Here we report the direct observation of standing-wave patterns in the local density of states of the Cu (lll) surface using the STM at low temperature. These spatial oscillations are quantum-mechanical interference patterns caused by scattering of the two-dimensional electron gas off step edges and point defects. Analysis of the spatial oscillations gives an independent measure of the surface state dispersion, as well as insight into the interaction between surface-state electrons and scattering sites on the surface.",
                "Recent theoretical proposals suggest that strain can be used to engineer graphene electronic states through the creation of a pseudo\u2013magnetic field. This effect is unique to graphene because of its massless Dirac fermion-like band structure and particular lattice symmetry (C3v). Here, we present experimental spectroscopic measurements by scanning tunneling microscopy of highly strained nanobubbles that form when graphene is grown on a platinum (111) surface. The nanobubbles exhibit Landau levels that form in the presence of strain-induced pseudo\u2013magnetic fields greater than 300 tesla. This demonstration of enormous pseudo\u2013magnetic fields opens the door to both the study of charge carriers in previously inaccessible high magnetic field regimes and deliberate mechanical control over electronic structure in graphene or so-called \u201cstrain engineering.\u201d",
                "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron\u2013electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe 2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe 2 on graphene\u2014orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than \u2026",
                "Although the physics of materials at surfaces and edges has been extensively studied, the movement of individual atoms at an isolated edge has not been directly observed in real time. With a transmission electron aberration\u2013corrected microscope capable of simultaneous atomic spatial resolution and 1-second temporal resolution, we produced movies of the dynamics of carbon atoms at the edge of a hole in a suspended, single atomic layer of graphene. The rearrangement of bonds and beam-induced ejection of carbon atoms are recorded as the hole grows. We investigated the mechanism of edge reconstruction and demonstrated the stability of the \u201czigzag\u201d edge configuration. This study of an ideal low-dimensional interface, a hole in graphene, exhibits the complex behavior of atoms at a boundary.",
                "We present a transmission electron microscopy investigation of graphene membranes, crystalline foils with a thickness of only 1 atom. By using aberration-correction in combination with a monochromator, 1-\u00c5 resolution is achieved at an acceleration voltage of only 80 kV. The low voltage is crucial for the stability of these membranes. As a result, every individual carbon atom in the field of view is detected and resolved. We observe a highly crystalline lattice along with occasional point defects. The formation and annealing of Stone\u2212Wales defects is observed in situ. Multiple five- and seven-membered rings appear exclusively in combinations that avoid dislocations and disclinations, in contrast to previous observations on highly curved (tube- or fullerene-like) graphene surfaces.",
                "The Kondo effect arises from the quantum mechanical interplay between the electrons of a host metal and a magnetic impurity and is predicted to result in local charge and spin variations around the magnetic impurity. A cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope was used to spatially resolve the electronic properties of individual magnetic atoms displaying the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic measurements performed on individual cobalt atoms on the surface of gold show an energetically narrow feature that is identified as the Kondo resonance\u2014the predicted response of a Kondo impurity. Unexpected structure in the Kondo resonance is shown to arise from quantum mechanical interference between the d orbital and conduction electron channels for an electron tunneling into a magnetic atom in a metallic host.",
                "We introduce a new type of liquid cell for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based on entrapment of a liquid film between layers of graphene. The graphene liquid cell facilitates atomic-level resolution imaging while sustaining the most realistic liquid conditions achievable under electron-beam radiation. We employ this cell to explore the mechanism of colloidal platinum nanocrystal growth. Direct atomic-resolution imaging allows us to visualize critical steps in the process, including site-selective coalescence, structural reshaping after coalescence, and surface faceting."

                "Michael Crommie Michael Crommie 345 Birge crommie@physics.berkeley.edu The Crommie Group Mike Crommie received a B.S. degree in physics from UCLA in 1984 and his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1991. He was a post-doc at IBM Almaden for two years before becoming an Assistant Professor in the Physics Dept. at Boston University in 1994. He moved his laboratory to the UC Berkeley Physics Dept. in 6\/99 and joined the Berkeley faculty as an Associate Professor. Awards and honors include a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (1994), the AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize for 1993-94, and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship (1997). My main research interests lie in exploring the local electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of atomic and molecular structures at surfaces. I am interested in studying how local interactions between atomic-scale structures affect their microscopic behavior, and how quantum mechanical effects might influence nanodevice behavior in very small structures. My main experimental tool is scanned probe microscopy, which can be used in combination with other experimental tools to both fabricate atomic-scale structures and probe them spectroscopically. Atomic manipulation: The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to position individual atoms and molecules on a conducting surface, allowing the fabrication of precise atomic-scale structures. We have several instruments capable of performing atomic and molecular manipulation, and we are currently exploring the physical parameters necessary to controllably position atoms and molecules into new and useful nanoscale configurations. Carbon Nanostructures: Recent advances in synthesis have made it possible to fabricate whole new classes of carbon nanostructures such as buckyballs, endohedral fullerenes, nanotubes, and single sheets of graphene. These materials are extremely flexible and hold great promise for new generations of nanodevices. My group is using scanned probe techniques to explore and modify the properties of these materials at the single atom \/ single molecule level. Some of our successes include the first energy-resolved mapping of a single buckyball, single-atom electronic doping of an individual C60 molecule, mapping electron-phonon coupling strength across the surface of a single endohedral fullerene, and the first atomically-resolved spectroscopy of a single layer of graphene. Future projects will include exploring atomic-scale modification of carbon nanostructures and investigation of their device potential. Spin-based Nanostructures: When magnetic structures are shrunk down to single-atom or single-molecule sizes, then quantum spin effects dominate their behavior. This is a particularly fascinating regime in condensed matter, where individual spins can interact with the excitations of the condensed matter environment. Much of the interest in this area derives from its great promise for revolutionary applications in spintronics and quantum information. My group is using scanned probe techniques to explore individual magnetic atoms, small spin clusters, and magnetic molecules. Some of our successes here include the first spectroscopic characterization of a single Kondo impurity, exploration of coupled systems of two and three atomic spins at a surface, and the first spin-polarized measurement of a single magnetic adatom. We are currently exploring spin-polarized atomic-scale structures and coupled magnetic molecule systems with an eye toward quantum information applications. Molecular Machines: Molecular machines are well-known to exist in the biological realm, but it has proved difficult to control the mechanical behavior of synthetically fabricated machines at truly molecular scales. Nevertheless, this is a very promising direction with many exciting NEMS applications (Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems). In my group we are interested in creating molecular machines from the ground up by assembling and actuating molecular-mechanical building blocks. One of our successes includes the first observation of reversible optically-actuated mechanical switching of a single molecule (azobenzene) at a surface. We are currently exploring the physics of new molecular systems whose electro-mechanical state can be remotely switched, and our goal is to assemble these into functional molecular machines at small lengthscales. Nano-photovoltaics: Current state-of-the-art solar cells require carefully processed semiconducting interfaces that extend over macroscopic distances (i.e., extended n-p junctions). An alternative method for creating solar cells, however, is to engineer nanoscale elements that can be combined to create microscopic n-p junctions. These can then be combined in large quantities to create composite photovoltaics with spatially distributed n-p interfaces. A benefit of this approach is that such nano-photovoltaic building blocks can be mass-produced cheaply and so this technique is potentially more scalable than current state-of-the-art semiconductor photovoltaics. The down side is that nano-photovoltaics currently have very low efficiencies. My group is currently exploring the microscopic physics of nano-photovoltaic interfaces, with the goal of understanding and optimizing the processes that allow us to convert sunlight into usable electrical energy in molecular-scale structures. \"Observing Spin Polarization of Individual Magnetic Adatoms\", by Y.
