                " A reverberation\u2010mapping program on NGC 4395, the least luminous known Seyfert 1 galaxy, undertaken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope yields a measurement of the mass of the central black hole   M\u2299. The observations consist of two visits of five orbits each, in 2004 April and July. During each of these visits, the UV continuum varied by at least 10% (rms), and only C iv \u03bb1549 showed corresponding variations large enough to reliably determine the emission\u2010line lag, which was measured to be of order 1 hr for both visits. The size of the C iv\u2013emitting region is about a factor of 3 smaller than expected if the slope of the broad\u2010line region radius\u2010luminosity relationship is identical to that for the H\u03b2 emission line. NGC 4395 is underluminous even for its small black hole mass; the Eddington ratio of \u223c  is lower than that of any other active galactic nucleus for which a \u2026",
                "We present high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images of all 35 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with optical reverberation-mapping results, which we have modeled to create a nucleus-free image of each AGN host galaxy. From the nucleus-free images, we determine the host-galaxy contribution to ground-based spectroscopic luminosity measurements at 5100 \u00c5. After correcting the luminosities of the AGNs for the contribution from starlight, we re-examine the H\u03b2 R BLR-L relationship. Our best fit for the relationship gives a power-law slope of 0.52 with a range of 0.45-0.59 allowed by the uncertainties. This is consistent with our previous findings, and thus still consistent with the naive assumption that all AGNs are simply luminosity-scaled versions of each other. We discuss various consistency checks relating to the galaxy modeling and starlight contributions, as well as possible systematic errors in the current set \u2026",
                "We present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between the H\u03b2 broad-line region (BLR) radius and the luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of nine new AGNs imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow us to create\" AGN-free\" images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the H\u03b2 time lag, which is assumed to yield the average H\u03b2 BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity. The additions and updates incorporated here primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R BLR-L relationship \u2026",
                "We have obtained high\u2010resolution images of the central regions of 14 reverberation\u2010mapped active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys High Resolution Camera to account for host\u2010galaxy starlight contamination of measured AGN luminosities. We measure the host\u2010galaxy starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity at 5100 \u00c5 through the typical ground\u2010based slit position and geometry used in the reverberation\u2010mapping campaigns. We find that removing the starlight contribution results in a significant correction to the luminosity of each AGN both for lower luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well\u2010known broad\u2010line region radius\u2010luminosity relationship for nearby AGNs. We find the power\u2010law slope of the relationship for the H\u03b2 line to \u2026",
                "We have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses of the black holes in 12 nearby (z< 0.05) Seyfert 1 galaxies with expected masses in the range~ 10 6-10 7 M\u2609 and also the well-studied nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad H\u03b2 emission. We present here the light curves for all the objects in this sample and the subsequent H\u03b2 time lags for the nine objects where these measurements were possible. The H\u03b2 lag time is directly related to the size of the broad-line region (BLR) in AGNs, and by combining the H\u03b2 lag time with the measured \u2026",
                "We present the final results from a high sampling rate, multi-month, spectrophotometric reverberation mapping campaign undertaken to obtain either new or improved H\u03b2 reverberation lag measurements for several relatively low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We have reliably measured the time delay between variations in the continuum and H\u03b2 emission line in six local Seyfert 1 galaxies. These measurements are used to calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of each of these AGNs. We place our results in context to the most current calibration of the broad-line region (BLR) R BLR-L relationship, where our results remove outliers and reduce the scatter at the low-luminosity end of this relationship. We also present velocity-resolved H\u03b2 time-delay measurements for our complete sample, though the clearest velocity-resolved kinematic signatures have already been published.",
                "To investigate the black hole mass versus stellar velocity dispersion (M BH-\u03c3*) relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions of a sample of local Seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined black hole masses using reverberation mapping. For most objects, stellar velocity dispersions were measured from high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra centered on the Ca II triplet region (~ 8500 \u00c5), obtained at the Keck, Palomar, and Lick Observatories. For two objects, in which the Ca II triplet region was contaminated by nuclear emission, the measurement was based on high-quality H-band spectra obtained with the OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph at the Keck-II telescope. Combining our new measurements with data from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based black hole mass measurements in \u2026",
                "The commissioning year of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has demonstrated that many cataclysmic variables (CVs) have been missed in previous surveys with brighter limits. We report the identification of 22 CVs, of which 19 are new discoveries and three are known systems (SW UMa, BH Lyn, and OU Vir). A compendium of positions, colors, and characteristics of these systems obtained from the SDSS photometry and spectroscopy is presented, along with data obtained during follow-up studies with the Apache Point Observatory and Manastash Ridge Observatory telescopes. We have determined orbital periods for three of the new systems, two show dwarf nova outbursts, and the third is a likely magnetic system with eclipses of its region of line emission. Based on these results, we expect the completed survey to locate at least 400 new CVs. Most of these will be faint systems with low accretion rates that will \u2026",
                "We have undertaken a new ground\u2010based monitoring campaign to improve the estimates of the mass of the central black hole in NGC 4151. We measure the lag time of the broad H\u03b2 line response compared to the optical continuum at 5100 \u00c5 and find a lag of   days. We combine our data with the recent reanalysis of UV emission lines by Metzroth and coworkers to calculate a weighted mean of the black hole mass,  . The absolute calibration of the black hole mass is based on normalization of the AGN black hole mass\u2010stellar velocity dispersion (MBH\u2010\u03c3*) relationship to that of quiescent galaxies by Onken and coworkers. The scatter in the MBH\u2010\u03c3* relationship suggests that reverberation\u2010mapping\u2010based mass measurements are typically uncertain by a factor of 3\u20134.",
                "The AGN Black Hole Mass Database is a compilation of all published spectroscopic reverberation-mapping studies of active galaxies. We have created a public Web interface where users may get the most up-to-date black hole masses from reverberation mapping for any particular active galactic nucleus (AGN), as well as obtain the individual measurements upon which the masses are based and the appropriate references. While the database currently focuses on the measurements necessary for black hole mass determinations, we also plan to expand it in the future to include additional useful information, such as host-galaxy characteristics. New reverberation mapping results will also be incorporated into the database as they are published in peer-refereed journals."
