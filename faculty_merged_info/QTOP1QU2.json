                "John Page - Professor Emeritus John Page\u2019s current research involves two broad areas: (1) Analytic and numerical studies of a novel class of stationary localized vibrational excitations in strongly anharmonic perfect lattices. The localization results from the interplay between nonlinearity and lattice discreteness. Recent extensions to systems as diverse as optically driven lattices of electric dipole rotors and quasi-1D lattices of Josephson junctions subject to applied DC currents reveal a wide variety of fascinating behavior. (2) Collaborative studies of the structural, dynamical and electronic properties of fullerene molecules and solids, e.g. C60 \u201cbuckyballs,\u201d polymerized fullerene lattices, and carbon nanotubes. Accurate large-scale simulations are carried out, and the results are compared with infrared absorption and Raman scattering experiments performed at ASU and elsewhere.

Additional research areas are the theory of resonance Raman scattering from vibronic systems; phonons, electron-phonon coupling and optical properties of defect lattices.
