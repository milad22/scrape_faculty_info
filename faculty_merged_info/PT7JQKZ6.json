                "Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of superconducting BaFe 1.84 Co 0.16 As 2 reveal a magnetic excitation located at wave vectors (1\/2 1\/2 L) in tetragonal notation. On cooling below T C, a clear resonance peak is observed at this wave vector with an energy of 8.6 (0.5) meV, corresponding to 4.5 (0.3) k B T C. This is in good agreement with the canonical value of 5 k B T C observed in the cuprates. The spectrum shows strong dispersion in the tetragonal plane but very weak dispersion along the c axis, indicating that the magnetic fluctuations are two dimensional in nature. This is in sharp contrast to the anisotropic three dimensional spin excitations seen in the undoped parent compounds.",
                "Many correlated electron materials, such as high-temperature superconductors 1, geometrically frustrated oxides 2 and low-dimensional magnets 3, 4, are still objects of fruitful study because of the unique properties that arise owing to poorly understood many-body effects. Heavy-fermion metals 5\u2014materials that have high effective electron masses due to those effects\u2014represent a class of materials with exotic properties, ranging from unusual magnetism, unconventional superconductivity and \u2018hidden\u2019order parameters 6. The heavy-fermion superconductor URu 2 Si 2 has held the attention of physicists for the past two decades owing to the presence of a \u2018hidden-order\u2019phase below 17.5 K. Neutron scattering measurements indicate that the ordered moment is 0.03\u03bc B, much too small to account for the large heat-capacity anomaly at 17.5 K. We present recent neutron scattering experiments that unveil a new piece of \u2026",
                "We report neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of BaFe 1.92 Co 0.08 As 2. The magnetic Bragg peak intensity is reduced by 6% upon cooling through T C. The spin dynamics exhibit a gap of 8 meV with anisotropic three-dimensional interactions. Below T C additional intensity appears at an energy of\u223c 4.5 (0.5) meV, similar to previous observations of a spin resonance in other Fe-based superconductors. No further gapping of the spin excitations is observed below T C for energies down to 2 meV. These observations suggest the redistribution of spectral weight from the magnetic Bragg position to a spin resonance, demonstrating the direct competition between static magnetic order and superconductivity.",
                "The origin of the superconducting state in the recently discovered Fe-based materials 1, 2, 3 is the subject of intense scrutiny. Neutron scattering 4, 5, 6, 7 and NMR (ref. 8) measurements have already demonstrated a strong correlation between magnetism and superconductivity. A central unanswered question concerns the nature of the normal-state spin fluctuations that may be responsible for the pairing. Here we present inelastic neutron scattering measurements from large single crystals of superconducting and non-superconducting Fe 1+ y Te 1\u2212 x Se x. These measurements indicate a spin fluctuation spectrum dominated by two-dimensional incommensurate excitations extending to energies greater than 250 meV. Most importantly, the spin excitations in Fe 1+ y Te 1\u2212 x Se x have four-fold symmetry about the (1, 0) wavevector (square-lattice (\u03c0, \u03c0) point). Moreover, the excitations are described by the identical \u2026",
                "Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum\u2010resolved electron energy\u2010loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T\u2010TiSe2. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in \u2026",
                "Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at zero temperature are generally studied by means of pressure or composition tuning. Volume-integrated probes such as neutron and magnetization measurements, as well as pressure uncertainties in NMR studies using powder specimens, however, have limited the characterization of magnetism and detection of discontinuous changes at QPTs. Overcoming these limitations, we carried out muon spin relaxation measurements that have a unique sensitivity to volume fractions of magnetically ordered and paramagnetic regions, and studied QPTs from itinerant helimagnet or ferromagnet to paramagnet transitions in MnSi (single crystal; varying pressure) and (Sr 1\u2212 x Ca x) RuO 3 (ceramic specimens; varying x). Our results provide the first clear evidence that both cases are associated with phase separation and suppression of dynamic critical behaviour, reveal slow dynamics of the \u2026",

                "Superconductivity in so-called unconventional superconductors is nearly always found in the vicinity of another ordered state, such as antiferromagnetism, charge density wave (CDW), or stripe order. This suggests a fundamental connection between superconductivity and fluctuations in some other order parameter. To better understand this connection, we used high-pressure X-ray scattering to directly study the CDW order in the layered dichalcogenide TiSe 2, which was previously shown to exhibit superconductivity when the CDW is suppressed by pressure 1 or intercalation of Cu atoms 2. We succeeded in suppressing the CDW fully to zero temperature, establishing for the first time the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) at P c= 5.1\u00b10.2 GPa, which is more than 1 GPa beyond the end of the superconducting region. Unexpectedly, at P= 3 GPa we observed a reentrant, weakly first order, incommensurate \u2026",
                "Muon spin relaxation measurements in iron-oxypnictide systems have revealed:(1) commensurate long-range order in undoped LaFeAsO;(2) a Bessel function line shape in LaFeAs (O 0.97 F 0.03) which indicates possible incommensurate or stripe magnetism;(3) anomalous weak magnetism existing in superconducting LaFePO, CeFeAs (O 0.084 F 0.16), and NdFeAs (O 0.88 F 0.12) but absent in superconducting LaFeAs (O 0.92 F 0.08); and (4) scaling of the superfluid density with T c in the Ce-, La-, and Nd-FeAs superconductors following a nearly linear relationship found in cuprates.",
                "We have performed zero-field muon-spin-relaxation measurements on single crystals of La 2\u2212 x Sr x CuO 4 to search for spontaneous currents in the pseudogap state. By comparing measurements on materials across the phase diagram, we put strict upper limits on any possible time-reversal symmetry breaking fields that could be associated with the pseudogap. Comparison between experimental limits and the proposed circulating current states effectively eliminates the possibility that such states exist in this family of materials."

                "Gregory MacDougall Research Assistant Professor 408 Materials Research Lab (217) 300-0147 gmacdoug@illinois.edu Professor Gregory MacDougall received a bachelor's degree in mathematical physics from Simon Fraser University in 2002 and a Ph.D. in physics from McMaster University in 2008. His doctoral research focused on exploring the magnetic properties of unconventional superconductors using techniques such as \\muSR, magnetometry and neutron scattering. Professor MacDougall went on to work in the Quantum Condensed Matter Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. There he used primarily neutron scattering facilities at the Spallation Neutron Source and the High-Flux Isotope Reactor to explore material properties of frustrated antiferromagnets, high-temperature superconductors and thin-film multiferroics. Throughout his research career, Professor MacDougall has maintained a healthy interest in the growth of large single crystals of novel compounds. Research Interests spin-orbital and spin-lattice coupling orbital order magnetic frustration superconductivity magnetic fluctuations emergent magnetism Professor MacDougall's research involves the exploration of emergent magnetic properties of novel materials using probes such as neutron scattering and muon spin rotation (muSR). His work at UIUC additionally includes the synthesis of novel compounds and the growth of large single crystals. Problems of current interest include orbital order, the effects of magnetic frustration, the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in correlated materials, and the coupling between spin, charge and lattice degrees-of-freedom in condensed matter systems. Projects in this group are varied, but will likely include aspects of materials development, crystal growth and characterization, and the execution of neutron scattering or muSR experiments at national laboratories.
