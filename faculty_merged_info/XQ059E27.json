Physics, Cornell University (1986) B.S. Physics, Davidson College (1980) Web Links Personal Home Page PER News Research Page Teaching Page Curriculum Development Page I do research of students' qualitative and quantitative understanding of physics concepts\n                           in courses taught by traditional and non-traditional methods and students' understanding\n                           of topics in modern physics and quantum mechanics. Recently, I was a Principal Investigator\n                           on a Large-Scale Assessment Project at Texas Tech University (TTU), that included\n                           systematic and comprehensive assessment of all of the introductory undergraduate courses\n                           at TTU, utilizing conceptual inventories, free response pre-\/post-testing, and TA\n                           evaluation inventories. We found that when PER-informed materials and instruction\n                           are introduced in the labs and recitations, independent of the lecture style, there\n                           is an increase in students' conceptual inventory and free-response gains. There is\n                           also an increase in those gains if PER-informed instruction is used in the lecture.\n                           The highest gain increase is achieved (in both conceptual inventories and free-response\n                           pre-\/post-tests) by the combination of PER-informed lectures and laboratories in large\n                           class settings and by PER-informed hands-on, laboratory-based, inquiry-based courses\n                           (part of a curriculum designed for health science majors) taught in a small class\n                           setting. I am presently working on expanding the inquiry-based course to a larger\n                           classroom, including LA training and assessment and analysis and assessment of students'\n                           thinking skills. I am also restarting my research in modern physics and quantum mechanics.
