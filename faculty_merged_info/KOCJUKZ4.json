Areas of Expertise: Karl Sandeman is interested in how we may tailor phase transitions in so-called functional materials for either the efficient use of energy, such as in refrigeration, or its efficient conversion, such as in power generation.\u00a0 Most of his studies to date have involved magnetic phase transitions, requiring an understanding of the relationship between structure and function at all length-scales and a holistic research approach that combines the use of experimental and theoretical tools.\u00a0 For more information, click the \"website\" link above or go to the websites of the FP7 projects that Karl has coordinated in magnetic cooling: DRREAM (2013-2015) or SSEEC (2008-2011)   Selected Publications: S.P.
