                "Ezra (Ted) Newman Professor Emeritus 406 Allen Hall (412) 624-9048 newman@pitt.edu I taught the graduate course in classical mechanics and general relativity. My research is centered on general relativity \u2013 the Einstein equations for gravity. More precisely I am interested in properties and the behavior of light\u2013rays in the presence of gravitational fields and how the gravitational field can be reconstructed from the properties of the the light\u2013rays.
