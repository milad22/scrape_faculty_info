                "Ralph Z Roskies Professor 312A Schenley Place. 4420 Bayard Street 412-648-3094 roskies@pitt.edu Roskies is the author of over 60 papers in theoretical elementary particle physics, including aspects of lattice gauge theory and symbolic computation methods applied to fundamental problems in quantum electrodynamics. In 1984, together with Professor Michael Levine of Carnegie Mellon University and James Kasdorf from Westinghouse, he developed the proposal to the National Science Foundation for what became the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).\u00a0 As Scientific Director, Roskies oversaw operations, planned its future course, and concerned himself with its scientific impact. Roskies was also co-PI of the NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project, the NSF\u2019s largest cyber infrastructure project. He has served as advisor to and as reviewer of a large number of U.S. and international supercomputing centers. PSC is a joint effort of Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. It has been a national leader in providing the highest capability computing to the US national research community. It has pioneered developments in file systems, heterogeneous computing, parallel algorithms and data intensive computing. Its most recent supercomputer, called Bridges, offers leading edge computation including low latency, high bandwidth nodes, large shared memory nodes, GPUs, virtual machines, persistent databases, and powerful I\/O. It is designed to make it easy for users who have not traditionally used high performance computing to scale up from desktop systems, small clusters or laptops. Roskies retired from PSC in 2017. He is currently Vice Chancellor for Research Computing at the University of Pittsburgh and heads the Center for Research Computing (CRC) at Pitt. The CRC provides leading-edge computational resources to Pitt researchers, provides training in their use, and offers personalized consulting to Pitt researchers. See www.crc.pitt.edu .
