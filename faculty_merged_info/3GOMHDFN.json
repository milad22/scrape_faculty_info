                "We present measurements of the ratio of the proton elastic electromagnetic form factors, \u03bc p G Ep\/G Mp. The Jefferson Lab Hall A Focal Plane Polarimeter was used to determine the longitudinal and transverse components of the recoil proton polarization in ep elastic scattering; the ratio of these polarization components is proportional to the ratio of the two form factors. These data reproduce the observation of Jones et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1398 (2000)], that the form factor ratio decreases significantly from unity above Q 2= 1 GeV 2.",
                "We estimate the two-photon exchange contribution to elastic electron-proton scattering at large momentum transfer through the scattering off a parton in the proton. We relate the two-photon exchange amplitude to the generalized parton distributions which appear in hard exclusive processes. We find that when taking the polarization transfer determinations of the form factors as input, adding in the 2-photon correction does reproduce the Rosenbluth cross sections.",

                "We estimate the two-photon exchange contribution to elastic electron-proton scattering at large momentum transfer by using a quark-parton representation of virtual Compton scattering. We thus can relate the two-photon exchange amplitude to the generalized parton distributions which also enter in other wide-angle scattering processes. We find that the interference of one-and two-photon exchange contribution is able to substantially resolve the difference between electric form factor measurements from Rosenbluth and polarization transfer experiments. Two-photon exchange has additional consequences which could be experimentally observed, including nonzero polarization effects and a positron-proton\/electron-proton scattering asymmetry. The predicted Rosenbluth plot is no longer precisely linear; it acquires a measurable curvature, particularly at large laboratory angle.",

                "We report the first evidence for a nonzero beam-spin azimuthal asymmetry in the electroproduction of positive pions in the deep-inelastic kinematic region. Data for the reaction e p\u2192 e\u2032 \u03c0+ X have been obtained using a polarized electron beam of 4.3 GeV with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The amplitude of the sin \u03c6 modulation increases with the momentum of the pion relative to the virtual photon, z. In the range z= 0.5\u20130.8 the average amplitude is 0.038\u00b10.005\u00b10.003 for a missing mass M X> 1.1 GeV and 0.037\u00b10.007\u00b10.004 for M X> 1.4 GeV.",

                "We report on the first results of a sensitive search for scalar coupling of photons to a light neutral boson in the mass range of approximately 1.0 meV (milli-electron volts) and coupling strength greater than 10\u2212 6 GeV\u2212 1 using optical photons. This was a photon regeneration experiment using the \u201clight shining through a wall\u201d technique in which laser light was passed through a strong magnetic field upstream of an optical beam dump; regenerated laser light was then searched for downstream of a second magnetic field region optically shielded from the former. Our results show no evidence for scalar coupling in this region of parameter space.",
                "The neutron elastic magnetic form factor was extracted from quasielastic electron scattering on deuterium over the range Q 2= 1.0\u20134.8 GeV 2 with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab. High precision was achieved with a ratio technique and a simultaneous in situ calibration of the neutron detection efficiency. Neutrons were detected with electromagnetic calorimeters and time-of-flight scintillators at two beam energies. The dipole parametrization gives a good description of the data."
