                "Analysis of current spikes associated with pitting events was performed on high purity Al loop wire electrodes over a range of Cl\u2212 concentrations (10\u2212 4 to 1M) and potentiostatically applied potentials. A distribution of pitting and repassivation potentials was observed at each Cl\u2212 concentration. Factors controlling the transition from metastable to stable pitting were identified by comparing the electrochemical behaviors of stable pits at elapsed times equal to the mean lifetime of metastable pits. This comparison also provided insight on the origins of statistical distributions of pitting potentials. The key differences were that (i) stable pits had a faster rate of rise in pit current which implies a faster growth rate and, subsequently, larger pit radii at times equal to metastable pit lifetimes, and (ii) stable pits satisfied the criterion, at all times during growth, indicating that a concentrated solution must be maintained for pit survival \u2026",
                "The polarization resistance method for the determination of instantaneous corrosion rates of metals were reviewed. The assumptions in electrode kinetics that govern the connection between the slope of steady-state applied electrochemical potential-applied current density (Eapp-iapp) measurements (i.e., the polarization resistance) and the corrosion rate were restated. Electrochemical impedance, as well as statistical and spectral electrochemical noise methods for obtaining polarization resistance, also were discussed. Traditional sources of error such as high excitation voltage amplitudes, insufficiently slow voltage ramp rates, high alternating current (AC) frequencies, inadequate polarization hold periods, high solution resistance, presence of parallel reduction-oxidation reactions, and nonuniform current and potential distributions were examined with the goal of defining some of the conditions and \u2026",
                "Electrochemical impedance results are presented for 550 day exposures of organic\u2010coated carbon steel samples. Coatings consisted of translucent pigmented and unpigmented epoxy and conventional opaque epoxy polyamide systems. Coating thicknesses ranged from 20 to 185 \u03bcm. Specimens were exposed under freely corroding conditions and at two cathodic polarization levels (\u2212 850 and\u2212 1250 mV vs. SCE) in ASTM artificial ocean water. The objective was to identify impedance parameters which measure subcritical coated\u2010metal system property changes at early exposure times that predict significant long\u2010term coating deterioration. Impedance data developed at early times, including coating resistance, coating capacitance, the increase in frequency for the coating's 45 phase angle, and low frequency impedance data, are compared to the coating system's performance after 550 days exposure.

                "Experiments were conducted to enable the simultaneous measurement of electrochemical impedance and collection of hydrogen gas during the corrosion of pure magnesium in NaCl solutions. These results were then assessed along with the attendant specimen mass loss, providing three unique measures of magnesium corrosion for the same specimen. It was determined that analysis of impedance data, while accounting for a physically justified inductive response at low frequencies, enabled the determination of the polarization resistance, RP at the zero frequency limit. The determination of RP, as evaluated herein from electrochemical testing, provided excellent correlation to the mass loss and volume of hydrogen collected. This finding is elaborated in a broader discussion that critically addresses previous studies which have utilized the impedance behavior of magnesium and which claim electrochemical tests \u2026",
                "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) applies well to surfaces having a high electrical or electrochemical impedance. The method is, therefore, particularly suitable for the early detection of the degradation of highly resistive protective organic coatings on metals. Initial application of electrical methods for evaluating organic coatings on steel involved measurement of DC resistance or determination of an equivalent capacitance measured at a single frequency. Changes in the capacitance relate to the uptake of water while changes in the resistance of the coating have been analyzed in terms of penetration by ionic species from the environment. In recent years the measurement of the frequency-dependent impedance of a coating has allowed a more detailed evaluation based on the deviation of the coating impedance from a capacitive response. Several models specify readily determined parameters \u2026",
                "Stainless steels undergo a sharp rise in pitting corrosion rate as the potential, solution concentration, or temperature is changed only slightly. We report experiments using real-time microscopic in situ visualizations that resolve the nucleation and evolution of individual pits during the transition. They suggest that the sudden onset of corrosion is explained by an explosive autocatalytic growth in the number of metastable pits and that stabilization of individual pits takes place only later. This finding agrees with a theoretical approach treating the onset of pitting corrosion as a cooperative critical phenomenon resulting from interactions among metastable pits, and it extends perspectives on the control and prevention of corrosion onset."
