                "Dissipation can serve as a powerful resource for controlling the behavior of open quantum systems. Recently there has been a surge of interest in the influence of dissipative coupling on large quantum systems and, more specifically, how these processes can influence band topology and phenomena like many-body localization. Here, we explore the engineering of local, tunable dissipation in so-called synthetic lattices, arrays of quantum states that are parametrically coupled in a fashion analogous to quantum tunneling. Considering the specific case of momentum-state lattices, we investigate two distinct mechanisms for engineering controlled loss: one relying on an explicit form of dissipation by spontaneous emission, and another relying on reversible coupling to a large reservoir of unoccupied states. We experimentally implement the latter and demonstrate the ability to tune the local loss coefficient over a large \u2026"
