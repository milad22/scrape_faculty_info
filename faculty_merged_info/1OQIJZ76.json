                "Many researchers, especially those new to the field, need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy, either for the purposes of their own research, or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review. 1 Acceptable standards are an important issue, particularly considering that each of us may have his\/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately, the answer is in part a \u201cmoving target\u201d as the field evolves. 2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria, only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas. Conversely, as a reviewer, it is tiresome to raise the same objections repeatedly, wondering why researchers have not fulfilled some of the basic requirements for establishing the occurrence of an autophagic process. In addition, drugs that potentially modulate autophagy are increasingly being used in clinical trials, and \u2026",
                "Copy number variation (CNV) of DNA sequences is functionally significant but has yet to be fully ascertained. We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number variable regions (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12% of the genome) were identified in these populations. These CNVRs contained hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements and segmental duplications. Notably, the CNVRs encompassed more nucleotide content per genome than SNPs, underscoring the \u2026",
                "Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the transcription, translation and turnover of messenger RNAs and proteins. Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under \u2026",
                "Research in autophagy continues to accelerate, 1 and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. 2, 3 There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from fully functional autophagy that \u2026",
                "Genetic studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis of complex human phenotypes require the genotyping of many thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across large numbers of individuals 1. Public efforts have so far identified over two million common human SNPs 2; however, the scoring of these SNPs is labor-intensive and requires a substantial amount of automation. Here we describe a simple but effective approach, termed whole-genome sampling analysis (WGSA), for genotyping thousands of SNPs simultaneously in a complex DNA sample without locus-specific primers or automation. Our method amplifies highly reproducible fractions of the genome across multiple DNA samples and calls genotypes at> 99% accuracy. We rapidly genotyped 14,548 SNPs in three different human populations and identified a subset of them with significant allele frequency differences between \u2026",
                "Sunitinib resistance is a major challenge for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective strategies against sunitinib resistance are highly desired in the clinic. Here we identified an lncRNA, named lncARSR (lncRNA Activated in RCC with Sunitinib Resistance), which correlated with clinically poor sunitinib response. lncARSR promoted sunitinib resistance via competitively binding miR-34\/miR-449 to facilitate AXL and c-MET expression in RCC cells. Furthermore, bioactive lncARSR could be incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to sensitive cells, thus disseminating sunitinib resistance. Treatment of sunitinib-resistant RCC with locked nucleic acids targeting lncARSR or an AXL\/c-MET inhibitor restored sunitinib response. Therefore, lncARSR may serve as a predictor and a potential therapeutic target for sunitinib resistance."
