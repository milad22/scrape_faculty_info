                "Optical sensor technology offers significant opportunities in the field of medical research and clinical diagnostics, particularly for the detection of small numbers of molecules in highly diluted solutions. Several methods have been developed for this purpose, including label-free plasmonic biosensors based on metamaterials. However, the detection of lower-molecular-weight (< 500 Da) biomolecules in highly diluted solutions is still a challenging issue owing to their lower polarizability. In this context, we have developed a miniaturized plasmonic biosensor platform based on a hyperbolic metamaterial that can support highly confined bulk plasmon guided modes over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. By exciting these modes using a grating-coupling technique, we achieved different extreme sensitivity modes with a maximum of 30,000 nm per refractive index unit (RIU) and a record figure of merit \u2026",
                "The first observation of random laser action in a partially ordered, optically anisotropic nematic liquid crystal with long-range dielectric tensor fluctuations is reported. Above a given pump power the fluorescence curve collapses and the typical narrowing and explosion effect leads to discrete sharp peaks. The unexpected surviving of interference effects in recurrent multiple scattering provide the required optical feedback for lasing in nematics. Coherent backscattering of light waves in orientationally ordered nematic liquid crystals manifests a weak localization of light which strongly supports diffusive laser action in presence of gain medium. Intensity fluctuations of the speckle\u2013like emission pattern indicate the typical spatio-temporal randomness of diffusive laser emission. A comparison of the laser action is reported for systems with different order degree: fully disordered semiconductor powders, self-ordered \u2026",
                "Here, we numerically investigate the existence of negative group refraction in graphene-based hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) at THz frequencies. The hyperbolic dispersion of the graphene-based HMM can be tuned by varying the chemical potential and surrounding dielectric layer thickness. The negative group and positive phase indices of refraction are observed for oblique incidence at far below the critical frequency, which permits negative energy refraction and forward wavefront propagation. The highly confined bulk plasmon modes are also observed in the negative group index region that further evidence the negative refraction behaviour of the graphene-based hyperbolic metamaterials.",
                "Distributed feedback microstructures play a fundamental role in confining and manipulating light to obtain lasing in media with gain. Here, we present an innovative array of organic, color-tunable microlasers which are intrinsically phase locked. Dye-doped helixed liquid crystals were embedded within periodic, polymeric microchannels sculptured by light through a single-step process. The helical superstructure was oriented along the microchannels; the lasing was observed along the same direction at the red edge of the stop band. Several physical and technological advantages arise from this engineered heterostructure: a high quality factor of the cavity, ultralow lasing threshold, and thermal and electric control of the lasing wavelength and emission intensity. This level of integration of guest-host systems, embedded in artificially patterned small sized structures, might lead to new photonic chip architectures.",
                "Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) represent a novel class of fascinating anisotropic plasmonic materials, supporting highly confined bulk plasmon polaritons in addition to the surface plasmon polaritons. However, it is very challenging to tailor and excite those modes at optical frequencies using prism coupling technique because of the intrinsic difficulties to engineer non-traditional optical properties using artificial nanostructures and the unavailability of high refractive index prisms for matching the momentum between the incident light and the guided modes. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the excitation of both surface and bulk plasmon polaritons in a HMM through a grating coupling technique of surface plasmon excitation that makes use a hypergrating, which is a combined structure of metallic diffraction grating and HMM. Initially, we propose an optical hyperbolic metamaterial based on Au\/TiO 2 multilayers \u2026"

The inclination toward miniaturization in the emerging generation of nanoscale materials has led to a growing interest in the physics of hybrid nanostructures to understand and exploit interactions arising by confinement, topology and dimensionality. In recent years significant strides have been made in the understanding of phenomena due to the manipulation and organization of atoms and molecules by mimicking processes and strategies adopted by Mother Nature. My earlier research has mainly involved the experimental study of dynamics, electro-optical properties and lasing in soft matter by means of laser spectroscopies. Random lasing and DFB lasers have been extensively investigated in my group for many years.  Another relevant topic we have been interested concerns electro-hydrodynamic instabilities and turbulence in liquid crystals; It has represented an interesting scientific arena to explore the amazing physics behind the chaotic dynamics and random lasing. More recently, my research interests are focused on the physics of waves and fields in nanostructured plasmonic metamaterials, artificial composite materials whose electromagnetic properties are induced by organizing atoms and molecules at deeply sub-wavelength scales. Nanophotonics is the new branch of physics that is involved to study new effects and phenomena arising from interplay and dynamics between molecules and few tens of atoms thick nanostructures. Currently, we are exploring several fascinating topics, such as: Extreme optics to design biosensing platforms based on hyperbolic metamaterials to detect ultralow molecular weight analytes and biomarkers; Indefinite dispersion metamaterials that support virtually infinite photonic density of states (speed-up of QE spontaneous emission; perfect absorption, subwavelength imaging, etc.,) Plasmon-exciton interplay and ultrafast dinamics in hybrid nanoassemblies (Purcell effect, Loss mitigation, hot electrons) Emission, transport and coherence features in amplifying random laser systems (photon statistics, spatial and temporal coherence, spatial distribution of the emission intensity, confinement geometries); Electromagnetic properties of intrinsically active and tunable photonic metamaterials. These topics allow us to realize a cutting edge research program in the areas of soft-condensed matter, Nanoscience, Biosensing, Spectroscopy, Nonlinear Optics and Nanophotonics. Publications K. V.
