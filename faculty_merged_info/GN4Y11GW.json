                "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have the potential to \u201ctransform science education and give all students\u2026 the skills and knowledge they need to be informed citizens, college ready, and prepared for STEM careers\u201d(NSTA 2013). But as we open our arms to the NGSS, we also need to ask ourselves: How do we know if we are making the goals of the NGSS a reality for our students? How are we going to assess whether students know and can do what is described in the NGSS? Assessment occurs at many levels, including national (eg, National Assessment of Educational Progress), state, district, school, and classroom. At each of these levels, standardized assessments are important and affect decisions, policies, and practices in education. Change in standardized assessment is important for measuring and sustaining change in education (NRC 2012). The new standards provide both challenges \u2026",

Anthropology, FSU) came to UCF as the new Teacher-in-Residence in the fall of 2015 after teaching high school Physics and Physical Science in Tallahassee, FL since 2003. He has been a physics content expert on the Florida Department of Education\u2019s teacher certification exams, 6-12 science course curriculum, and Common Core integration and for Newton\u2019s Playground, research into game-based physics learning and assessment funded by the Gates Foundation and US DoD. Adam\u2019s research includes formative assessment strategies and performance assessment alternatives to large-scale, high-stakes science tests at the Center for Advancement of Learning and Assessment, FSU, and the CMS detector collaboration at CERN\u2019s LHC that discovered the Higgs boson. In K-12 schools, Adam mentors future and beginning teachers, coordinates Lesson Study and Teachers With Open Doors peer observation with high school faculty, and is a Quarknet Teaching and Learning Fellow.
