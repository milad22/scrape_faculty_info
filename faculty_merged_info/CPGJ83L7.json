                "Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, which have proved to be promising semiconductor materials for photovoltaic applications, have been made into atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) sheets. We report the solution-phase growth of single- and few-unit-cell-thick single-crystalline 2D hybrid perovskites of (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 with well-defined square shape and large size. In contrast to other 2D materials, the hybrid perovskite sheets exhibit an unusual structural relaxation, and this structural change leads to a band gap shift as compared to the bulk crystal. The high-quality 2D crystals exhibit efficient photoluminescence, and color tuning could be achieved by changing sheet thickness as well as composition via the synthesis of related materials.",
                "The near-unity efficiency of energy transfer in photosynthesis makes photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes a promising avenue for developing new renewable energy technologies. Knowledge of the energy landscape of these complexes is essential in understanding their function, but its experimental determination has proven elusive. Here, the observation of quantum coherence using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy is employed to directly measure the 14 lowest electronic energy levels in light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), the most abundant antenna complex in plants containing approximately 50% of the world\u2019s chlorophyll. We observe that the electronically excited states are relatively evenly distributed, highlighting an important design principle of photosynthetic complexes that explains the observed ultrafast intracomplex energy transfer in LHCII.",
                "The distinct physical properties of hybrid organic\u2013inorganic materials can lead to unexpected nonequilibrium phenomena that are difficult to characterize due to the broad range of length and time scales involved. For instance, mixed halide hybrid perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronics, yet bulk measurements suggest the halides reversibly phase separate upon photoexcitation. By combining nanoscale imaging and multiscale modeling, we find that the nature of halide demixing in these materials is distinct from macroscopic phase separation. We propose that the localized strain induced by a single photoexcited charge interacting with the soft, ionic lattice is sufficient to promote halide phase separation and nucleate a light-stabilized, low-bandgap, \u223c8 nm iodide-rich cluster. The limited extent of this polaron is essential to promote demixing because by contrast bulk strain would simply be relaxed \u2026",
                "Photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes absorb energy and guide photoexcitations to reaction centers with speed and efficacy that produce near-perfect efficiency. Light harvesting complex II (LHCII) is the most abundant light-harvesting complex and is responsible for absorbing the majority of light energy in plants. We apply two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to examine energy flow in LHCII. This technique allows for direct mapping of excitation energy pathways as a function of absorption and emission wavelength. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that excitation energy transfers through the complex on three time scales: previously unobserved sub-100 fs relaxation through spatially overlapping states, several hundred femtosecond transfer between nearby chlorophylls, and picosecond energy transfer steps between layers of pigments. All energy is observed to collect into the energetically \u2026",
                "  The properties of molecular aggregates, coupled clusters of small molecules, are often challenging to unravel because of their inherent complexity and disordered environments. Their structure\u2212function relationships are often far from obvious. However, their ability to efficiently channel excitation energy over remarkable distances, as is the case in photosynthetic light harvesting, is a compelling motivation to investigate them. Understanding and subsequently mimicking the processes in photosynthesis, for example, will set the stage for considerable advances in using light harvesting to fuel renewable energy technologies.Two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy is emerging as a nonlinear optical technique that provides significant insight into the interactions and dynamics of complex molecular systems. In addition to spectrally resolving excitation and emission energies over significant bandwidths with \u2026",
                "Photosynthetic organisms harvest sunlight with near unity quantum efficiency. The complexity of the electronic structure and energy transfer pathways within networks of photosynthetic pigment\u2013protein complexes often obscures the mechanisms behind the efficient light-absorption-to-charge conversion process. Recent experiments, particularly using two-dimensional spectroscopy, have detected long-lived quantum coherence, which theory suggests may contribute to the effectiveness of photosynthetic energy transfer. Here, we present a new, direct method to access coherence signals: a coherence-specific polarization sequence, which isolates the excitonic coherence features from the population signals that usually dominate two-dimensional spectra. With this polarization sequence, we elucidate coherent dynamics and determine the overall measurable lifetime of excitonic coherence in the major light-harvesting \u2026",
                "In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in manipulating matter with light, and light with matter 1. Resonant laser fields interacting with cold, dense atom clouds provide a particularly rich system 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Such light fields interact strongly with the internal electrons of the atoms, and couple directly to external atomic motion through recoil momenta imparted when photons are absorbed and emitted. Ultraslow light propagation in Bose\u2013Einstein condensates 7 represents an extreme example of resonant light manipulation using cold atoms. Here we demonstrate that a slow light pulse can be stopped and stored in one Bose\u2013Einstein condensate and subsequently revived from a totally different condensate, 160 \u03bcm away; information is transferred through conversion of the optical pulse into a travelling matter wave. In the presence of an optical coupling field, a probe laser pulse is first injected into one of \u2026",
                "We present the experimental discovery of compound structures comprising solitons and vortex rings in Bose-Einstein condensates. We examine both their creation via soliton-vortex collisions and their subsequent development, which is largely governed by the dynamics of interacting vortex rings. A theoretical model in three-dimensional cylindrical symmetry is also presented.",
                "We reveal substantial luminescence yield heterogeneity among individual subdiffraction grains of high-performing methylammonium lead halide perovskite films by using high-resolution cathodoluminescence microscopy. Using considerably lower accelerating voltages than is conventional in scanning electron microscopy, we image the electron beam-induced luminescence of the films and statistically characterize the depth-dependent role of defects that promote nonradiative recombination losses. The highest variability in the luminescence intensity is observed at the exposed grain surfaces, which we attribute to surface defects. By probing deeper into the film, it appears that bulk defects are more homogeneously distributed. By identifying the origin and variability of a surface-specific loss mechanism that deleteriously impacts device efficiency, we suggest that producing films homogeneously composed of the \u2026",
                "Experiments are described that elucidate the quantum mechanical origins of the free induction decay voltage and of spin noise. It is shown that the experimentally measured FID voltage induced in a Hertzian loop receiving coil following a 90\u00b0 pulse is typically two orders of magnitude too large to be accounted for by the current quantum theory of signal reception\u2014coherent spontaneous emission. An experiment is then presented in which spin noise is easily observed in a circuit with a Q-factor of order unity, thereby undermining a popular hypothesis that such noise is due to spontaneous emission and is only observable because of the enhancement in the density of the radiation field in a high Q-factor tuned circuit, the NMR probe. Both the free induction decay and the spin noise are shown to be accurately predicted by near-field Faraday induction, which is described in the theory of quantum electrodynamics by an \u2026"
