I am also a member of the Cottrell Scholar Collaborative . My experimental optics research group develops ultrahigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy techniques to study nanoscale systems such as quantum dots, nanowires, thin films, and biological cells. My science education efforts span multiple scales and include individual course reform, development of instructional support programs, building an interdisciplinary science education research cluster, and national-scale education collaborations. \u00a9 Jordan Gerton 2019 [Back To Top]"
