                "From spin resonance of two-dimensional (2D) conduction electrons in a modulation doped SiGe\/Si\/SiGe quantum well structure we find a 2D anisotropy of both the line broadening (dephasing time) and the g factor. Both can be explained consistently employing the Bychkov-Rashba (BR) term H BR= \u03b1 (k\u00d7 \u03c3)\u22c5 e z, which turns out here to be the dominant coupling between electron orbital motion and spin. We obtain a BR parameter of \u03b1= 0.55\u00d7 10\u2212 12 eV cm\u2014three orders of magnitude smaller than in quantum well structures based on III-V semiconductors, consistent with the much smaller spin-orbit coupling in Si.",
                "Exploration of spin currents in organic semiconductors (OSECs) induced by resonant microwave absorption in ferromagnetic substrates is appealing for potential spintronics applications. Owing to the inherently weak spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) of OSECs, their inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) response is very subtle; limited by the microwave power applicable under continuous-wave (cw) excitation. Here we introduce a novel approach for generating significant ISHE signals in OSECs using pulsed ferromagnetic resonance, where the ISHE is two to three orders of magnitude larger compared to cw excitation. This strong ISHE enables us to investigate a variety of OSECs ranging from \u03c0-conjugated polymers with strong SOC that contain intrachain platinum atoms, to weak SOC polymers, to C 60 films, where the SOC is predominantly caused by the curvature of the molecule\u2019s surface. The pulsed-ISHE technique offers a \u2026"
