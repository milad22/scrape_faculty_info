Nanofluidics. Biosensors and Functional Biomaterials. Membrane protein design. The right-hand panel illustrates a 3 nm pore in silicon nitride. Image was taken in STEM mode on the FEI Tecnai F20 TEM\/STEM at the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR). The left-hand panel shows a single-channel electrical recording of transient current blockades produced by individual double-stranded DNA molecules.
