Our group includes\n                  faculty whose expertise is in the area of physics education, as well as research faculty\n                  who voluntarily make contributions to this important area. We often collaborate with\n                  science education faculty from the LSU College of Education, and with faculty from\n                  other colleges and universities throughout the state and nation. In fact, most of\n                  our programs are either statewide or national in scope. Our activities include cognitive\n                  research to better understand how students learn physics concepts, design of new courses\n                  and curricula, development of associated curriculum materials and resources, exploring\n                  innovative educational uses for new technologies, and special enhancement programs\n                  for practicing teachers and precollege students."
