                " ERIN A. KARA Assistant Professor of Physics EMAIL: ekara@mit.edu PHONE: (617) 253-2572 Ronald McNair Building, 37-607 Curriculum Vitae (updated 6\/5\/2020) MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research Astronomers observe evolution of a black hole as it wolfs down stellar material , 1.9.2019] Astrophysics Professor Kara is an observational astrophysicist, working to understand the physics behind how black holes grow and affect\u00a0their environments. She has advanced a new technique called X-ray reverberation mapping, which allows astronomers to map\u00a0the gas falling on to black holes and measure the effects of strongly curved spacetime close to the event horizon. She also\u00a0works on variety of transient phenomena, such as tidal disruption events and Galactic black hole outbursts.\u00a0She is a NASA\u00a0Participating Scientist for XRISM Observatory, a joint JAXA \/ NASA X-ray spectroscopy mission, and co-chairs the\u00a0supermassive black hole working group. Erin Kara is originally from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and attended Barnard College, where she obtained a B.A. in physics with\u00a0a minor in art history. After graduating in 2011, she moved to the United Kingdom on a Gates Cambridge Scholarship to study\u00a0for a Masters and a PhD from the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge. In 2015, she was awarded a NASA\u00a0Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow, which she took to the University of Maryland and NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. In 2018,\u00a0she became the Neil Gehrels Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Maryland, and joined the faculty of MIT as an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Physics in July 2019.
