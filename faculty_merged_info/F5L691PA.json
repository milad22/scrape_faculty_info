                "The apparent excess of gamma rays in an extended region in the direction of the Galactic Center has a spatial distribution and amplitude that are suggestive of dark matter annihilations. If this excess is indeed due to dark matter annihilations, it would indicate the presence of both dark matter and an additional particle beyond the Standard Model that mediates the interactions between the dark matter and Standard Model states. We introduce reference models describing dark matter annihilation to pairs of these new mediators, which decouples the SM-mediator coupling from the thermal annihilation cross section and easily explains the lack of direct detection signals. We determine the parameter regions that give good descriptions of the gamma-ray excess for several motivated choices of mediator couplings to the SM. We find fermion dark matter with mass 7\u201326 GeV and a dark vector mediator, or scalar dark matter \u2026"

He has worked on a range of topics in theoretical particle physics, including Supersymmetry, LHC searches for New Physics, and Grand Unified Theories. In theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, he is interested in exploring novel dark matter models with distinct implications for experiments and observations.
