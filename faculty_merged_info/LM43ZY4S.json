For the past twenty years, we have enhanced science learning experiences for children by providing science outreach programs so rich in substance and captivating in presentation that requests are endless. This is in response to our philosophy that ensuring a superior level of science and technical education (accurate and engaging) must be the shared responsibility of teachers and practitioners as they serve as complementary agents of the learning experience. We constructed this website in order to amplify and extend these learning benefits, and we provided our program with a fitting name: Lehigh University Science Learning Adventures, abbreviated as LehighSLA. As with many websites, this one is in a state of rapid development. And, although many more of its intended functionalities will become operational in the near future, some of the most important ones are available right now... Students & Parents: Parents\u0085How would you like to share the adventure of your child\u0092s recent science outreach program? Simply click  on Your Outreach Program , and then select your school and program. For programs run with our wonderful partners at the DaVinci Science Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania, click on DaVinci Center . Teachers: Although still limited, we have been capturing teacher learning experiences provided by LehighSLA. Click on Science Education , and then on either Teacher Learning Programs or DaVinci Center Teacher Programs . If we ran a program in your class, you may find Your Outreach Program useful as well. We hope you find our website rewarding, and that you share this site with your friends and colleagues. As always, it is a pleasure to work with your wonderful sons and daughters, and my exceptional teacher colleagues here in the Lehigh Valley! If you have comments or suggestions, please send me an e-mail at lgd0@lehigh.edu (lima-golf-delta-zero). Funding for these Programs is provided by grants from...
