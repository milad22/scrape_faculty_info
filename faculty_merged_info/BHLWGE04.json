                "This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg 2 of imaging data, with most of the~ 2000 deg 2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120 long, 2 fdg 5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg 2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg 2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was \u2026",
                "This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through 2005 June and represents the completion of the SDSS\u2010I project (whose successor, SDSS\u2010II, will continue through mid\u20102008). It includes five\u2010band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg2 and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 deg2 of that imaging data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. In addition to \u201cstandard\u201d SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy \u2026",
                "The Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) Survey obtained\u2248 240,000 moderate-resolution (R~ 1800) spectra from 3900 \u00c5 to 9000 \u00c5 of fainter Milky Way stars (14.0< g< 20.3) of a wide variety of spectral types, both main-sequence and evolved objects, with the goal of studying the kinematics and populations of our Galaxy and its halo. The spectra are clustered in 212 regions spaced over three quarters of the sky. Radial velocity accuracies for stars are  at g< 18, degrading to  at g~ 20. For stars with signal-to-noise ratio> 10 per resolution element, stellar atmospheric parameters are estimated, including metallicity, surface gravity, and effective temperature. SEGUE obtained 3500 deg 2 of additional ugriz imaging (primarily at low Galactic latitudes) providing precise multicolor photometry (\u03c3 (g, r, i)~ 2%),(\u03c3 (u, z)~ 3%) and astrometry (\u2248 0 farcs 1) for \u2026",
                "The LSPM catalog is a comprehensive list of 61,977 stars north of the J2000 celestial equator that have proper motions larger than 0 farcs 15 yr-1 (local-background-stars frame). The catalog has been generated primarily as a result of our systematic search for high proper motion stars in the Digitized Sky Surveys using our SUPERBLINK software. At brighter magnitudes, the catalog incorporates stars and data from the Tycho-2 Catalogue and also, to a lesser extent, from the All-Sky Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 million stars. The LSPM catalog considerably expands over the old Luyten (Luyten Half-Second [LHS] and New Luyten Two-Tenths [NLTT]) catalogs, superseding them for northern declinations. Positions are given with an accuracy of lesssim 100 mas at the 2000.0 epoch, and absolute proper motions are given with an accuracy of\u2248 8 mas yr-1. Corrections to the local-background-stars proper motions have \u2026",
                "We describe the current plans for a spectroscopic survey of millions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy using the Guo Shou Jing Telescope (GSJT, formerly called the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope\u2014LAMOST). The survey will obtain spectra for 2.5 million stars brighter than r< 19 during dark\/grey time, and 5 million stars brighter than r< 17 or J< 16 on nights that are moonlit or have low transparency. The survey will begin in the fall of 2012, and will run for at least four years. The telescope's design constrains the optimal declination range for observations to 10< \u03b4< 50, and site conditions lead to an emphasis on stars in the direction of the Galactic anticenter. The survey is divided into three parts with different target selection strategies: disk, anticenter, and spheroid. The resulting dataset will be used to study the merger history of the Milky Way, the substructure and evolution of the disks, the \u2026",
                "We report the discovery of a several\u2010Jupiter\u2013mass planetary companion to the primary lens star in microlensing event OGLE\u20102005\u2010BLG\u2010071. Precise (\u22721%) photometry at the peak of the event yields an extremely high signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio detection of a deviation from the light curve expected from an isolated lens. The planetary character of this deviation is easily and unambiguously discernible from the gross features of the light curve. Detailed modeling yields a tightly constrained planet\u2010star mass ratio of q\u2009=\u2009mp\/M\u2009=\u20090.0071\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0003. This is the second robust detection of a planet with microlensing, demonstrating that the technique itself is viable and that planets are not rare in the systems probed by microlensing, which typically lie several kiloparsecs toward the Galactic center.",
                "We present an all-sky catalog of M dwarf stars with apparent infrared magnitude J< 10. The 8889 stars are selected from the ongoing SUPERBLINK survey of stars with proper motion \u03bc> 40 mas yr\u20131, supplemented on the bright end with the Tycho-2 catalog. Completeness tests which account for kinematic (proper motion) bias suggest that our catalog represents\u2248 75% of the estimated~ 11, 900 M dwarfs with J< 10 expected to populate the entire sky. Our catalog is, however, significantly more complete for the northern sky (\u2248 90%) than it is for the south (\u2248 60%). Stars are identified as cool, red M dwarfs from a combination of optical and infrared color cuts, and are distinguished from background M giants and highly reddened stars using either existing parallax measurements or, if such measurements are lacking, using their location in an optical-to-infrared reduced proper motion diagram. These bright M dwarfs are \u2026",
                "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be conducting a nearly all-sky photometric survey over two years, with a core mission goal to discover small transiting exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars. It will obtain 30 minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with two-minute cadence observations of 200,000\u2013400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the two-minute cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL \u2026",
                "We present time series of ultra-high S\/N, high-resolution spectra of the He II 4686 \u00c5 emission line in the O4I (n) f supergiant \u03b6 Puppis, the brightest early-type O star in the sky. These reveal stochastic variable substructures in the line, which tend to move away from the line center with time. Similar scaled-up features are well established in the strong winds of Wolf-Rayet stars (the presumed descendants of O stars), where they are explained by outward-moving inhomogeneities (eg, blobs, clumps, and shocks) in the winds. If all hot star winds are clumped like that of \u03b6 Pup, as is plausible, then mass loss rates based on recombination-line intensities will have to be revised downward. Using a standard\" \u03b2\" velocity law, we deduce a value of \u03b2= 1.0-1.2 to account for the kinematics of these structures in the wind of \u03b6 Pup. In addition to the small-scale stochastic variations, we also find a slow systematic variation of the mean \u2026",
                "We present high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring of the line-profile variations (LPVs) in the He II \u03bb5411 emission line of four Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars of the WN sequence (HD 96548, HD 191765, HD 192163, and HD 193077) and in the C III \u03bb5696 emission line of five WR stars of the WC sequence (HD 164270, HD 165763, HD 192103, HD 192641, and HD 193793). The LPVs are shown to present systematic patterns: they all consist of a number of relatively narrow emission subpeaks that tend to move from the line centers toward the line edges. We introduce a phenomenological model that depicts WR winds as being made up of a large number of randomly distributed, radially propagating, discrete wind emission elements (DWEEs). This working model is used to simulate LPV patterns in emission lines from a clumped wind. General properties of the LPV patterns are analyzed with the help of novel numerical \u2026"
