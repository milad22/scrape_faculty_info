                "Objectives: The objective of this study was to find HPV DNA incidence in women with CIN and normal women and in their respective partners, as well as the relation between the virus groups found in women with CIN or normal women and in their respective partners. Methods: Partners of 30 women with CIN at several grades and of 60 normal women were prospectively assessed. In men, HPV search was performed by collecting samples through penile scraping for Hybrid Capture, followed by peniscopic evaluation and biopsy of acetowhite lesions. Results: The presence of HPV DNA in male partners does not necessarily implicate the presence of HPV or even CIN in their female partners. Conclusions: If these results are confirmed by other authors, obtaining a peniscopy, a penile biopsy, and a HPV DNA search in partners that present with no clinical lesions, but in couples with women having CIN, would not be \u2026",
                "Os nossos objetivos foram estabelecer a efic\u00e1cia da tomografia computadorizada sem contraste em diagnosticar a ureterolit\u00edase, calcular a freq\u00fc\u00eancia dos principais sinais tomogr\u00e1ficos e medir a concord\u00e2ncia interobservador, comparando-a com os resultados obtidos na urografia excretora, realizando estudo prospectivo duplo-cego em 25 pacientes com c\u00f3lica nefr\u00e9tica. Em ambos os procedimentos avaliamos a exist\u00eancia de aumento renal, hidronefrose e c\u00e1lculo ureteral. Deste \u00faltimo, descrevemos a sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e dimens\u00e3o. Nos exames de tomografia computadorizada sem contraste procuramos tamb\u00e9m por estrias perirrenais, edema periureteral e o sinal do halo. Em 23 dos 25 exames de tomografia computadorizada sem contraste (92%) e em 17 das 25 urografias excretoras (68%) houve concord\u00e2ncia dos resultados entre os dois observadores. Em 21 dos 25 pacientes os resultados dos dois m\u00e9todos foram concordantes. Conclu\u00edmos que a tomografia computadorizada sem contraste apresenta efic\u00e1cia superpon\u00edvel \u00e0 urografia excretora na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de pacientes com c\u00f3lica nefr\u00e9tica, sendo um m\u00e9todo reprodut\u00edvel e sem promover o desconforto do uso do contraste endovenoso.",
                "Brazilian patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were randomised in a 12\u2010week, double\u2010blind, double\u2010dummy study to receive doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) 4\u2003mg q.i.d. (n\u2003=\u200382) or tamsulosin 0.4 q.i.d. (n\u2003=\u200383). Primary endpoints were the absolute and percentage change from baseline in symptoms measured by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Secondary endpoints included IPSS, quality\u2010of\u2010life (QOL) question from the IPSS, and questions 6 and 7 of the Sexual Function Abbreviated Questionnaire (SFAQ) at weeks 4 and 12. Doxazosin GITS and tamsulosin improved IPSS with no significant differences between groups at week 12. During weeks 4\u20138, tamsulosin\u2010treated patients demonstrated a slower improvement (p\u2003<\u20030.001) in IPSS than doxazosin GITS\u2010treated patients. The proportion of satisfied patients was observed earlier with doxazosin GITS (p\u2003=\u20030.006) vs \u2026"

On closer and more scientific inspection one finds that liquid crystals are generally composed of rod-shaped molecules, which exhibit an intermediate degree of order between solid and liquid. For example, in the nematic phase the elongated molecules are orientationally ordered along a particular axis, with no long range positional order. Since the molecules are also optically anisotropic, the polarization state of light may be altered as it passes through the liquid crystal, facilitating the brilliant display of colors. At lower temperatures partial positional order may set in, such that the molecules behave like a liquid in two dimensions, and are nearly solid-like in the third direction. This smectic phase has more than a dozen variations, each with its own characteristic symmetry. One of my central interests has been the experimental study of phase transitions from one liquid crystalline state to another. The goal of this work is to elucidate the fundamental character of these transitions, and their relationships to other phase changes in nature. I also have spent many years studying the behavior of liquid crystals at a solid interface. How does the interface align the molecules and how does it affect the phase transitions? Can we see analogies between the interface and the behavior in other systems, such as superconductors? Liquid crystals exhibit fascinating properties on very short length scales, the so-called nanoscopic scale. Using the stylus of an atomic force microscope, we scribe patterns onto a polymer-coated substrate as small as 10 nanometers in length, approximately one-ten thousandth the width of a human hair. The liquid crystal molecules are forced to align parallel to the scribing direction, allowing us to study phase transitions and elastic behavior on very tiny length scales. Along these lines, we recently developed a technique called Optical Nanotomography, where we immerse an ultra-thin optical fiber into a layer of liquid crystal and create a three-dimensional optical image of the liquid crystal\u2019s structure with resolution 1000 times better than other techniques.. A very different sort of scientific program involves controlling the gravitational forces on fluids by. applying an magnetic upward force. For all practical purposes, the fluid becomes weightless, allowing us to study a variety of phenomena. For example, a fluid that is tethered to two solid supports is known as a liquid bridge. Real-life examples include the fluid in the lungs, oil in porous rock, and water that wets a fabric. By studying these fluids in an effective zero-gravity environment, one learns about fluid stability, surface tension, and dynamics. Because the magnet force is controllable with time, we have performed experiments where we have oscillated gravity, and have examined the collapse of a cylindrical liquid bridge when gravity is suddenly turned on. Another research topic involves the Rayleigh- Taylor instability, which occurs when one places a dense fluid on top of a lighter fluid. Under ordinary gravity this arrangement is unstable, but one can stabilize this configuration by use of magnetic levitation of the (magnetic) heavier fluid. On turning off the field, an instability develops, and the heavier fluid falls to the bottom in a very complex manner. This phenomenon occurs in exploding supernovae, inertial confinement in fusion processes for purposes of energy generation, and even in vinegar and oil salad dressing!
