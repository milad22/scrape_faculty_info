We are interested in novel quantum phases of matter emergent from the strong electronic interactions in materials, which cannot be described by local order parameters. Using a combination of numerical and analytical approaches we will study the exotic physical properties of these topological phases, such as fractional charge\/statistics, robust edge\/surface states, and quantized response. We are also interested in the material realizations and experimental signatures of these topological phases, as well as associated novel quantum critical phenomena."
