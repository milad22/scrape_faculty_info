                "We have observed Bose-Einstein condensation of sodium atoms. The atoms were trapped in a novel trap that employed both magnetic and optical forces. Evaporative cooling increased the phase-space density by 6 orders of magnitude within seven seconds. Condensates contained up to 5\u00d7 10 5 atoms at densities exceeding 10 14 cm\u2212 3. The striking signature of Bose condensation was the sudden appearance of a bimodal velocity distribution below the critical temperature of\u223c 2\u03bcK. The distribution consisted of an isotropic thermal distribution and an elliptical core attributed to the expansion of a dense condensate.",
                "It has long been predicted that the scattering of ultracold atoms can be altered significantly through a so-called \u2018Feshbach resonance\u2019. Two such resonances have now been observed in optically trapped Bose\u2013Einstein condensates of sodium atoms by varying an external magnetic field. They gave rise to enhanced inelastic processes and a dispersive variation of the scattering length by a factor of over ten. These resonances open new possibilities for the study and manipulation of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates.",
                "Interference between two freely expanding Bose-Einstein condensates has been observed. Two condensates separated by \u223c40 micrometers were created by evaporatively cooling sodium atoms in a double-well potential formed by magnetic and optical forces. High-contrast matter-wave interference fringes with a period of \u223c15 micrometers were observed after switching off the potential and letting the condensates expand for 40 milliseconds and overlap. This demonstrates that Bose condensed atoms are \u201claser-like\u201d; that is, they are coherent and show long-range correlations. These results have direct implications for the atom laser and the Josephson effect for atoms.",
                "Bose-Einstein condensates of sodium atoms have been confined in an optical dipole trap using a single focused infrared laser beam. This eliminates the restrictions of magnetic traps for further studies of atom lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates. More than 5\u00d7 10 6 condensed atoms were transferred into the optical trap. Densities of up to 3\u00d7 10 15 cm\u2212 3 of Bose condensed atoms were obtained, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate constant for sodium condensates as K 3= 1.1 (3)\u00d7 10\u2212 30 cm 6 s\u2212 1. At lower densities, the observed 1\/e lifetime was longer than 10 s. Simultaneous confinement of Bose-Einstein condensates in several hyperfine states was demonstrated.",
                "Bose\u2013Einstein condensates\u2014a low-temperature form of matter in which a macroscopic population of bosons occupies the quantum-mechanical ground state\u2014have been demonstrated for weakly interacting, dilute gases of alkali-metal 1, 2, 3 and hydrogen 25 atoms. Magnetic traps are usually employed to confine the condensates, but have the drawback that spin flips in the atoms lead to untrapped states. For this reason, the spin orientation of the trapped alkali atoms cannot be regarded as a degree of freedom. Such condensates are therefore described by a scalar order parameter, like the spinless superfluid 4 He. In contrast, a recently realized optical trap 4 for sodium condensates confines atoms independently of their spin orientations. This offers the possibility of studying \u2018spinor\u2019condensates in which spin comprises a degree of freedom, so that the order parameter is a vector rather than scalar quantity. Here we \u2026",
                "We have demonstrated an output coupler for Bose condensed atoms in a magnetic trap. Short pulses of rf radiation were used to create Bose condensates in a superposition of trapped and untrapped hyperfine states. The fraction of out-coupled atoms was adjusted between 0% and 100% by varying the amplitude of the rf radiation. This configuration produces output pulses of coherent atoms and can be regarded as a pulsed \u201catom laser.\u201d",

                "A central goal in condensed matter and modern atomic physics is the exploration of quantum phases of matter\u2014in particular, how the universal characteristics of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions differ from those established for thermal phase transitions at non-zero temperature. Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For example, gaseous spinor Bose\u2013Einstein condensates 1, 2, 3 (whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87 Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and \u2026",
                "Properties of a Bose-Einstein condensate were studied by stimulated, two-photon Bragg scattering. The high momentum and energy resolution of this method allowed a spectroscopic measurement of the mean-field energy and of the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of the condensate. The coherence length of the condensate was shown to be equal to its size. Bragg spectroscopy can be used to determine the dynamic structure factor over a wide range of energy and momentum transfers.",
                "Collective excitations of a dilute Bose condensate have been observed. These excitations are analogous to phonons in superfluid helium. Bose condensates were created by evaporatively cooling magnetically trapped sodium atoms. Excitations were induced by a modulation of the trapping potential, and detected as shape oscillations in the freely expanding condensates. The frequencies of the lowest modes agreed well with theoretical predictions based on mean-field theory. Before the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation, we observed sound waves in a dense ultracold gas."
