                "Virginia Lorenz Associate Professor AMO \/ Quantum Physics 337A Loomis Laboratory (217) 300-3306 vlorenz@illinois.edu Lorenz research group website Professor Virginia Lorenz received her B.A. in physics magna cum laude and mathematics in 2001 and completed her Ph.D. in physics in 2007 at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Her thesis work focused on measuring and modelling the transition from reversible to irreversible dephasing of electronic coherence in dense atomic vapors. From 2007-2009 Professor Lorenz was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the University of Oxford, where she worked on implementations of quantum memories in atomic and solid state systems. From 2009-2014, she was an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Delaware, performing research in the areas of photonic quantum state generation, single-photon-level spectroscopy, and optical magnetometry of spin-orbit interactions in heavy metal \/ ferromagnetic metal systems. She joined the Department of Physics at Illinois in January 2015. Professor Lorenz's research group performs experiments in three major  areas: quantum optics, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, and optical  magnetometry. Photonic quantum state characterization and engineering The ability to create and control quantum states of light is important  for quantum computation and quantum communication applications. We are  exploring the use of standard, commercially available  polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) as a simple source of photon-pairs.  PMF is an efficient generator of photon pairs and its large  birefringence yields a 60THz detuning of the photon' phase-matched  wavelengths from the pump, thus almost eliminating contamination due to  photons produced from Raman scattering, which is an issue in other types  of fiber sources. The joint spectral properties of the photon pair can  be tailored by an appropriate choice of pump bandwidth and fiber length.  We are implementing a newly developed stimulated-emission-based scheme  to measure joint properties of the photon-pairs. Generation, storage and retrieval of THz bandwidth quantum states An essential capability for quantum computation and quantum  communication is the synchronization of multiple sub-device elements,  which requires a so-called quantum memory to store and retrieve  information carried by photons. We are applying an off-resonance Raman  protocol in atomic barium vapor to store and retrieve THz bandwidth  quantum states. The broad bandwidth of the involved fields permits the  characterization and optimization of storage and retrieval using  spectral shaping, and enables us to study the spectral properties of  nonclassical correlations between the photons and the excitations in the  atomic ensemble. Barium has a strong transition at the fortuitous  wavelength of 1500 nm, meaning it can store telecom wavelength photons  directly. We are characterizing the states that the memory stores and  retrieves using new techniques based on stimulated emission. Development of spectroscopic techniques to probe coherence dynamics Quantum applications such as the photon-pair source and quantum memory  described above utilize single-photon detection and coincidence counting  to quantify correlations. These tools can in turn be used to understand  the dynamics of the materials from which the photons are generated. From  the spectroscopy perspective, the motivation is to understand complex  systems such as molecular liquids, in which inhomogeneous broadening  dominates and multiple states couple to each other, in order to harness  the chemical dynamics. To that end, we are developing single-excitation,  single-photon-level techniques to understanding the complex structural  correlations and environmental conditions surrounding molecules in  liquids. We are exploring the capabilities of transient coherent Raman  scattering in measuring the dynamics of liquid mixtures and the  possibilities for using coincidence detection to measure vibrational  energy redistribution, a complex phenomenon due to the intricate  couplings and variety of timescales involved. Spin-orbit interaction driven phenomena in ferromagnetic \/ heavy metal  bilayers In the context of classical information storage and processing,  spintronics, which uses the spin of the electron as an information  carrier, holds promise for the creation of reliable, energy-efficient,  easily scalable resources for next-generation computing. One method to  manipulate electron spin is via the spin-orbit interaction, in which an  electric current exerts a torque on the magnetization, and recently the  implementation of spin-orbit-interaction induced switching in heavy  metal (HM) \/ ferromagnetic metal (FM) bilayers has attracted great  attention. Although beneficial effects have been successfully  demonstrated, researchers are still debating the underlying principles,  as to whether the dominating spin-orbit interaction (SOI) arises from  the HM\/FM interface due to the Rashba effect or from the bulk of the HM  due to the spin Hall effect. We have developed a magneto-optic Kerr  effect magnetometer that is capable of detecting SOI induced  magnetization reorientation. Using this technique, we are studying and  quantifying the bulk and interface contributions to spin-orbit  interaction in a variety of materials.

Education Physics faculty, teaching assistants bring hands-on lab to students online When Physics senior lecturer Eugene Colla begins remotely teaching his Modern Experimental Physics course in June, he\u2019ll be ready. Colla and his co-instructor, Prof. Virginia (Gina) Lorenz, collaborated with physics teaching lab specialist, Jack Boparai, and a team of teaching assistants to successfully convert the course to virtual instruction midway through spring semester in response to COVID-19. Online conversion was no small feat for Colla, who has taught Physics 403 since 2004 and has watched the class size more than double in that time. The spring semester saw 28 students, including three exchange students from the United Kingdom. Illinois researchers create first three-photon color-entangled W state Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have constructed a quantum-mechanical state in which the colors of three photons are entangled with each other. The state is a special combination, called a W state, that retains some entanglement even if one of the three photons is lost, which makes it useful for quantum communication. Such entangled states also enable novel quantum applications and tests of fundamental physics.  The uniqueness of this work is that the researchers used color, or the energy of the photons, as the entangling degree of freedom, while previous work used polarization. The energy of a photon cannot be easily changed, which reduces the possibility of errors when the energy-entangled W state is propagating over a long distance. The state was verified for the first time by measuring information about the two-photon sub-systems. Their findings are published in Physical Review Letters . Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics A Torque on Conventional Magnetic Wisdom Physicists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have observed a magnetic phenomenon called the \u201canomalous spin-orbit torque\u201d (ASOT) for the first time. Professor Virginia Lorenz and graduate student Wenrui Wang, now graduated and employed as an industry scientist, made this observation, demonstrating that there exists competition between what is known as spin-orbit coupling and the alignment of an electron spin to the magnetization. This can be thought of as analogous to the anomalous Hall effect (AHE)."
