Together with dark matter, dark energy, the field(s) responsible for inflation, and neutrino masses, these fundamental questions about the nature of the universe all point to physics beyond the Standard Model. Gilman served as Director of the McWilliams Center for Cosmology, and has been a member of LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration from the time of its creation. He is the Chair of the AURA Management Council for the LSST (AMCL), the committee that oversees the construction and commissioning of the LSST Project, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA).
