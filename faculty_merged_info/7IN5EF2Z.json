                "The National Ignition Campaign (NIC) was a multi-institution effort established under the National Nuclear Security Administration of DOE in 2005, prior to the completion of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in 2009. The scope of the NIC was the planning and preparation for and the execution of the first 3 yr of ignition experiments (through the end of September 2012) as well as the development, fielding, qualification, and integration of the wide range of capabilities required for ignition. Besides the operation and optimization of the use of NIF, these capabilities included over 50 optical, x-ray, and nuclear diagnostic systems, target fabrication facilities, experimental platforms, and a wide range of NIF facility infrastructure. The goal of ignition experiments on the NIF is to achieve, for the first time, ignition and thermonuclear burn in the laboratory via inertial confinement fusion and to develop a platform for ignition and high \u2026",
                "High-resolution spectrometry of charged particles from inertial-confinement-fusion (ICF) experiments has become an important method of studying plasma conditions in laser-compressed capsules. In experiments at the 60-beam OMEGA laser facility [T. R. Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)], utilizing capsules with D2, D3He, DT, or DTH fuel in a shell of plastic, glass, or D2 ice, we now routinely make spectral measurements of primary fusion products (p, D, T, 3He, \u03b1), secondary fusion products (p), \u201cknock-on\u201d particles (p, D, T) elastically scattered by primary neutrons, and ions from the shell. Use is made of several types of spectrometers that rely on detection and identification of particles with CR-39 nuclear track detectors in conjunction with magnets and\/or special ranging filters. CR-39 is especially useful because of its insensitivity to electromagnetic noise and its ability to distinguish the types and \u2026",
                "Electromagnetic (E\/B) fields generated by the interaction with plasmas of long-pulse, low-intensity laser beams relevant to inertial confinement fusion have been measured for the first time using novel monoenergetic proton radiography methods. High-resolution, time-gated radiography images of a plastic foil driven by a 10 14 W\/cm 2 laser implied B fields of\u223c 0.5 MG and E fields of\u223c 1.5\u00d7 10 8 V\/m. Simulations of these experiments with LASNEX+ LSP have been performed and are in overall (though not exact) agreement with the data both for field strengths and for spatial distributions; this is the first direct experimental test of the laser-generated B-field package in LASNEX. The experiments also demonstrated that laser phase plates substantially reduce medium-scale chaotic field structure.",
                "A distinctive way of quantitatively imaging inertial fusion implosions has resulted in the characterization of two different types of electromagnetic configurations and in the measurement of the temporal evolution of capsule size and areal density. Radiography with a pulsed, monoenergetic, isotropic proton source reveals field structures through deflection of proton trajectories, and areal densities are quantified through the energy lost by protons while traversing the plasma. The two field structures consist of (i) many radial filaments with complex striations and bifurcations, permeating the entire field of view, of magnetic field magnitude 60 tesla and (ii) a coherent, centrally directed electric field of order 109 volts per meter, seen in proximity to the capsule surface. Although the mechanism for generating these fields is unclear, their effect on implosion dynamics is potentially consequential.",
                "The spatial structure and temporal evolution of megagauss magnetic fields generated by interactions of up to 4 laser beams with matter were studied with an innovative, time-gated proton radiography method that produces images of unprecedented clarity because it uses an isotropic, truly monoenergetic backlighter (14.7-MeV protons from D He 3 nuclear fusion reactions). Quantitative field maps reveal precisely and directly, for the first time, changes in the magnetic topology due to reconnection in a high-energy-density plasma (n e\u223c 10 20\u201310 22 cm\u2212 3, T e\u223c 1 keV).",
                "The \u201cHigh-Foot\u201d platform manipulates the laser pulse-shape coming from the National Ignition Facility laser to create an indirect drive 3-shock implosion that is significantly more robust against instability growth involving the ablator and also modestly reduces implosion convergence ratio. This strategy gives up on theoretical high-gain in an inertial confinement fusion implosion in order to obtain better control of the implosion and bring experimental performance in-line with calculated performance, yet keeps the absolute capsule performance relatively high. In this paper, we will cover the various experimental and theoretical motivations for the high-foot drive as well as cover the experimental results that have come out of the high-foot experimental campaign. At the time of this writing, the high-foot implosion has demonstrated record total deuterium-tritium yields (9.3\u00d71015) with low levels of inferred mix, excellent \u2026",
                "First measurements of the in-flight shape of imploding inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsules at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) were obtained by using two-dimensional x-ray radiography. The sequence of area-backlit, time-gated pinhole images is analyzed for implosion velocity, low-mode shape and density asymmetries, and the absolute offset and center-of-mass velocity of the capsule shell. The in-flight shell is often observed to be asymmetric even when the concomitant core self-emission is round. A\u223c 15 \u03bc m shell asymmetry amplitude of the Y 40 spherical harmonic mode was observed for standard NIF ICF hohlraums at a shell radius of\u223c 200 \u03bc m (capsule at\u223c 5\u00d7 radial compression). This asymmetry is mitigated by a\u223c 10% increase in the hohlraum length.",
                "Magnesium oxide is an important component of the Earth\u2019s mantle and has been extensively studied at pressures and temperatures relevant to Earth 1. However, much less is known about the behaviour of this oxide under conditions likely to occur in extrasolar planets with masses up to 10 times that of Earth, termed super-Earths, where pressures can exceed 1,000 GPa (10 million atmospheres). Magnesium oxide is expected to change from a rocksalt crystal structure (B1) to a caesium chloride (B2) structure at pressures of about 400\u2013600 GPa (refs 2, 3). Whereas no structural transformation was observed in static compression experiments up to 250 GPa (ref. 4), evidence for a solid\u2013solid phase transition was obtained in shockwave experiments above 400 GPa and 9,000 K (ref. 5), albeit no structural measurements were made. As a result, the properties and the structure of MgO under conditions relevant to super \u2026",
                "Measurements have been made of the in-flight dynamics of imploding capsules indirectly driven by laser energies of 1\u20131.7\u2009MJ at the National Ignition Facility [Miller et al., Nucl. Fusion 44, 228 (2004)]. These experiments were part of the National Ignition Campaign [Landen et al., Phys. Plasmas 18, 051002 (2011)] to iteratively optimize the inputs required to achieve thermonuclear ignition in the laboratory. Using gated or streaked hard x-ray radiography, a suite of ablator performance parameters, including the time-resolved radius, velocity, mass, and thickness, have been determined throughout the acceleration history of surrogate gas-filled implosions. These measurements have been used to establish a dynamically consistent model of the ablative drive history and shell compressibility throughout the implosion trajectory. First results showed that the peak velocity of the original 1.3-MJ Ge-doped polymer (CH \u2026",
                "High Density Carbon (HDC) is a leading candidate as an ablator material for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) capsules in x-ray (indirect) drive implosions. HDC has a higher density (3.5\u2009g\/cc) than plastic (CH, 1\u2009g\/cc), which results in a thinner ablator with a larger inner radius for a given capsule scale. This leads to higher x-ray absorption and shorter laser pulses compared to equivalent CH designs. This paper will describe a series of experiments carried out to examine the feasibility of using HDC as an ablator using both gas filled hohlraums and lower density, near vacuum hohlraums. These experiments have shown that deuterium (DD) and deuterium-tritium gas filled HDC capsules driven by a hohlraum filled with 1.2\u2009mg\/cc He gas, produce neutron yields a factor of 2\u00d7 higher than equivalent CH implosions, representing better than 50% Yield-over-Clean (YoC). In a near vacuum hohlraum (He\u2009=\u20090.03\u2009mg\/cc \u2026"
