                "We demonstrate the inscription of fiber Bragg gratings by 193 nm ArF excimer laser in microfibers drawn from the standard single mode telecommunication fiber. Fiber Bragg gratings are directly inscribed in a series of microfibers with diameter ranged from tens of \u03bcm to 3.3 \u03bcm without hydrogen loading or other treatment to photosensitize the microfibers. Four reflection peaks are observed where three correspond to high order mode resonances. The resonance wavelength depends on the fiber diameter and it sharply blueshifts as the diameter is decreased below 10 \u03bcm. The gratings are characterized for their response to ambient refractive index. The higher order mode resonance exhibits higher sensitivity to refractive index.",
                "We demonstrate an ultrasensitive refractive-index (RI) sensor utilizing the polarimetric interference of a rectangular silica microfiber. The measured sensitivity is as high as 18,987?nm\/RIU (refractive-index unit) around the RI of 1.33, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the previously reported microfiber devices. Theoretical analysis reveals that such high sensitivity not only is originated from the RI-induced birefringence variation but also relies on the unique birefringence dispersion property for the rectangular microfiber. We predict that the sensitivity can be enhanced significantly when the group birefringence approaches zero.",
                "A label-free fiber-optic biosensor with a reflective microfiber Bragg grating (mFBG) configuration for in-situ DNA hybridization detection has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A single straight Bragg grating inscribed in the silica microfiber provides two well-defined resonances in reflection, which show different response to external medium refractive index (RI) and present the same temperature sensitivity. By monitoring the wavelength separation between these two resonances, temperature-compensated RI measurement has been achieved. The label-free bio-recognition scheme used demonstrates that the sensor relies on the surface functionalization of a monolayer of poly-l-lysine (PLL), synthetic DNA sequences that bind with high specificity to a given target. In addition to monitoring the surface functionalization of the fiber in real-time, the results also show how the fiber biosensor can detect the \u2026",
                "In this paper, we demonstrate high-efficiency inscription of Bragg gratings in microfiber. Strong Bragg gratings are easily inscribed using a 193-nm excimer laser and phase mask in microfiber drawn from the 62.5\/125- \u03bcm standard multimode fiber (MMF) with no additional photosensitization treatment. The enlarged photosensitive core offered by the MMF provides a sufficient overlap between the fundamental mode and the induced refractive index modulation region, which significantly enhances the grating inscription efficiency. The grating inscription in the microfiber is even more efficient than that in the original MMF because the multibeam interference-induced fringe fuzziness in the normal size fiber does not occur as the fiber diameter down to the scale that is comparable with the Talbot length of the ultraviolet (UV)-writing light. The proposed method is beneficial for sensing and device applications of microfiber \u2026",
                "A sensitive bio-probe to in situ detect unlabeled single-stranded DNA targets based on optical microfiber taper interferometer coated by a high ordered pore arrays conjugated polymer has been presented. The polymer coating serves as tentacles to catch single-stranded DNA molecules by \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugated interaction and varies the surface refractive index of the optical microfiber. The microfiber taper interferometer translates the refractive index information into wavelength shift of the interference fringe. The sensor exhibits DNA concentration sensitivity of 2.393 nm\/log M and the lowest detection ability of 10^\u221210 M or even lower.",
                "A relative humidity (RH) sensor based on a microfiber Sagnac loop interferometer is proposed and demonstrated. The sensor is formed by fusion splicing a high-birefringence elliptical microfiber into a fiber loop mirror without any humidity sensitive coating to the structure. Interferometric fringe with visibility of around 30 dB can be achieved in the transmission spectrum due to phase difference between the two polarization modes travelling through the microfiber region. The proposed structure presents high sensitivity up to \u223c201.25 pm\/%RH, within an RH range from 30%RH to 90%RH. Moreover, we realize the sensitivity enhancement (up to \u223c422.2 pm\/%RH) by inserting a reference Panda fiber into the fiber loop. The sensitivity is two to five times of magnitude higher than the counterparts in the literature. The measured response time is around 60 ms, which is much better than the previously-reported devices.",
                "We present fiber Bragg grating fabricated in rectangular microfiber for temperature-independent refractive index (RI) measurement. The grating has two Bragg peaks due to the high geometrical birefringence of the rectangular microfiber. The two peaks present different RI responses because the modes along the orthogonal polarizations have different energy fractions in terms of evanescent field outside the silica microfiber and hence the light\/liquid interaction strength are different. In contrast, they exhibit identical temperature sensitivities because most mode energy is confined in the microfiber and the thermal-optic effect of silica dominantly determines the temperature response. As a result, temperature-independent RI sensing can be realized by monitoring the wavelength separation between the two peaks.",
                "Microfiber Bragg gratings (mFBGs) are of great promise due to their compactness, large evanescent field effect, low stiffness, and good flexibility. A lot of researches related to the fabrication and the potential applications of mFBGs in sensing and communication have been made in the past. This review begins from the theoretical analysis based on the mode coupling effect. Then, the fabrication techniques for the refractive index-changed and the structural mFBGs are described. The sensing applications for the measurands of refractive index, force, and magnetic field, and the applications for realizing functional devices, including optical tunable filters, temperature-compensated filters, and Fabry-Perot cavities are discussed.",
                "Fiber optics evanescent field based biosensor is an excellent candidate for label-free detection of cardiac biomarkers which is of great importance in rapid, early, and accurate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this paper, we report a compact and sensitive cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) immunosensor based on the phase-shifted microfiber Bragg grating probe which is functionalized. The fine reflective signal induced by the phase shift in modulation significantly improves the spectral resolution, enabling the ability of the sensor in perceiving an ultra-small refractive index change due to the specific capture of the cTn-I antigens. In buffer, a log-linear sensing range from 0.1 to 10 ng\/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 ng\/mL (predicted to be as low as 10.8 pg\/mL) are obtained. Furthermore, with good specificity, the sensor can be applied in test of cTn-I in human serum samples. The proposed sensor \u2026",
                "A directional vibration sensor based on polarization-controlled cladding-to-core recoupling is demonstrated. A compact structure in which a short section of multi-mode fiber (MMF) stub containing a weakly tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) is spliced to another single-mode fiber without any lateral offset. Multiple core modes of the MMF are coupled at the junction and appear as well defined resonances in reflection from the TFBG. Some of those resonances exhibit a strong polarization and bending dependence. Both the orientation and the amplitude of the vibrations can be determined unambiguously via dual-path power detection of the orthogonal-polarimetric lowest order LP_1n modes. Meanwhile, the unwanted power fluctuations and temperature perturbations can be referenced out by monitoring the fundamental LP_01 mode resonance."
