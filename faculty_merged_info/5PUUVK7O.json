                "Graphene\u2019s success has shown that it is possible to create stable, single and few-atom-thick layers of van der Waals materials, and also that these materials can exhibit fascinating and technologically useful properties. Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface. Finally, we highlight \u2026",
                "Ultrathin amorphous Bi films, patterned with a nanohoneycomb array of holes, can exhibit an insulating phase with transport dominated by the incoherent motion of Cooper pairs (CP) of electrons between localized states. Here, we show that the magnetoresistance (MR) of this Cooper pair insulator (CPI) phase is positive and grows exponentially with decreasing temperature T, for T well below the pair formation temperature. It peaks at a field estimated to be sufficient to break the pairs and then decreases monotonically into a regime in which the film resistance assumes the T dependence appropriate for weakly localized single electron transport. We discuss how these results support proposals that the large MR peaks in other unpatterned, ultrathin film systems disclose a CPI phase and provide new insight into the CP localization.",
                "Ultrathin films near the quantum insulator-superconductor transition (IST) can exhibit Cooper-pair transport in their insulating state. This Cooper-pair insulator (CPI) state is achieved in amorphous Bi films evaporated onto substrates with a topography varying on lengths slightly greater than the superconducting coherence length. We present evidence that this topography induces film thickness and corresponding superconducting coupling constant variations that promote Cooper-pair island formation. Analyses of many thickness-tuned ISTs show that weak links between superconducting islands dominate the transport. In particular, the IST occurs when the link resistance approaches the resistance quantum for pairs. These results support conjectures that the CPI is an inhomogeneous state of matter.",
                "We present investigations of the superconductor-to-insulator transition (SIT) of uniform a-Bi films using a technique sensitive to Cooper pair phase coherence. The films are perforated with a nanohoneycomb array of holes to form a multiply connected geometry and subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. Film magnetoresistances on the superconducting side of the SIT oscillate with a period dictated by the superconducting flux quantum and the areal hole density. The oscillations disappear close to the SIT critical point to leave a monotonically rising magnetoresistance that persists in the insulating phase. These observations indicate that the Cooper pair phase coherence length, which is infinite in the superconducting phase, collapses to a value less than the interhole spacing at this SIT. This behavior is inconsistent with the gradual reduction of the phase coherence length expected for a bosonic phase \u2026",
                "Black phosphorus (BP) is receiving significant attention because of its direct 0.4\u20131.5\u2009eV layer-dependent bandgap and high mobility. Because BP devices rely on exfoliation from bulk crystals, there is a need to understand the native impurities and defects in the source material. In particular, samples are typically p-doped, but the source of the doping is not well understood. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to compare the atomic defects of BP samples from two commercial sources. Even though the sources produced crystals with an order of magnitude difference in impurity atoms, we observed a similar defect density and level of p-doping. We attribute these defects to phosphorus vacancies and provide evidence that they are the source of p-doping. We also compare these native defects to those induced by air exposure and show that they are distinct and likely more important for the \u2026",

                "We report thermal-expansion and magnetostriction results on Ce 0.6 La 0.4 RhIn 5 single crystals. This particular La concentration (x c\u223c 0. 4) corresponds to the critical one at which the long-range magnetic order vanishes (T N= 0). However, as also observed in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements, a large \u201chump\u201d is seen in thermal-expansion at T SR\u223c 4.5 K. This anomaly, claimed to be related to short-range correlations, is observed only along the c axis, confirming that anisotropy plays an important role in these 115 compounds. No particular feature is associated with the magnetic correlations in the magnetostriction measurements. The magnetic field dependence of the volume is quadratic in field as expected for a paramagnetic system, above and below T SR. Finally, the magnetic field dependence of the crystal electric field contribution to the thermal expansion seems to reinforce the idea \u2026",
                "We present a study of graphene\/substrate interactions on ultrahigh-vacuum-grown graphene islands with minimal surface contamination using in situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. We compare the physical and electronic structure of the sample surface with atomic spatial resolution on graphene islands versus regions of bare Cu (111) substrate. We find that the Rydberg-like series of image potential states is shifted toward lower energy over the graphene islands relative to Cu (111), indicating a decrease in the local work function, and the resonances have a much smaller linewidth, indicating reduced coupling to the bulk. In addition, we show the dispersion of the occupied Cu (111) Shockley surface state is influenced by the graphene layer, and both the band edge and effective mass are shifted relative to bare Cu (111).",
                "We have developed a novel method for crystalline hydrogenation of graphene on the nanoscale. Molecular hydrogen was physisorbed at 5 K onto pristine graphene islands grown on Cu(111) in ultrahigh vacuum. Field emission local to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope dissociates H2 and results in hydrogenated graphene. At lower coverage, isolated point defects are found on the graphene and are attributed to chemisorbed H on top and bottom surfaces. Repeated H2 exposure and field emission yielded patches and then complete coverage of a crystalline \u221a3 \u00d7 \u221a3 R30\u00b0 phase, as well as less densely packed 3 \u00d7 3 and 4 \u00d7 4 structures. The hydrogenation can be reversed by imaging with higher bias voltage."
