                "Popularization of portable electronics and electric vehicles worldwide stimulates the development of energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, toward higher power density and energy density, which significantly depends upon the advancement of new materials used in these devices. Moreover, energy storage materials play a key role in efficient, clean, and versatile use of energy, and are crucial for the exploitation of renewable energy. Therefore, energy storage materials cover a wide range of materials and have been receiving intensive attention from research and development to industrialization. In this Review, firstly a general introduction is given to several typical energy storage systems, including thermal, mechanical, electromagnetic, hydrogen, and electrochemical energy storage. Then the current status of high\u2010performance hydrogen storage materials for on\u2010board applications and \u2026",
                "Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene \u2026",
                "Owing to their scientific and technological importance, inorganic single crystals with highly reactive surfaces have long been studied 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Unfortunately, surfaces with high reactivity usually diminish rapidly during the crystal growth process as a result of the minimization of surface energy. A typical example is titanium dioxide (TiO 2), which has promising energy and environmental applications 14, 15, 16, 17. Most available anatase TiO 2 crystals are dominated by the thermodynamically stable {101} facets (more than 94 per cent, according to the Wulff construction 10), rather than the much more reactive {001} facets 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20. Here we demonstrate that for fluorine-terminated surfaces this relative stability is reversed:{001} is energetically preferable to {101}. We explored this effect systematically for a range of non-metallic adsorbate atoms by first-principle quantum \u2026",
                "Integration of individual two-dimensional graphene sheets 1, 2, 3 into macroscopic structures is essential for the application of graphene. A series of graphene-based composites 4, 5, 6 and macroscopic structures 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 have been recently fabricated using chemically derived graphene sheets. However, these composites and structures suffer from poor electrical conductivity because of the low quality and\/or high inter-sheet junction contact resistance of the chemically derived graphene sheets. Here we report the direct synthesis of three-dimensional foam-like graphene macrostructures, which we call graphene foams (GFs), by template-directed chemical vapour deposition. A GF consists of an interconnected flexible network of graphene as the fast transport channel of charge carriers for high electrical conductivity. Even with a GF loading as low as\u223c 0.5 wt%, GF\/poly (dimethyl siloxane) composites show a \u2026",
                "Masses of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a large mean diameter of about 1.85 nanometers, synthesized by a semicontinuous hydrogen arc discharge method, were employed for hydrogen adsorption experiments in their as-prepared and pretreated states. A hydrogen storage capacity of 4.2 weight percent, or a hydrogen to carbon atom ratio of 0.52, was achieved reproducibly at room temperature under a modestly high pressure (about 10 megapascal) for a SWNT sample of about 500 milligram weight that was soaked in hydrochloric acid and then heat-treated in vacuum. Moreover, 78.3 percent of the adsorbed hydrogen (3.3 weight percent) could be released under ambient pressure at room temperature, while the release of the residual stored hydrogen (0.9 weight percent) required some heating of the sample. Because the SWNTs can be easily produced and show reproducible and modestly \u2026",
                "We report a facile strategy to synthesize the nanocomposite of Co3O4 nanoparticles anchored on conducting graphene as an advanced anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. The Co3O4 nanoparticles obtained are 10\u221230 nm in size and homogeneously anchor on graphene sheets as spacers to keep the neighboring sheets separated. This Co3O4\/graphene nanocomposite displays superior Li-battery performance with large reversible capacity, excellent cyclic performance, and good rate capability, highlighting the importance of the anchoring of nanoparticles on graphene sheets for maximum utilization of electrochemically active Co3O4 nanoparticles and graphene for energy storage applications in high-performance lithium-ion batteries.",
                "\u201cGraphitic\u201d (g)\u2010C3N4 with a layered structure has the potential of forming graphene\u2010like nanosheets with unusual physicochemical properties due to weak van der Waals forces between layers. Herein is shown that g\u2010C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of around 2 nm can be easily obtained by a simple top\u2010down strategy, namely, thermal oxidation etching of bulk g\u2010C3N4 in air. Compared to the bulk g\u2010C3N4, the highly anisotropic 2D\u2010nanosheets possess a high specific surface area of 306 m2 g\u22121, a larger bandgap (by 0.2 eV), improved electron transport ability along the in\u2010plane direction, and increased lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers because of the quantum confinement effect. As a consequence, the photocatalytic activities of g\u2010C3N4 nanosheets have been remarkably improved in terms of \u2022OH radical generation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.",

The properties of this new material combine to overcome the electrode kinetic problems normally found in electrochemical capacitors, thus resulting in an excellent high\u2010rate energy\u2010storage performance.",
                "A well-organized flexible interleaved composite of graphene nanosheets (GNSs) decorated with Fe3O4 particles was synthesized through in situ reduction of iron hydroxide between GNSs. The GNS\/Fe3O4 composite shows a reversible specific capacity approaching 1026 mA h g\u22121 after 30 cycles at 35 mA g\u22121 and 580 mAh g\u22121 after 100 cycles at 700 mA g\u22121as well as improved cyclic stability and excellent rate capability. The multifunctional features of the GNS\/Fe3O4 composite are considered as follows: (i) GNSs play a \u201cflexible confinement\u201d function to enwrap Fe3O4 particles, which can compensate for the volume change of Fe3O4 and prevent the detachment and agglomeration of pulverized Fe3O4, thus extending the cycling life of the electrode; (ii) GNSs provide a large contact surface for individual dispersion of well-adhered Fe3O4 particles and act as an excellent conductive agent to provide a highway for \u2026",
                "One great challenge in the development of lithium ion batteries is to simultaneously achieve high power and large energy capacity at fast charge and discharge rates for several minutes to seconds. Here we show that nitrogen- or boron-doped graphene can be used as a promising anode for high-power and high-energy lithium ion batteries under high-rate charge and discharge conditions. The doped graphene shows a high reversible capacity of >1040 mAh g\u20131 at a low rate of 50 mA g\u20131. More importantly, it can be quickly charged and discharged in a very short time of 1 h to several tens of seconds together with high-rate capability and excellent long-term cyclability. For example, a very high capacity of \u223c199 and 235 mAh g\u20131 was obtained for the N-doped graphene and B-doped graphene at 25 A g\u20131 (about 30 s to full charge).

Professor Chen has pioneered the field of reverse Cherenkov Radiation (RCR) in left-handed material since 2003, after working on Particles Physics for 30 years highlighted with the discovery of the J-Particle in 1974 and the Gluons, the carrier of the Nuclear Forces, in 1979 and the study of the properties of the Weak Bosons over the period 1985 to 1995: 1970: personally, designed to build a precision vertical bending double arm mass spectrometer, later leading to the discovery of the J-particle, not predicted by theory. 1974: first eliminates the background to find the sharp J-particle peak, showing the composite properties of a new heavy (Charm) quark-antiquark composite system, establishing the quark model that quarks are the basic building block of everything in the universe. 1976: invited to participate in the Nobel Prize ceremony for the experimental group leader Prof. S. C. C. Ting due to the discovery of J-particle. 1979: developed a new mathematical method to calculate the energy distribution of the hadrons produced by high energy positive and negative electron collisions, leading to the discovery of 3-jets and the carrier of the Nuclear forces, the Gluons. 1983: Fellow of Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. 1995: European Institute of Physics Nuclear Force carrier \u2013 Group Gluon Discovery Award. 2003: Launching the study of the backward Cherenkov radiation using man-made left-hand material. 2010: The backward Cherenkov radiation paper won the best paper award from the IEEE International Electromagnetism Application Conference. 2012: Invited by the President of Taiwan University to participate in the assessment of university academic courses. 2013: Awarded Outstanding Contribution Award for Academic Course Evaluation of Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao tong University. 2013: Introduced the MIT-edX course to Taiwan and invited 14 well-known Taiwanese educators to MIT to learn MIT's MOOCS. 2014: Phi-Tau-Phi Academic Honors Award. 2013-2014-2015-2016, lectured at the University of Macau, Tunghai University, Electronic Science and Technology University, Zhejiang University on 1. Science and Humanities; 2. Methods of Major Scientific Discoveries; 3. Method of Developing the Standard Theory, and 4. Network teaching Methods. 2017 First Direct Observation of Backward Cherenkov Radiation in Electron Beams. He did both the theoretical prediction and computation, designed the first meta-material for RCR, which is transverse magnetic field, versus all the previous meta material being for transverse electric waves only, and he made the first convincing experimental demonstration of RCR. In 1995, he got European Physics Society Prize for the discovery of the Gluon, the carrier of the Nuclear Forces. In 2010, he got the \"Best Paper Award\" granted by 2010 International Conference EEE on Application of Electromagnetism for his experimental verification of reversed Cherenkov radiation in left-handed material, which was also in the discovery story for the January 2010 issue of Photonics Spectra (www.photonics.com). Recently he has developed a new method and obtained a patent in China and in the USA, to generate enhanced terahertz (THz) surface wave (SW) via its coupling with reversed Cherenkov radiation (RCR), excited by a sheet beam bunch which travels in a vacuum above an isotropic double negative metamaterial (DNM). The physical mechanism for the enhancement is that this DNM can support a RCR which can resonantly interact with a sheet electron beam bunch, resulting in an enhanced SW, formed due to its coupling with the enhanced RCR. Numerical results show strong enhancement for the SW and RCR in the THz band. This enhanced THz radiation has potential applications to high-power THz radiation sources and Cherenkov detectors which require large signals. He has made the theoretical computation and is now testing the Babinet principle which relates the polarization of the radiation emitted by a meta material with that emitted by its meta complementary surface. \"Determination of Strong Interaction Nuclear Radii\", Phys.
