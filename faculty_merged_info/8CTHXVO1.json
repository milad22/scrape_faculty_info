This work includes the use of weak gravitational lensing and other analysis techniques, with projects that range from development of improved data analysis methods, to actual application of such methods to existing data. Currently, I am focusing on data from the SDSS (including SDSS-III and the ongoing SDSS-IV) and Hyper-SuprimeCam (HSC), and am working on upcoming surveys including LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. I am currently serving as Spokesperson of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration .
