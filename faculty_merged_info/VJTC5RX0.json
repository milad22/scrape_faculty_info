                "The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift (z) range 8-1.5. It will image> 250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z> 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 10 9 M\u2609 to z\u2248 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z\u2248 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin 2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS\/Deep survey (5\u03c3 point-source limit \u2026",

This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z\u2248 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z> 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3\/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet\/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS\/Deep survey covers~ 125 arcmin 2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS\/Wide survey, achieving a total of~ 800 arcmin 2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep \u2026",
                "Major advances in our understanding of the universe have historically arisen from dramatic improvements in our ability to \u201csee.\u201d We have developed progressively larger telescopes over the past century, allowing us to peer further into space, and further back in time. With the development of advanced instrumentation\u2014imagers, spectrographs, and polarimeters\u2014we have been able to parse radiation detected from distant sources over the full electromagnetic spectrum in increasingly subtle ways. These data have provided the detailed information needed to construct physical models of planets, stars, galaxies, quasars, and larger structures and to probe the new physics of dark matter and dark energy.Until recently, most astronomical investigations have focused on small samples of cosmic sources or individual objects. This is because our largest telescope facilities typically had rather small fields of view, and those \u2026",
                "Observations of damped Ly\u03b1 systems offer a unique window on the neutral-gas reservoirs that gave rise to galaxies at high redshifts. This review focuses on critical properties such as the H I and metal content of the gas and on independent evidence for star formation. Together, these provide an emerging picture of gravitationally bound objects in which accretion of gas from the IGM replenishes gas consumed by star formation. Other properties such as dust content, molecular content, ionized-gas content, gas kinematics, and galaxy identifications are also reviewed. These properties point to a multiphase ISM in which radiative and hydrodynamic feedback processes are present. Numerical simulations and other types of models used to describe damped Ly\u03b1 systems within the context of galaxy formation are also discussed.",
                "We present a sensitive 870 \u03bcm survey of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) combining 310 hr of observing time with the Large Apex BOlometer Camera (LABOCA) on the APEX telescope. The LABOCA ECDFS Submillimetre Survey (LESS) covers the full 30'\u00d7 30'field size of the ECDFS and has a uniform noise level of \u03c3 870 \u03bcm\u2248 1.2 mJy beam\u20131. LESS is thus the largest contiguous deep submillimeter survey undertaken to date. The noise properties of our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected by confusion noise. We present a catalog of 126 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) detected with a significance level above 3.7 \u03c3, at which level we expect five false detections given our map area of 1260 arcmin 2. The ECDFS exhibits a deficit of bright SMGs relative to previously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies that dominate the extragalactic background light \u2026",
                "We describe the results of an extremely deep, 0.28 deg2 survey for   Ly\u03b1 emission\u2010line galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field\u2013South. By using a narrowband 5000 \u00c5 filter and complementary broadband photometry from the MUSYC survey, we identify a statistically complete sample of 162 galaxies with monochromatic fluxes brighter than   ergs cm  s  and observer's frame equivalent widths greater than 80 \u00c5. We show that the equivalent width distribution of these objects follows an exponential with a rest\u2010frame scale length of   \u00c5. In addition, we show that in the emission line, the luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 galaxies has a faint\u2010end power\u2010law slope of  , a bright\u2010end cutoff of  , and a space density above our detection thresholds of   galaxies Mpc . Finally, by comparing the emission\u2010line and continuum properties of the Ly\u03b1 emitters, we show that the star formation rates derived from Ly\u03b1 are \u223c3 times lower than \u2026",
                "We discuss accurate metallicity measurements for 125 damped Ly\u03b1 (DLA) systems at  , including \u224850 new measurements from our recently published Echellette Spectrograph and Imager surveys. This data set is analyzed to determine the age\u2010metallicity relation of neutral gas in the universe. Contrary to previous analyses, this sample shows statistically significant evolution in the cosmic mean metallicity. The best linear fit for metallicity evolution is \u2212  dex per unit redshift. The DLA systems continue to maintain a floor in metallicity of \u22481\/700 solar, independent of observational effects. This metallicity threshold limits the prevalence of primordial gas in high\u2010redshift galaxies and stresses the correspondence between damped systems and star formation. Finally, we comment on an apparent \u201cmissing metals problem:\u201d the mean metallicity of the damped systems is \u224810 times lower than the value expected from their \u2026",
                "We present UBVRIz  optical images taken with MOSAIC on the CTIO 4 m telescope of the 0.32 deg2 Extended Hubble Deep Field\u2013South. This is one of four fields comprising the MUSYC survey, which is optimized for the study of galaxies at  , active galactic nucleus (AGN) demographics, and Galactic structure. Our methods used for astrometric calibration, weighted image combination, and photometric calibration in AB magnitudes are described. We calculate corrected aperture photometry and its uncertainties and find through tests that these provide a significant improvement upon standard techniques. Our photometric catalog of 62,968 objects is complete to a total magnitude of  , with R\u2010band counts consistent with results from the literature. We select   Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates from their UVR colors and find a sky surface density of 1.4 arcmin\u22122 and an angular correlation function  , consistent with \u2026",
                "We studied the clustering properties and multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of a complete sample of 162 Ly\u03b1\u2010emitting (LAE) galaxies at   discovered in deep narrowband MUSYC imaging of the Extended Chandra Deep Field\u2010South. LAEs were selected to have observed frame equivalent widths >80 \u00c5 and emission line fluxes >  ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121. Only 1% of our LAE sample appears to host AGNs. The LAEs exhibit a moderate spatial correlation length of   Mpc, corresponding to a bias factor  , which implies median dark matter halo masses of   M\u2299. Comparing the number density of LAEs,   Mpc\u22123, with the number density of these halos finds a mean halo occupation \u223c1%\u201310%. The evolution of galaxy bias with redshift implies that most   LAEs evolve into present\u2010day galaxies with  , whereas other   galaxy populations typically evolve into more massive galaxies.

                "The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early 2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design, and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands centered at: 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes and one large-aperture 6-m telescope, with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization.
