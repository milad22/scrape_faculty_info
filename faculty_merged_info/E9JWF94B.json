                "Semiconducting molybdenum disulfphide has emerged as an attractive material for novel nanoscale optoelectronic devices due to its reduced dimensionality and large direct bandgap. Since optoelectronic devices require electron-hole generation\/recombination, it is important to be able to fabricate ambipolar transistors to investigate charge transport both in the conduction band and in the valence band. Although n-type transistor operation for single-layer and few-layer MoS 2 with gold source and drain contacts was recently demonstrated, transport in the valence band has been elusive for solid-state devices. Here we show that a multi-layer MoS 2 channel can be hole-doped by palladium contacts, yielding MoS 2 p-type transistors. When two different materials are used for the source and drain contacts, for example hole-doping Pd and electron-doping Au, the Schottky junctions formed at the MoS 2 contacts \u2026",

His formal background and training is in Electrical Engineering, and he received his Ph.D. from the University of Alberta (Edmonton) in 1993, and was a post-doctoral researcher at Concordia University (Montreal), Simon Fraser University (Vancouver), and the University of California (Berkeley). In 1995, Paranjape held a consulting position for 3 years at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (IRST) in Trento Italy. Paranjape has extensive microfabrication experience having worked at facilities including the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC), the Alberta Microelectronic Centre (AMC), and the standard CMOS-MEMS facility at IRST. Paranjape is an inventor of a unique biomedical technology for sensing human glucose concentrations using a blood-free, pain-free transdermal patch, and holds key intellectual property on the technology. He has served on review panels for the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF Der Wissenschaftsfonds). Paranjape is Associate Editor for Biomedical Microdevices and an editorial board member for Sensors and Materials. Paranjape\u2019s research focuses on the engineering of functional sensors for biomedical applications that are fabricated in the Georgetown Nanoscience and Microtechnology Laboratory (GN\u03bcLab), which uses the same equipment and technologies associated with the production of integrated circuits. Prof. Paranjape has a track-record of involving all levels of undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and even high-school students in many aspects of his research.
