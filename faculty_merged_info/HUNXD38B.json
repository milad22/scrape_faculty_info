                "The authors examine the differential effects of the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital on exploratory and exploitative learning in new product development in new ventures in China. In addition to investigating the potential nonlinear relationships between exploratory and exploitative learning and new product performance, the authors examine the relationship between the interaction of the two types of learning and new product performance. The findings suggest that different dimensions of social capital are indeed significantly related to the level of exploratory and exploitative learning. The results also support the argument that firms need a balance of exploratory and exploitative learning to enhance performance. The findings draw the attention of managers from multinational firms operating in China to the important role of social capital in enhancing new product performance.",
                "Global sourcing strategy has been one of the most hotly debated management trends in the last 20 years. In its early years, global sourcing was examined mostly from \u201cin-house\u201d development and procurement perspectives; and in the last several years, research focus has shifted to \u201coutsourcing\u201d activities. Along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. Although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. Furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy \u2026",
                "Our study focuses on the internal process through which market orientation influences performance in export markets, and develops a model of market orientation\u2013marketing capabilities\u2013competitive advantages\u2013performance relationships. Using survey data of 491 export ventures based in China, we find that marketing capabilities mediate the market orientation\u2013performance relationship, while competitive advantages partially mediate the marketing capabilities\u2013performance relationship. Moreover, coordination mechanism strengthens, and cost leadership strategy weakens, the effects of market orientation on new product development and marketing communication capabilities, respectively. Market turbulence attenuates the effect of market orientation on new product development capability while competitive intensity strengthens this effect.",
                "We integrated the resource-, institution-, and industry-based views to investigate the determinants of export propensity and export intensity, and examined performance outcomes of firms\u2019 export behaviors using the longitudinal data of 18,644 domestic private enterprises and foreign wholly owned subsidiaries in China from 2001 to 2005. We found that institutional environment has significant effects on export behaviors above and beyond the impact of firm competencies and industry factors. Furthermore, firm competencies have differential effects on firms\u2019 export behaviors. Those firms that do not possess distinct firm competencies and those that have cost leadership competencies only do not benefit financially from exporting.",
                "Global procurement of services has been receiving an increasing amount of managerial attention in recent years. Service firms seem to have begun sourcing part of their service activities from abroad in much the same way as manufacturing firms have sourced components and finished goods in the past 30 years. However, little is known about the nature of service sourcing strategy. In this study, we employ a modified transaction\u2013cost analysis to examine empirically the locational (domestic vs. global sourcing) and the ownership (internal vs. external sourcing) aspects of service sourcing strategy. In addition, performance implications on both the locational and ownership aspects of service sourcing are investigated. The results show that, similar to components and finished goods procurement, supplementary services are sourced globally, either internally or externally. Furthermore, the relationship between asset \u2026",
                "In increasingly complex global competition, multinational firms, U.S. and foreign alike, have stepped up international sourcing of components and finished products to serve various markets. Since an increasing portion of global competition is shaped by European and Japanese multinational firms with due emphasis on product quality and manufacturing, it is an opportune time to examine the like among their product development, manufacturing, and sourcing activities. Those European and Japanese multinational firms marketing products in the United States are chosen as subjects of this study.The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a taxonomy of sourcing strategies is developed to systematically identify a variety of sourcing patterns. This taxonomy helps resolve some of the conceptual ambiguities and paves the way for further empirical investigation. Second, based on a few variables identified \u2026",
                "Using a contingency model of global sourcing strategy, this study investigated the moderating effects of sourcing-related factors on the relationship between sourcing strategy and a product's strategic and financial performance. The results lent some support to the contingency model of global sourcing strategy in that product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity were significant moderator variables for financial, but not strategic, performance. However, the results provided no support for bargaining power of suppliers and transaction frequency as moderator variables. In other words, in achieving high financial performance for a product, whether a particular sourcing strategy should be used for a particular product depended on the levels of product innovation, process innovation and asset specificity.",
                "Many firms rely on external sources to acquire knowledge that is critical for enhancing new product market performance. Using a sample of 121 emerging multinational corporations (EMNCs) from China, we explore the effects of managerial ties with government officials and foreign MNC partners on knowledge acquisition and investigate how the acquired knowledge affects firms\u2019 new product market performance. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition could only enhance new product market performance with the presence of realized absorptive capacity. Our study suggests that managers\u2019 decisions on knowledge acquisition from external sources may not increase firms\u2019 new product market performance. Instead, managerial prowess in integrating and transforming knowledge becomes paramount in enhancing new product market performance.",
                "Although foreign multinational firms from the Triad regions increasingly use mainland China as both a sourcing and a marketing location, no study has directly examined the sourcing strategy\u2013performance linkage. Using resource complementarity and resource dependence theory, we extend the sourcing literature and apply these perspectives to an important transitional economy\u2014China. These two theoretical perspectives suggest that product and uncertainty factors moderate the relationship between strategic alliance-based sourcing (SA sourcing) of major components and market performance. We find that, at low levels of product innovativeness and technological uncertainty, the use of SA sourcing is positively related to market performance. However, the effects of product differentiation and demand uncertainty on the sourcing\u2013performance relationship are insignificant.",
                "Comprehensiveness has long been recognized as a key feature of marketing strategy decision making. However, few studies have examined its antecedents and the conditions under which it influences performance. This study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of marketing strategy by investigating project-level antecedents and outcomes of marketing strategy comprehensiveness (MSC). Drawing on contingency and institutional theories perspectives, the authors develop and test the effects of output and process rewards, task conflict, and project members\u2019 intra- and extraindustry relationships on MSC. They find that whereas process reward and extraindustry relationships are positively related to MSC, task conflict (when combined with conflict avoidance) hinders its development. Furthermore, the results indicate that MSC has a more positive effect on performance when implementation speed is \u2026"
