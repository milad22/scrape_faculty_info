                "Photonic technology, using light instead of electrons as the information carrier, is increasingly replacing electronics in communication and information management systems. Microscopic light manipulation, for this purpose, is achievable through photonic bandgap materials 1, 2, a special class of photonic crystals in which three-dimensional, periodic dielectric constant variations controllably prohibit electromagnetic propagation throughout a specified frequency band. This can result in the localization of photons 3, 4, 5, 6, thus providing a mechanism for controlling and inhibiting spontaneous light emission that can be exploited for photonic device fabrication. In fact, carefully engineered line defects could act as waveguides connecting photonic devices in all-optical microchips 7, and infiltration of the photonic material with suitable liquid crystals might produce photonic bandgap structures (and hence light-flow patterns \u2026",
                "Three\u2010dimensional arrays of SiO2 nanometer particles lead to Bragg diffraction effects of visible light\u2014as seen for natural opals, see also this issue's cover\u2014and applications such as photonic bandgap materials. Teh fabrication of the opalline structures is described and details are given of how to obtain ordered compacts. The Figure shows a fracture surface of a sintered sample comprising 390 nm\u2010diameter silica spheres.        ",
                "In this letter, we investigate the optical properties of packed monodisperse silica submicron spheres by means of optical transmission measurements. The results are compatible with a three dimensional face centered cubic order in these solid structures. The lattice parameter of these structures, and therefore their optical properties, can be easily tuned through the sphere size (between 200 and 700 nm) thus covering the whole visible and near infrared spectrum.",
                "Control of the optical properties of SiO2 colloidal photonic crystals through thermal treatment is reported. The optical properties, studied by light transmission and reflection, are shown to vary through structural and physicochemical modification of the material, without loss of order. The Figure is a scanning electron micrograph of the fcc crystalline {111} facet of a sample treated at 950\u00b0C.",
                "It is well-known that stacking of hard spheres results in close-packed structures. However, until recently, it was not clear which of the various possible phases (cubic, hexagonal, mixed, or random) was the stable one. We have performed a microscopy characterization of solid crystals made of monodisperse SiO2 nanometric spheres. It was found that, for a wide range of particle diameters, the cubic phase is the only one present. This largely serves to confirm recent theoretical calculations by L. V. Woodcock which conclude that the cubic phase is the most stable one. This opens new prospects in the application of colloidal crystals to photonic band gap engineering. "
