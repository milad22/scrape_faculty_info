                "What do social workers need to know in order to practise skilfully and effectively? The second edition of this highly respected text gives you the understanding to bridge the gap between social work theory and the challenges of day-to-day practice. Critical Practice in Social Work is different from every other text for several reasons:-Its unique combination of theory, values and practice-The wealth of expertise its contributors bring to their subject-The way the themes of critical practice and reflective practice are used to show how theories can be applied meaningfully-The number of methods covered, in an'easy reference'structure-Its in-depth look at an unrivalled spectrum of professional situations, illustrated by rich case material-Its systematic discussion of professional ethics and values, both as general principles for practice and as practical tools. The book's simultaneous accessibility and depth make it suited for study at both qualifying and post-qualifying level. Conveying the versatility and thoughtfulness required to do social work well, it is an essential purchase for every aspiring and practising social worker's bookshelf. It is one of three interrelated books edited by the internationally renowned and widely published team, Robert Adams, Lena Dominelli and Malcolm Payne. The companion books are Social Work: Themes, Issues and Critical Debates (third edition) and Practising Social Work in a Complex World. Each book can be used alone or in combination with the other two as a uniquely flexible and comprehensive programme of study.",
                "In spite of significant public concern, professional efforts and financial expenditure, there has been a perceived lack of progress in reducing the incidence of child abuse, and in improving the outcomes for children in both the short and longer term. In this article the authors reflect on recent policy developments in the United Kingdom relating to children and families experiencing multiple adversities, and argue that the current conceptualisation of child abuse is flawed. In adopting a rational technical approach to the management of child abuse, there is a tendency to focus on shorter term outcomes for the child, such as immediate safety, that primarily reflect the outputs of the child protection system. However, by viewing child abuse as a wicked problem, that is complex and less amenable to being solved, then child welfare professionals can be supported to focus on achieving longer term outcomes for children that are \u2026",
                "Child welfare professionals regularly make crucial decisions that have a significant impact on children and their families. The present study presents the Judgments and Decision Processes in Context model (JUDPIC) and uses it to examine the relationships between three independent domains: case characteristic (mother's wish with regard to removal), practitioner characteristic (child welfare attitudes), and protective system context (four countries: Israel, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and Spain); and three dependent factors: substantiation of maltreatment, risk assessment, and intervention recommendation. The sample consisted of 828 practitioners from four countries. Participants were presented with a vignette of a case of alleged child maltreatment and were asked to determine whether maltreatment was substantiated, assess risk and recommend an intervention using structured instruments. Participants \u2026",
                "It is estimated that up to one million children may have been exposed to domestic violence in the UK, with significant consequences for their social and emotional development in childhood and later life. At a time when the central and devolved administrations in the UK have developed strategies to tackle domestic violence, this paper reports the findings from a study conducted on children in the child protection system with long\u2010term and complex needs as a result of experiencing domestic violence. The research identifies the characteristics of the children and their families and tracks their careers through the child protection system. The findings indicate that professionals have an awareness of domestic violence, and that younger children with younger parents are most likely to experience prolonged periods in the child protection system. Domestic violence in this context typically co\u2010exists in families experiencing \u2026",
                "\u2022 Summary: Current UK Government policy is concerned with the possible connections between childhood adversity, social exclusion and negative outcomes in adulthood. Understanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences on outcomes in adulthood is therefore key to informing effective policy and practice. In this article, the research on the impact of childhood adversity on outcomes in adulthood is reviewed in the broad categories of: mental health and social functioning; physical health; offending; service use; and economic impact. The literature on resilience that focuses on those who experience adversity, but do not have associated negative outcomes is also briefly considered. The strengths and limitations of the range of research methods used are then examined.\u2022 Findings: Previous studies have tended to focus on specific forms of adversity, predominantly abuse and neglect, and either: specific \u2026",
                "Despite huge investment over the past 10 years, improving outcomes for looked-after children remains elusive. A challenge for practitioners, researchers and policy-makers alike has been the absence of a shared conceptual framework for considering and responding to the needs of looked-after children. A second challenge relates to the measurement of outcomes. In this article the authors reflect on the multiple factors that contribute to outcomes for looked-after children and, drawing upon the work of Cronen and Pearce, propose an organising framework. In as much as it facilitates reflection on the complex interplay between looked-after children and their environments, the ecological perspective outlined in this article holds some promise as an aid to targeting interventions more effectively and efficiently.",
                "Within the United Kingdom there is growing awareness of the need to identify and support the small number of children who are living in families experiencing multiple problems. Research indicates that adverse experiences in childhood can result in poor outcomes in adulthood in terms of lack of employment, poorer physical and mental health and increases in social problems experienced. It is acknowledged that most of these children are known to child welfare professionals and that some are referred to social services, subsequently entering the child protection system. This paper reports research conducted with 28 experienced child welfare professionals. It explores their views about families known to the child protection system with long\u2010term and complex needs in relation to the characteristics of children and their families; the process of intervention with families; and the effects of organisational arrangements \u2026",
                "The use of social work case files as an important research resource is being                 threatened by the increasing regulation of both the research process and access to                 personal identifiable information. While these developments can be seen as a                 reaction to specific incidents of inappropriate research and the misuse of personal                 information, it is argued that the pendulum has swung too far the other way, and in                 seeking to protect the rights of vulnerable individuals, the lives of these same                 individuals may go unstudied with the consequence that they receive less appropriate                 services. Drawing upon the current research of the authors, this article explores                 the difficulties encountered in gaining access to social work case files for                 research purposes without the explicit consent of service users and highlights the                 uncertainty surrounding this \u2026",

                "Although domestic violence is seen as a serious public health issue for women worldwide, international evidence suggests that women aged over 50 who are victims are suffering in silence because the problem is often ignored by health professionals. More UK research is needed to identify the extent of the problem, and services to meet the needs of older women. This study aims to bridge this gap by gaining a deeper understanding of how'older women'cope with domestic violence and how it affects their wellbeing. Eighteen older women who were currently, or had been in an abusive relationship were recruited. Semi-structured interview schedules were used to discuss the personal nature of DV and its effects on wellbeing, ways of coping and sources of support. Findings suggest that living in a domestically violent context has extremely negative effects on older women's wellbeing leading to severe anxiety and \u2026"
