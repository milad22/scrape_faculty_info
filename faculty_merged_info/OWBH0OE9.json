                "Thermal fluctuations induced by increasing temperature can change the state of matter, for example, when water boils to steam. It also is possible to change the state of matter at absolute zero temperature by quantum fluctuations demanded by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. In this case, the quantumphase transition from one state to another is provided by adjusting a tuning parameter other than temperature. A few characteristic examples of quantumphase transitions are reviewed, and their consequences for finite temperature experiments are discussed.",

                "The theory of second-order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed-matter theory. A central concept is the observable order parameter, whose nonzero average value characterizes one or more phases. At large distances and long times, fluctuations of the order parameter(s) are described by a continuum field theory, and these dominate the physics near such phase transitions. We show that near second-order quantum phase transitions, subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm, and we present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets. The critical points separate phases characterized by conventional \u201cconfining\u201d order parameters. Nevertheless, the critical theory contains an emergent gauge field and \u201cdeconfined\u201d degrees of freedom associated with fractionalization of the \u2026",

The quantum-disordered phase is accessed by generalizing to SU (M) symmetry and studying the large M limit.

In addition to disordered states similar to those in unfrustrated systems, phases with incommensurate coplanar spin correlations and unconfined bosonic spinons are found. The occurrence of \u2018\u2018order from disorder\u2019\u2019is discussed. Neither chirally ordered nor spin-nematic states are found.",
                "The large-N limit of a nearest-neighbor SU (N) antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice exhibits in dimensions d\u2265 2 a zero-temperature phase transition between a N\u00e9el ordered state and a resonating-valence-bond state. Here it is shown in d= 1, 2 that topological effects produce spin-Peierls or valence-bond-solid order in the non-N\u00e9el phase with a ground-state degeneracy which varies periodically with \u2018\u2018spin\u2019\u2019for fixed N with periodicity given by the coordination number of the lattice. Thus a non-N\u00e9el phase of the spin-(1\/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice would be a spin-Peierls state with a fourfold degeneracy due to broken lattice rotational symmetry.",
                "The kagome-lattice quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet is studied by a large-N expansion based upon groups with symplectic Sp (N) symmetry. Two distinct types of ground states are found.(i) for large values of the \u2018\u2018spin\u2019\u2019the ground state has long-range magnetic order with the spins ordered in a\u221a 3\u00d7\u221a 3 structure with 9 sites per unit cell. Quantum fluctutions are explicitly shown to select this structure from the large number of classically degenerate states. The only zero-energy excitations about the magnetically ordered state are shown to be the physical, infinite-wavelength, Goldstone spin waves; in contrast the naive semiclassical theory has zero-energy spin waves at all wave vectors.(ii) For small values of the \u2018\u2018spin,\u2019\u2019the ordered moment disappears and we obtain a quantum-disordered ground state with no broken symmetries.

                "We present the critical theory of a number of zero-temperature phase transitions of quantum antiferromagnets and interacting boson systems in two dimensions. The most important example is the transition of the S= 1\u2215 2 square lattice antiferromagnet between the N\u00e9el state (which breaks spin rotation invariance) and the paramagnetic valence bond solid (which preserves spin rotation invariance but breaks lattice symmetries). We show that these two states are separated by a second-order quantum phase transition. This conflicts with Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory, which predicts that such states with distinct broken symmetries are generically separated either by a first-order transition, or by a phase with co-existing orders. The critical theory of the second-order transition is not expressed in terms of the order parameters characterizing either state, but involves fractionalized degrees of freedom and an emergent \u2026",
                "We present the general theory of clean, two-dimensional, quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets which are close to the zero-temperature quantum transition between ground states with and without long-range N\u00e9el order. While some of our discussion is more general, the bulk of our theory will be restricted to antiferromagnets in which the N\u00e9el order is described by a three-vector order parameter.

                "Subir Sachdev Subir Sachdev Herchel Smith Professor of Physics Sachdev's research describes the connection between physical properties of modern quantum materials and the nature of quantum entanglement in the many-particle wavefunction . Sachdev has worked extensively on the description of the diverse varieties of entangled states of quantum matter. These include states with topological order , with and without an energy gap to excitations, and critical states without quasiparticle excitations. Many of these contributions have been linked to experiments, especially to the rich phase diagrams of the high temperature superconductors . Strange metals and black holes Extreme examples of complex quantum entanglement arise in metallic states of matter without quasiparticle excitations, often called strange metals . Remarkably, there is an intimate connection between the quantum physics of strange metals found in modern materials (which can be studied in tabletop experiments), and quantum entanglement near black holes of astrophysics. This connection is most clearly seen by first thinking more carefully about the defining characteristic of a strange metal: the absence of quasiparticles. In practice, given a state of quantum matter, it is difficult to completely rule out the existence of quasiparticles: while one can confirm that certain perturbations do not create single quasiparticle excitations, it is almost impossible to rule out a non-local operator which could create an exotic quasiparticle in which the underlying electrons are non-locally entangled. Sachdev argued ( book , paper ) instead that it is better to examine how rapidly the system loses quantum phase coherence, or reaches local thermal equilibrium in response to general external perturbations. If quasiparticles existed, dephasing would take a long time during which the excited quasiparticles collide with each other. In contrast, states without quasiparticles reach local thermal equilibrium in the fastest possible time, bounded below by a value of order ( Planck constant )\/(( Boltzmann constant ) x ( absolute temperature )). Sachdev proposed a solvable model of a strange metal ( a variant of which is now called the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model), which was shown to saturate such a bound on the time to reach quantum chaos . We can now make the connection to the quantum theory of black holes: quite generally, black holes also thermalize and reach quantum chaos in a time of order ( Planck constant )\/(( Boltzmann constant ) x ( absolute temperature )), where the absolute temperature is the black hole's Hawking temperature . And this similarity to quantum matter without quasiparticles is not a co-incidence: for the SYK models, Sachdev had argued that the strange metal has a holographic dual description in terms of the quantum theory of black holes in a curved spacetime with 1 space dimension. This connection, and other related work by Sachdev and collaborators, have led to valuable insights on the properties of electronic quantum matter, and on the nature of Hawking radiation from black holes. Solvable models of strange metals obtained from the gravitational mapping have inspired analyses of more realistic models of strange metals in the high temperature superconductors and other compounds. Such predictions ( paper 1 , paper 2 ) have been connected to experiments, including some that are in good quantitative agreement with observations on graphene ( paper 1 , paper 2 ). ________________________________ Administrator to the Chair: Jolanta Davis Jefferson 372; Lyman 343 sachdev@g.harvard.edu p: (617) 495-3923 Personal Page Wikipedia Page Condensed Matter Theory Group"
