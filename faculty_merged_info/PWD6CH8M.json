Results are summarised in the form of theorems. Two examples have been taken and streamline patterns are shown for the solutions.",
                "Steady, two dimensional, incompressible electrically conducting, MHD fluid through porous media in a rotating reference frame under the presence of magnetic field which is mutually perpendicular to the velocity field has been considered. Complex variable technique has been employed and exact solutions for three different flow problems have been determined. Lastly, flows with isometric geometry have been studied."
