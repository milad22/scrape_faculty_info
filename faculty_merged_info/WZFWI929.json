PHYS 4C 2 PM to 3:15 PM PHYS 150 4 PM to 5:15 PM PSCI 21 4 PM to 5:15 PM Professor Ringwald's full schedule and contact instructions  Ph.D., Dartmouth College Astronomy research at Fresno State is carried out by Professor Ringwald and his\u00a0students.\n                  It is mainly about cataclysmic variable binary stars and related objects.\u00a0These include\n                  novae, black holes and neutron stars, white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs,\u00a0and the physics\n                  of their accretion disks and outflows. Other research interests include\u00a0common envelope\n                  evolution, stellar magnetism, stellar winds, flare stars, and\u00a0exoplanets. Fresno State\n                  has two observatories. The Campus Observatory, on the\u00a0grounds of the Downing Planetarium,\n                  is where students get hands-on experience with\u00a0astronomical instrumentation. Fresno\n                  State's station at Sierra Remote Observatories,\u00a047 miles from campus at a superb,\n                  dark site in the Sierra Nevada mountains, is\u00a0operated mainly by remote control from\n                  campus over the Internet. Professor Ringwald\u00a0welcomes ideas from students wanting\n                  to do their own research projects, especially if\u00a0they can be carried out with the\n                  equipment we have now. 1.
