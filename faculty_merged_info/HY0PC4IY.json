                "A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb\u2212 1 collected at s= 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb\u2212 1 at s= 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113, H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H\u2192 W W (\u204e)\u2192 e \u03bd \u03bc \u03bd in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e), W W (\u204e), b b\u00af and \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212 in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H\u2192 Z Z (\u204e)\u2192 4 \u2113 and H\u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7\u00d7 10\u2212 9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model \u2026",
                "The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid. This simulation requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions, through packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers. All of these components come together under the ATLAS simulation infrastructure. In this paper, that infrastructure is discussed, including that supporting the detector description, interfacing the event generation, and combining the GEANT4 simulation of the response of the individual detectors. Also described are the tools allowing the software validation, performance testing, and the validation of the simulated output against known physics processes.",
                "We present the results of a search for the top quark in 19.3 pb\u2212 1 of pp collisions at\u221a s= 1.8 TeV. The data were collected at the Fermilab Tevatron collider using the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). The search includes standard model tt decays to final states ee\u03bd\u03bd, e\u03bc\u03bd\u03bd, and \u03bc\u03bc\u03bd\u03bd as well as e+ \u03bd+ jets or \u03bc+ \u03bd+ jets. In the (e, \u03bc)+ \u03bd+ jets channel we search for b quarks from t decays via secondary vertex identification and via semileptonic decays of the b and cascade c quarks. In the dilepton final states we find two events with a background of 0. 56\u2212 0.13+ 0.25 events. In the e, \u03bc+ \u03bd+ jets channel with a b identified via a secondary vertex, we find six events with a background of 2.3\u00b10.3. With a b identified via a semileptonic decay, we find seven events with a background of 3.1\u00b10.3. The secondary vertex and semileptonic-decay samples have three events in common. The probability that the observed yield is consistent \u2026",
                "The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton\u2013proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s\u221a=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb \u22121 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson, for  20\u2264pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |\u03b7|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |\u03b7|<1.2 ) for jets with  55\u2264pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT , the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton\u2013proton collisions and test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |\u03b7|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating \u2026",
                "Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a  or a  boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes , , and . All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb  at  TeV and 20 fb  at  TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.090.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the  decay of  and  standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.",
                "We report the observation of a narrow state decaying into J\/\u03c8 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 and produced in 220 p b\u2212 1 of p \u0304 p collisions at s= 1.96 T e V in the CDF II experiment. We observe 730\u00b190 decays. The mass is measured to be 3871.3\u00b10.7 (s t a t)\u00b10.4 (s y s t) M e V\/c 2, with an observed width consistent with the detector resolution. This is in agreement with the recent observation by the Belle Collaboration of the X (3872) meson.",
                "A measurement of jet activity in the rapidity interval bounded by a dijet system is presented. Events are vetoed if a jet with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV is found between the two boundary jets. The fraction of dijet events that survive the jet veto is presented for boundary jets that are separated by up to six units of rapidity and with mean transverse momentum 50<< 500 GeV. The mean multiplicity of jets above the veto scale in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system is also presented as an alternative method for quantifying perturbative QCD emission. The data are compared to a next-to-leading order plus parton shower prediction from the powheg-box, an all-order resummation using the hej calculation and the pythia, herwig++ and alpgen event generators. The measurement was performed using pp collisions at TeV using data recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2010.",
                "A measurement of the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated prompt photons in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy s= 7 TeV is presented. The measurement covers the pseudorapidity ranges| \u03b7 \u03b3|< 1.37 and 1.52\u2264| \u03b7 \u03b3|< 1.81 in the transverse energy range 15\u2264 E T \u03b3< 100 GeV. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 880 nb\u2212 1, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Photon candidates are identified by combining information from the calorimeters and from the inner tracker. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated from data based on the observed distribution of the transverse isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate. The results are compared to predictions from next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.",
                "Two-particle correlations in relative azimuthal angle (\u0394 \u03d5) and pseudorapidity (\u0394 \u03b7) are measured in s NN= 5.02 TeV p+ Pb collisions using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements are performed using approximately 1 \u03bc b\u2212 1 of data as a function of transverse momentum (p T) and the transverse energy (\u03a3 E T Pb) summed over 3.1< \u03b7< 4.9 in the direction of the Pb beam. The correlation function, constructed from charged particles, exhibits a long-range (2<| \u0394 \u03b7|< 5)\u201cnear-side\u201d(\u0394 \u03d5\u223c 0) correlation that grows rapidly with increasing \u03a3 E T Pb. A long-range \u201caway-side\u201d(\u0394 \u03d5\u223c \u03c0) correlation, obtained by subtracting the expected contributions from recoiling dijets and other sources estimated using events with small \u03a3 E T Pb, is found to match the near-side correlation in magnitude, shape (in \u0394 \u03b7 and \u0394 \u03d5) and \u03a3 E T Pb dependence. The resultant \u0394 \u03d5 correlation is approximately symmetric about \u03c0\/2, and is \u2026",

Using a data sample of 1 fb\u2212 1 of p p collisions at s= 1.96 TeV collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, we find signals of 5600 fully reconstructed hadronic B s decays, 3100 partially reconstructed hadronic B s decays, and 61 500 partially reconstructed semileptonic B s decays. We measure the probability as a function of proper decay time that the B s decays with the same, or opposite, flavor as the flavor at production, and we find a signal for B s 0\u2212 Bs 0 oscillations. The probability that random fluctuations could produce a comparable signal is 8\u00d7 10\u2212 8, which exceeds 5 \u03c3 significance.
