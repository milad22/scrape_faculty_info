Physics, Vassar College (1982) The discovery of the Higgs boson was one of the highlights of my work with the Compact\n                        Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. This discovery\n                        was a long time coming (I started working in CMS in 1994) and was especially memorable\n                        when the CERN announcement of this discovery came on the 4 th of July 2012, which is Independence Day in the US. Now that the Higgs is \u201cold news,\u201d\n                        we are moving into unchartered territories at the high-energy frontier, searching\n                        for something new. Dark matter and dark energy remain enigmas. If dark matter can\n                        be produced in hadron colliders, we will find it.The TTU team and I are hard at work\n                        searching for it in CMS collisions that contain monojets, dijets, monophotons, and\n                        some other exotic topologies. In the last two decades, I have worked on ways of improving energy measurements of\n                        fundamental particles at high energies. I led the R & D, construction, installation,\n                        and commissioning of the CMS forward calorimeters: these calorimeters are fast (Cherenkov\n                        radiation) and radiation-hard (fused-silica optical fibers). They are performing magnificently.\n                        My colleagues at TTU and I have developed a new type of calorimeter (so-called dual-readout)\n                        that takes advantage of the unique features of scintillation and Cherenkov photons\n                        to improve the energy measurements of hadrons. The dual-readout approach is fundamentally\n                        different from conventional techniques and paves the way for precision energy measurement\n                        for all fundamental particles, not just electromagnetically interacting ones. I am\n                        also working on high-granularity silicon calorimeters not only to explore the fine\n                        features of shower shapes but also to extract precision timing information in an attempt\n                        to mitigate large pile-up effects in the high luminosity LHC. We are in the R&D phase\n                        of these new devices and plan to construct a large fraction of CMS's endcap calorimeter\n                        modules at TTU's Advanced Particle Detector Lab (APD Lab) in the coming few years. I enjoy working with undergraduate researchers. In Spring 2017, three groups of undergraduate\n                        students that I mentor presented their research results in conferences: muon tomography\n                        in the \"Archeology Meets Particle Physics\" project, detection of Cherenkov photons in air-showers initiated by very high-energy\n                        gamma rays by the HELADO (High Energy Llano Estacado Detector) group, and radiation\n                        hardness of scintillators for future applications. These are ongoing projects and\n                        interested undergraduates are welcome to contact me. Below you will find some of my publications in the last few years.
