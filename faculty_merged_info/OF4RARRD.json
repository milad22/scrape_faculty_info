                "We consider the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) with varying amounts of nonuniversality in the soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs scalar masses. In addition to the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) in which these are universal with the soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the squark and slepton masses at the input GUT scale, we consider scenarios in which both the Higgs scalar masses are nonuniversal by the same amount (NUHM1), and scenarios in which they are independently nonuniversal (NUHM2). We show how the NUHM1 scenarios generalize the (m 1\/2, m 0) planes of the CMSSM by allowing either \u03bc or m A to take different (fixed) values and we also show how the NUHM1 scenarios are embedded as special cases of the more general NUHM2 scenarios. Generalizing from the CMSSM, we find regions of the NUHM1 parameter space that are \u2026",
                "The apparent discovery of a Higgs boson with mass\u223c 125 GeV has had a significant impact on the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (the CMSSM). Much of the low-mass parameter space in the CMSSM has been excluded by supersymmetric particle searches at the LHC as well as by the Higgs mass measurement and the emergent signal for B s\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212. Here, we consider the impact of these recent LHC results on several variants of the CMSSM with a primary focus on obtaining a Higgs mass of\u223c 125 GeV. In particular, we consider the one-and two-parameter extensions of the CMSSM with one or both of the Higgs masses set independently of the common sfermion mass, m 0 (the NUHM1, 2). We also consider the one-parameter extension of the CMSSM in which the input universality scale M in is below the GUT scale (the sub-GUT CMSSM). Finally, we reconsider mSUGRA \u2026",
                "We consider the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by an early generation of Population III stars coupled with a normal mode of star formation at lower redshift. The computation is performed in the framework of hierarchical structure formation and is based on cosmic star formation histories constrained to reproduce the observed star formation rate at redshift z\u2272 6, the observed chemical abundances in damped Lyman alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium, and to allow for an early reionization of the Universe at z\u223c 11 as indicated by the third year results released by WMAP. We find that the normal mode of star formation produces a gravitational wave background which peaks at 300\u2013500 Hz and is within LIGO III sensitivity. The Population III component peaks at lower frequencies (30\u2013100 Hz depending on the model), and could be detected by LIGO III as well as the planned BBO and \u2026",
                "We consider the possibility that the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters m 1\/2 and m 0 of the MSSM are universal at some scale M in below the supersymmetric grand unification scale M GUT, as might occur in scenarios where either the primordial supersymmetry-breaking mechanism or its communication to the observable sector involve a dynamical scale below M GUT. We analyze the (m 1\/2, m 0) planes of such sub-GUT CMSSM models, noting the dependences of phenomenological, experimental and cosmological constraints on M in. In particular, we find that the coannihilation, focus-point and rapid-annihilation funnel regions of the GUT-scale CMSSM approach and merge when M in\u223c 10 12 GeV. We discuss sparticle spectra and the possible sensitivity of LHC measurements to the value of M in.",
                "We discuss the possibilities for the direct detection of neutralino dark matter via elastic scattering in variants of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) with non-universal supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses, which may be either equal (NUHM1) or independent (NUHM2). We compare the ranges found in the NUHM1 and NUHM2 with that found in the MSSM with universal supersymmetry-breaking contributions to all scalar masses, the CMSSM. We find that both the NUHM1 and NUHM2 offer the possibility of larger spin-independent dark matter scattering cross sections than in the CMSSM for larger neutralino masses, since they allow the density of heavier neutralinos with large Higgsino components to fall within the allowed range by astrophysics. The NUHM1 and NUHM2 also offer more possibilities than the CMSSM for small cross sections for lower neutralino \u2026",
                "We consider two potential non-accelerator signatures of generalizations of the well-studied constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). In one generalization, the universality constraints on soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters are applied at some input scale  below the grand unification (GUT) scale , a scenario referred to as \u2018sub-GUT\u2019. The other generalization we consider is to retain GUT-scale universality for the squark and slepton masses, but to relax universality for the soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the masses of the Higgs doublets. As with other CMSSM-like models, the measured Higgs mass requires supersymmetric particle masses near or beyond the TeV scale. Because of these rather heavy sparticle masses, the embedding of these CMSSM-like models in a minimal SU(5) model of grand unification can yield a proton lifetime consistent with \u2026",
                "We study models in which supersymmetry breaking appears at an intermediate scale, M in, below the GUT scale. We assume that the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the MSSM are universal at M in, and analyze the morphology of the constraints from cosmology and collider experiments on the allowed regions of parameter space as M in is reduced from the GUT scale. We present separate analyses of the (m 1\/2, m 0) planes for tan \u03b2= 10 and tan \u03b2= 50, as well as a discussion of non-zero trilinear couplings, A 0. Specific scenarios where the gaugino and scalar masses appear to be universal below the GUT scale have been found in mirage-mediation models, which we also address here. We demand that the lightest neutralino be the LSP, and that the relic neutralino density not conflict with measurements by WMAP and other observations. At moderate values of M in, we find that the allowed regions of \u2026",
                "We propose boosted dark matter (BDM) as a possible explanation for the excess of keV electron recoil events observed by XENON1T. BDM particles have velocities much larger than those typical of virialized dark matter, and, as such, BDM-electron scattering can naturally produce keV electron recoils. We show that the required BDM-electron scattering cross sections can be easily realized in a simple model with a heavy vector mediator. Though these cross sections are too large for BDM to escape from the Sun, the BDM flux can originate from the Galactic Center or from halo dark matter annihilations. Furthermore, a daily modulation of the BDM signal will be present, which could not only be used to differentiate it from various backgrounds but would also provide important directional information for the BDM flux.",
                "In order for neutralino dark matter to avoid being overproduced in the early Universe, these particles must annihilate (or coannihilate) rather efficiently. Neutralinos with sufficiently large couplings to annihilate at such high a rate (such as those resulting from gaugino-Higgsino mixing, as in \u201cwell-tempered\u201d or \u201cfocus point\u201d scenarios), however, have become increasingly disfavored by the null results of XENON100 and other direct detection experiments. One of the few remaining ways that neutralinos could potentially evade such constraints is if they annihilate through a resonance, as can occur if 2 m \u03c7 0 falls within about\u223c 10% of either m A\/H, m h, or m Z. If no signal is observed from upcoming direct detection experiments, the degree to which such a resonance must be tuned will increase significantly. In this paper, we quantify the degree to which such a resonance must be tuned in order to evade current and \u2026",
                "Recent experimental results from the LHC have placed strong constraints on the masses of colored superpartners. The MSSM parameter space is also constrained by the measurement of the Higgs boson mass, and the requirement that the relic density of lightest neutralinos be consistent with observations. Although large regions of the MSSM parameter space can be excluded by these combined bounds, leptophilic versions of the MSSM can survive these constraints. In this paper we consider a scenario in which the requirements of minimal flavor violation, vanishing C P-violation, and mass universality are relaxed, specifically focusing on scenarios with light sleptons. We find a large region of parameter space, analogous to the original bulk region, for which the lightest neutralino is a thermal relic with an abundance consistent with that of dark matter. We find that these leptophilic models are constrained by \u2026"
