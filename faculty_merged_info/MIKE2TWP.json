His research area is quantum condensed matter theory. Before joining the faculty at Yale University, he was on the faculty of the University of Minnesota. There he was one of the three founding members of the condensed matter group of the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute and later the director of that Institute. Professor Glazman is interested in dynamic properties of quantum low-dimensional interacting systems. These include a diverse set of objects, such as low-dimensional quantum fluids, topological materials, and various condensed matter implementations of qubits. He actively collaborates with the Yale experimental groups in the field of quantum information, and with quantum materials groups outside Yale University.
