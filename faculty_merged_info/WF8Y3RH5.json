                "The identification of stem-cell-like cancer cells through conventional methods that depend on stem cell markers is often unreliable. We developed a mechanical method for selecting tumorigenic cells by culturing single cancer cells in fibrin matrices of~ 100 Pa in stiffness. When cultured within these gels, primary human cancer cells or single cancer cells from mouse or human cancer cell lines grew within a few days into individual round colonies that resembled embryonic stem cell colonies. Subcutaneous or intravenous injection of 10 or 100 fibrin-cultured cells in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency mice led to the formation of solid tumours at the site of injection or at the distant lung organ much more efficiently than control cancer cells selected using conventional surface marker methods or cultured on conventional rigid dishes or on soft gels. Remarkably, as few as ten such cells were able to survive \u2026",
                "A real optimal Fe content: For N and Fe co\u2010doped carbon electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) it is found that there is a real optimal trace Fe content (Peak II), which has never been observed before. The real optimal electrocatalyst shows superior high activity for ORR and possesses the best price\/performance ratio ever.",
                "Both DNA and RNA can serve as powerful building blocks for bottom-up fabrication of nanostructures. A pioneering concept proposed by Ned Seeman 30 years ago has led to an explosion of knowledge in DNA nanotechnology. RNA can be manipulated with simplicity characteristic of DNA, while possessing noncanonical base-pairing, versatile function, and catalytic activity similar to proteins. However, standing in awe of the sensitivity of RNA to RNase degradation has made many scientists flinch away from RNA nanotechnology. Here we report the construction of stable RNA nanoparticles resistant to RNase digestion. The 2\u2032-F (2\u2032-fluoro) RNA retained its property for correct folding in dimer formation, appropriate structure in procapsid binding, and biological activity in gearing the phi29 nanomotor to package viral DNA and producing infectious viral particles. Our results demonstrate that it is practical to produce \u2026",
                "Mast cells are of paramount importance to allergies, pathogen immune responses during infections, and angiogenesis, as well as innate and adaptive immune regulations. Beyond all these roles, mast cells are now more and more being recognized as modulators of tumor microenvironment. Notwithstanding mounting evidences of mast cell accumulation in tumors, their exact role in tumor microenvironment is still incompletely understood. In this review, we discuss the significant role of mast cells in the remodeling of tumor microenvironment by either releasing various factors after activation or interacting with other cells within tumor and, as a result, the possible role of mast cell in cancer invasion and metastasis. We also discuss recent findings that mast cells actively release microparticles, which account for the transfer of membrane-type receptor signal and regulatory molecules such as microRNAs to tumor \u2026",
                "The aim of this study was to identify the best probiotic supplementation in triple therapy for pediatric population with Helicobacter pylori infection.Eligible trials were identified by comprehensive searches. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and relative ranks with P scores were assessed.Twenty-nine trials (3122 participants) involving 17 probiotic regimens were identified. Compared with placebo, probiotic-supplemented triple therapy significantly increased H. pylori eradication rates (relative ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 1.13\u20131.25) and reduced the incidence of total side effects (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.65). Furthermore, to supplemented triple therapy, Lactobacillus casei was identified the best for H. pylori eradication rates (P score = 0.84), and multi-strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus and \u2026",
                "The inflammation-resolving lipid mediator lipoxin A4 (LXA4), which is derived from arachidonic acid in the context of inflammation, can be generated physiologically in vivo. However, the mechanism of physiologic formation of LXA4 remains elusive. In this report, we provide evidence that platelet-derived microparticles contain lipoxygenase 12 (12-LO) protein and act as a mediator in transferring 12-LO to mast cells, leading to the production of LXA4 by mast cells. Absence of either leukotriene, the precursor for LXA4, in mast cells or 12-LO in microparticles abolished LXA4 production. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that platelet-derived microparticles were taken up by peritoneal mast cells in vivo and triggered LXA4 production. We also found that similar to LXA4, platelet-derived microparticles attenuated LPS- or dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation by regulating inflammatory cytokines. Together \u2026",
                "Malignant melanoma (MM) is a major public health problem. The development of effective, systemic therapies for MM is highly desired. We showed here that the transferrin receptor (TfR) was a suitable surface marker for targeting of gene therapy in MM and that the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) was an attractive therapeutic molecular target in MM. We observed that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 blocked cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. We then showed that a transferrin\u2013polyethylenimine\u2013HIF-1\u03b1\u2013short-hairpin RNA (Tf\u2013PEI\u2013HIF-1\u03b1\u2013shRNA) complex could target MM specifically and efficiently both in vivo and in vitro, exploiting the high expression of the TfR in MM. The systemic delivery of sequence-specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) against HIF-1\u03b1 by the Tf\u2013 PEI\u2013HIF-1\u03b1\u2013shRNA complex dramatically inhibited tumor growth in the A375 MM xenograft model. The underlying concept of transfecting a \u2026",
                "Several probiotics were effective in the eradication treatment for Helicobacter pylori (Hp), but their comparative efficacy was unknown.To compare the efficacy of different probiotics when supplemented in Hp eradication therapy.A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all relevant studies in multiple databases and previous meta-analyses. Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to combine direct and indirect evidence and estimate the relative effects.One hundred and forty studies (44 English and 96 Chinese) were identified with a total of 20,215 patients, and more than 10 probiotic strategies were supplemented in Hp eradication therapy. The rates of eradication and adverse events were 84.1 and 14.4% in probiotic group, while 70.5 and 30.1% in the control group. In general, supplementary probiotics were effective in improving the efficacy of Hp eradication and \u2026",
                "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high incidence and mortality worldwide, and its carcinogenesis and progression are influenced by a complex network of gene interactions. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed to identify gene modules associated with the clinical traits in HCC (n= 214). Among the 13 modules, high correlation was only found between the red module and metastasis risk (classified by the HCC metastasis gene signature)(R 2=\u2212 0.74). Moreover, in the red module, 34 network hub genes for metastasis risk were identified, six of which (ABAT, AGXT, ALDH6A1, CYP4A11, DAO and EHHADH) were also hub nodes in the protein-protein interaction network of the module genes. Thus, a total of six hub genes were identified. In validation, all hub genes showed a negative correlation with the four-stage HCC progression (P for trend< 0.05) in the test set. Furthermore, in the training \u2026",
                "The pRNA (packaging RNA) of bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor has been reported to have novel applications in nanotechnology and nanomedicine. The unique ability of pRNA to form dimers, trimers, hexamers and patterned superstructures via the interaction of two reengineered interlocking loops makes it a promising polyvalent vehicle to load siRNA and other therapeutic molecules and be applied as a therapeutic nanoparticle in tumor therapy. In this study, several tumor cell lines were used to evaluate the previously reported pRNA nanotechnology for specific siRNA delivery and for the silencing of targeted gene. It was found that MCF-7 and HeLa cells, out of twenty-five tested tumor cell lines, expressed high levels of folate receptors and exhibited specific binding of the FITC-folate-pRNA nanoparticles, while the others expressed low levels and thus, for these, delivery was not feasible using folate as \u2026"
