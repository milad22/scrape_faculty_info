                "How localized electrons interact with delocalized electrons is a central question to many problems in sold-state physics 1, 2, 3. The simplest manifestation of this situation is the Kondo effect, which occurs when an impurity atom with an unpaired electron is placed in a metal 2. At low temperatures a spin singlet state is formed between the unpaired localized electron and delocalized electrons at the Fermi energy. Theories predict 4, 5, 6, 7 that a Kondo singlet should form in a single-electron transistor (SET), which contains a confined \u2018droplet\u2019of electrons coupled by quantum-mechanical tunnelling to the delocalized electrons in the transistor's leads. If this is so, a SET could provide a means of investigating aspects of the Kondo effect under controlled circumstances that are not accessible in conventional systems: the number of electrons can be changed from odd to even, the difference in energy between the localized \u2026",
                "We demonstrate that the conductance through a single-electron transistor at low temperature is in quantitative agreement with predictions of the equilibrium Anderson model. The Kondo effect is observed when an unpaired electron is localized within the transistor. Tuning the unpaired electron's energy toward the Fermi level in nearby leads produces a crossover between the Kondo and mixed-valence regimes of the Anderson model.",
                "Transport through potential barriers in graphene is investigated using a set of metallic gates capacitively coupled to graphene to modulate the potential landscape. When a gate-induced potential step is steep enough, disorder becomes less important and the resistance across the step is in quantitative agreement with predictions of Klein tunneling of Dirac fermions up to a small correction. We also perform magnetoresistance measurements at low magnetic fields and compare them to recent predictions.",
                "The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junction (n\u2212 p\u2212 n or p\u2212 n\u2212 p) within the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.",
                "This paper provides an overview of research developments toward nanometer-scale electronic switching devices for use in building ultra-densely integrated electronic computers. Specifically, two classes of alternatives to the field-effect transistor are considered: (1) quantum-effect and single-electron solid-state devices and (2) molecular electronic devices. A taxonomy of devices in each class is provided, operational principles are described and compared for the various types of devices, and the literature about each is surveyed. This information is presented in nonmathematical terms intended for a general, technically interested readership.",
                "Besides the usual conductance plateaus at multiples of 2 e 2\/h, quantum point contacts typically show an extra plateau at\u223c 0.7 (2 e 2\/h), believed to arise from electron-electron interactions that prohibit the two spin channels from being simultaneously occupied. We present evidence that the disappearance of the 0.7 structure at very low temperature signals the formation of a Kondo-like correlated spin state. Evidence includes a zero-bias conductance peak that splits in a parallel field, scaling of conductance to a modified Kondo form, and consistency between peak width and the Kondo temperature.",
                "In situ control of spin-orbit coupling in coherent transport using a clean G a A s\/A l G a A s two-dimensional electron gas is realized, leading to a gate-tunable crossover from weak localization to antilocalization. The necessary theory of 2D magnetotransport in the presence of spin-orbit coupling beyond the diffusive approximation is developed and used to analyze experimental data. With this theory the Rashba contribution and linear and cubic Dresselhaus contributions to spin-orbit coupling are separately estimated, allowing the angular dependence of spin-orbit precession to be extracted at various gate voltages.",
                "We have observed asymmetric Fano resonances in the conductance of a single-electron transistor resulting from interference between a resonant and a nonresonant path through the system. The resonant component shows all the features typical of single-electron addition to the confined droplet within the transistor, but the origin of the nonresonant path is unclear. A feature of this experimental system, compared to others that show Fano line shapes, is that changing the voltages on various gates allows one to alter the interference between the two paths.",
                "We perform electrical transport measurements in graphene with several sample geometries. In particular, we design \u201cinvasive\u201d probes crossing the whole graphene sheet as well as \u201cexternal\u201d probes connected through graphene side arms. The four-probe conductance measured between external probes varies linearly with charge density and is symmetric between electron and hole types of carriers. In contrast measurements with invasive probes give a strong electron-hole asymmetry and a sublinear conductance as a function of density. By comparing various geometries and types of contact metal, we show that these two observations are due to transport properties of the metal\/graphene interface. The asymmetry originates from the pinning of the charge density below the metal, which thereby forms a p\u2212 n or p\u2212 p junction, depending on the polarity of the carriers in the bulk graphene sheet. Our results also explain \u2026",
                "When two sheets of graphene are stacked at a small twist angle, the resulting flat superlattice minibands are expected to strongly enhance electron-electron interactions. Here, we present evidence that near three-quarters (34) filling of the conduction miniband, these enhanced interactions drive the twisted bilayer graphene into a ferromagnetic state. In a narrow density range around an apparent insulating state at 34, we observe emergent ferromagnetic hysteresis, with a giant anomalous Hall (AH) effect as large as 10.4 kilohms and indications of chiral edge states. Notably, the magnetization of the sample can be reversed by applying a small direct current. Although the AH resistance is not quantized, and dissipation is present, our measurements suggest that the system may be an incipient Chern insulator."

We know that electrons are charged particles, and hence repel each other; yet in common metals like copper billions of electrons have plenty of room to maneuver and seem to move independently, taking no notice of each other. Professor Goldhaber-Gordon studies how electrons behave when they are instead confined to tiny structures, such as wires only tens of atoms wide. When constrained this way, electrons cannot easily avoid each other, and interactions strongly affect their organization and flow. The Goldhaber-Gordon group uses advanced fabrication techniques to confine electrons to semiconductor nanostructures, to extend our understanding of quantum mechanics to interacting particles, and to provide the basic science that will shape possible designs for future transistors and energy conversion technologies. The Goldhaber-Gordon group makes measurements using cryogenics, precision electrical measurements, and novel scanning probe techniques that allow direct spatial mapping of electron organization and flow. For some of their measurements of exotic quantum states, they cool electrons to a fiftieth of a degree above absolute zero, the world record for electrons in semiconductor nanostructures.

Nature communications He, W. Y., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Law, K. T. 2020 11 (1) : 1650 Recently, quantum anomalous Hall effect with spontaneous ferromagnetism was observed in twisted bilayer graphenes (TBG) near 3\/4 filling. Importantly, it was observed that an extremely small current can switch the direction of the magnetization. This offers the prospect of realizing low energy dissipation magnetic memories. However, the mechanism of the current-driven magnetization switching is poorly understood as the charge currents in graphenes are generally believed to be non-magnetic. In this work, we demonstrate that in TBG, the twisting and substrate induced symmetry breaking allow an out of plane orbital magnetization to be generated by a charge current. Moreover, the large Berry curvatures of the flat bands give the Bloch electrons large orbital magnetic moments so that a small current can generate a large orbital magnetization. We further demonstrate how the charge current can switch the magnetization of the ferromagnetic TBG near 3\/4 filling as observed in the experiments.

W., Putzke, C., Konig, M., Khim, S., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Mackenzie, A. P., Moll, P. J. 2019 10 (1) : 5081 Geometric electron optics may be implemented in solids when electron transport is ballistic on the length scale of a device. Currently, this is realized mainly in 2D materials characterized by circular Fermi surfaces. Here we demonstrate that the nearly perfectly hexagonal Fermi surface of PdCoO2 gives rise to highly directional ballistic transport. We probe this directional ballistic regime in a single crystal of PdCoO2 by use of focused ion beam (FIB) micro-machining, defining crystalline ballistic circuits with features as small as 250nm. The peculiar hexagonal Fermi surface naturally leads to enhanced electron self-focusing effects in a magnetic field compared to circular Fermi surfaces. This super-geometric focusing can be quantitatively predicted for arbitrary device geometry, based on the hexagonal cyclotron orbits appearing in this material. These results suggest a novel class of ballistic electronic devices exploiting the unique transport characteristics of strongly faceted Fermi surfaces. DOI 10.1038\/s41467-019-13020-9 PubMedID 31705049 Signatures of tunable superconductivity in a trilayer graphene moire superlattice. Nature Chen, G., Sharpe, A. L., Gallagher, P., Rosen, I. T., Fox, E. J., Jiang, L., Lyu, B., Li, H., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Jung, J., Shi, Z., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Zhang, Y., Wang, F. 2019 Understanding the mechanism of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity is a central problem in condensed matter physics. It is often speculated that high-Tc superconductivity arises in a doped Mott insulator1 as described by the Hubbard model2-4. An exact solution of the Hubbard model, however, is extremely challenging owing to the strong electron-electron correlation in Mott insulators. Therefore, it is highly desirable to study a tunable Hubbard system, in which systematic investigations of the unconventional superconductivity and its evolution with the Hubbard parameters can deepen our understanding of the Hubbard model. Here we report signatures of tunable superconductivity in an ABC-trilayer graphene (TLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moire superlattice. Unlike in 'magic angle' twisted bilayer graphene, theoretical calculations show that under a vertical displacement field, the ABC-TLG\/hBN heterostructure features an isolated flat valence miniband associated with a Hubbard model on a triangular superlattice5,6 where the bandwidth can be tuned continuously with the vertical displacement field. Upon applying such a displacement field we find experimentally that the ABC-TLG\/hBN superlattice displays Mott insulating states below 20 kelvin at one-quarter and one-half fillings of the states, corresponding to one and two holes per unit cell, respectively. Upon further cooling, signatures of superconductivity ('domes') emerge below 1 kelvin for the electron- and hole-doped sides of the one-quarter-filling Mott state. The electronic behaviour in the ABC-TLG\/hBN superlattice is expected to depend sensitively on the interplay between the electron-electron interaction and the miniband bandwidth. By varying the vertical displacement field, we demonstrate transitions from the candidate superconductor to Mott insulator and metallic phases. Our study shows that ABC-TLG\/hBN heterostructures offer attractive model systems in which to explore rich correlated behaviour emerging in the tunable triangular Hubbard model.

W., Finney, J., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Kastner, M. A., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 2019 When two sheets of graphene are stacked at a small twist angle, the resulting flat superlattice minibands are expected to strongly enhance electron-electron interactions. Here we present evidence that near three-quarters (3\/4) filling of the conduction miniband these enhanced interactions drive the twisted bilayer graphene into a ferromagnetic state. In a narrow density range around an apparent insulating state at 3\/4, we observe emergent ferromagnetic hysteresis, with a giant anomalous Hall (AH) effect as large as 10.4 k\u03a9 and indications of chiral edge states. Surprisingly, the magnetization of the sample can be reversed by applying a small DC current. Although the AH resistance is not quantized and dissipation is significant, our measurements suggest that the system may be an incipient Chern insulator.

F., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 18 (4) : 2603\u20138 Topographic studies using scanning probes have found that graphene surfaces are often covered by micron-scale domains of periodic stripes with a 4 nm pitch. These stripes have been variously interpreted as structural ripples or as self-assembled adsorbates. We show that the stripe domains are optically anisotropic by imaging them using a polarization-contrast technique. Optical spectra between 1.1 and 2.8 eV reveal that the anisotropy in the in-plane dielectric function is predominantly real, reaching 0.6 for an assumed layer thickness of 0.3 nm. The spectra are incompatible with a rippled graphene sheet but would be quantitatively explained by the self-assembly of chainlike organic molecules into nanoscale stripes.

W., Hughes, A., Sharpe, A. L., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 8 Ballistic electrons in solids can have mean free paths far larger than the smallest features patterned by lithography. This has allowed development and study of solid-state electron-optical devices such as beam splitters and quantum point contacts, which have informed our understanding of electron flow and interactions. Recently, high-mobility graphene has emerged as an ideal two-dimensional semimetal that hosts unique chiral electron-optical effects due to its honeycomb crystalline lattice. However, this chiral transport prevents the simple use of electrostatic gates to define electron-optical devices in graphene. Here we present a method of creating highly collimated electron beams in graphene based on collinear pairs of slits, with absorptive sidewalls between the slits. By this method, we achieve beams with angular width 18\u00b0 or narrower, and transmission matching classical ballistic predictions.

J. 8 (1) : 1836 Incorporating ferromagnetic dopants into three-dimensional topological insulator thin films has recently led to the realisation of the quantum anomalous Hall effect. These materials are of great interest since they may support electrical currents that flow without resistance, even at zero magnetic field. To date, the quantum anomalous Hall effect has been investigated using low-frequency transport measurements. However, transport results can be difficult to interpret due to the presence of parallel conductive paths, or because additional non-chiral edge channels may exist. Here we move beyond transport measurements by probing the microwave response of a magnetised disk of Cr-(Bi,Sb)2Te3. We identify features associated with chiral edge plasmons, a signature that robust edge channels are intrinsic to this material system. Our results provide a measure of the velocity of edge excitations without contacting the sample, and pave the way for an on-chip circuit element of practical importance: the zero-field microwave circulator.

I., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 11 (8) : 8395\u20138400 Ionic liquid gating has a number of advantages over solid-state gating, especially for flexible or transparent devices and for applications requiring high carrier densities. However, the large number of charged ions near the channel inevitably results in Coulomb scattering, which limits the carrier mobility in otherwise clean systems. We develop a model for this Coulomb scattering. We validate our model experimentally using ionic liquid gating of graphene across varying thicknesses of hexagonal boron nitride, demonstrating that disorder in the bulk ionic liquid often dominates the scattering. PubMedID 28753312 Robust fractional quantum Hall effect in the N=2 Landau level in bilayer graphene NATURE COMMUNICATIONS Diankov, G., Liang, C., Amet, F., Gallagher, P., Lee, M., Bestwick, A. J., Tharratt, K., Coniglio, W., Jaroszynski, J., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 7 The fractional quantum Hall effect is a canonical example of electron-electron interactions producing new ground states in many-body systems. Most fractional quantum Hall studies have focussed on the lowest Landau level, whose fractional states are successfully explained by the composite fermion model. In the widely studied GaAs-based system, the composite fermion picture is thought to become unstable for the N\u22652 Landau level, where competing many-body phases have been observed. Here we report magneto-resistance measurements of fractional quantum Hall states in the N=2 Landau level (filling factors 4<|\u03bd|<8) in bilayer graphene. In contrast with recent observations of particle-hole asymmetry in the N=0\/N=1 Landau levels of bilayer graphene, the fractional quantum Hall states we observe in the N=2 Landau level obey particle-hole symmetry within the fully symmetry-broken Landau level. Possible alternative ground states other than the composite fermions are discussed.

Y., Diankov, G., Han, Z., Amet, F., Taniguchi, T., Watanabe, K., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Dean, C. R., Shen, Z. 117 (18) We report simultaneous transport and scanning microwave impedance microscopy to examine the correlation between transport quantization and filling of the bulk Landau levels in the quantum Hall regime in gated graphene devices. Surprisingly, a comparison of these measurements reveals that quantized transport typically occurs below the complete filling of bulk Landau levels, when the bulk is still conductive. This result points to a revised understanding of transport quantization when carriers are accumulated by gating. We discuss the implications on transport study of the quantum Hall effect in graphene and related topological states in other two-dimensional electron systems.

R., Gallagher, P., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Fal'ko, V. I., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 353 (6307) : 1526-1529 Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moir\u00e9 pattern in highly aligned graphene\/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high electron mobility and an unusual electronic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of electrons in moir\u00e9 minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse electron focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, electron-electron collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.

We focus on the structure of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate (BMPY-FAP) near the surface of a strontium titanate (SrTiO3) electric double-layer transistor. Using X-ray reflectivity, we show that at positive bias the individual layers in the ionic liquid double layer thicken and the layering persists further away from the interface. We model the reflectivity using a modified distorted crystal model with alternating cation and anion layers, which allows us to extract the charge density and the potential near the surface. We find that the charge density is strongly oscillatory with and without applied potential and that with an applied gate bias of 4.5 V the first two layers become significantly more cation rich than at zero bias, accumulating about 2.5 \u00d7 10(13) cm(-2) excess charge density.

This anisotropy has been thought to originate from periodic nanoscale ripples in the graphene sheet, which enhance puckering around a sliding asperity to a degree determined by the sliding direction. Here we demonstrate that these frictional domains derive not from structural features in the graphene but from self-assembly of environmental adsorbates into a highly regular superlattice of stripes with period 4-6\u2009nm. The stripes and resulting frictional domains appear on monolayer and multilayer graphene on a variety of substrates, as well as on exfoliated flakes of hexagonal boron nitride. We show that the stripe-superlattices can be reproducibly and reversibly manipulated with submicrometre precision using a scanning probe microscope, allowing us to create arbitrary arrangements of frictional domains within a single flake. Our results suggest a revised understanding of the anisotropic friction observed on graphene and bulk graphite in terms of adsorbates.

J., Fox, E. J., Kou, X., Pan, L., Wang, K. L., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 114 (18) We report a nearly ideal quantum anomalous Hall effect in a three-dimensional topological insulator thin film with ferromagnetic doping. Near zero applied magnetic field we measure exact quantization in the Hall resistance to within a part per 10\u2009000 and a longitudinal resistivity under 1\u2009\u2009\u03a9 per square, with chiral edge transport explicitly confirmed by nonlocal measurements. Deviations from this behavior are found to be caused by thermally activated carriers, as indicated by an Arrhenius law temperature dependence. Using the deviations as a thermometer, we demonstrate an unexpected magnetocaloric effect and use it to reach near-perfect quantization by cooling the sample below the dilution refrigerator base temperature in a process approximating adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration.

A., Stanwyck, S. W., Williams, J. R., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 6 Electrolyte gating is a powerful technique for accumulating large carrier densities at a surface. Yet this approach suffers from significant sources of disorder: electrochemical reactions can damage or alter the sample, and the ions of the electrolyte and various dissolved contaminants sit Angstroms from the electron system. Accordingly, electrolyte gating is well suited to studies of superconductivity and other phenomena robust to disorder, but of limited use when reactions or disorder must be avoided. Here we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by protecting the sample with a chemically inert, atomically smooth sheet of hexagonal boron nitride. We illustrate our technique with electrolyte-gated strontium titanate, whose mobility when protected with boron nitride improves more than 10-fold while achieving carrier densities nearing 10(14)\u2009cm(-2). Our technique is portable to other materials, and should enable future studies where high carrier density modulation is required but electrochemical reactions and surface disorder must be minimized.

R., Balicas, L., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 6 : 5838-? The electronic properties of graphene are described by a Dirac Hamiltonian with a four-fold symmetry of spin and valley. This symmetry may yield novel fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states at high magnetic field depending on the relative strength of symmetry-breaking interactions. However, observing such states in transport remains challenging in graphene, as they are easily destroyed by disorder. In this work, we observe in the first two Landau levels the two-flux composite-fermion sequences of FQH states between each integer filling factor. In particular, the odd-numerator fractions appear between filling factors 1 and 2, suggesting a broken-valley symmetry, consistent with our observation of a gap at charge neutrality and zero field. Contrary to our expectations, the evolution of gaps in a parallel magnetic field suggests that states in the first Landau level are not spin-polarized even up to very large out-of-plane fields.

The realization of quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells is considered a milestone in the discovery of topological insulators. Quantum spin Hall states are predicted to allow current flow at the edges of an insulating bulk, as demonstrated in various experiments. A key prediction yet to be experimentally verified is the breakdown of the edge conduction under broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we first establish a systematic framework for the magnetic field dependence of electrostatically gated quantum spin Hall devices. We then study edge conduction of an inverted quantum well device under broken time-reversal symmetry using microwave impedance microscopy, and compare our findings to a non-inverted device. At zero magnetic field, only the inverted device shows clear edge conduction in its local conductivity profile, consistent with theory. Surprisingly, the edge conduction persists up to 9\u2009T with little change. This indicates physics beyond simple quantum spin Hall model, including material-specific properties and possibly many-body effects.

The fate of the low-temperature conductance at the charge-neutrality (Dirac) point in a single sheet of graphene on boron nitride is investigated down to 20\u00a0mK. As the temperature is lowered, the peak resistivity diverges with a power-law behavior and becomes as high as several megohms per square at the lowest temperature, in contrast with the commonly observed saturation of the conductivity. As a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, our device remains insulating and directly transitions to the broken-valley-symmetry, \u03bd=0 quantum Hall state, indicating that the insulating behavior we observe at zero magnetic field is a result of broken valley symmetry. Finally we discuss the possible origins of this effect.

C., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Tokura, Y., Shen, Z. 2019 Quantum-relativistic materials often host electronic phenomena with exotic spatial distributions. In particular, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators feature topological boundary currents whose chirality is determined by the magnetization orientation. However, understanding the microscopic nature of edge vs. bulk currents has remained a challenge due to the emergence of multidomain states at the phase transitions. Here we use microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) to directly image chiral edge currents and phase transitions in a magnetic topological insulator. Our images reveal a dramatic change in the edge state structure and an unexpected microwave response at the topological phase transition between the Chern number [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] states, consistent with the emergence of an insulating [Formula: see text] state. The magnetic transition width is independent of film thickness, but the transition pattern is distinct in differently initiated field sweeps. This behavior suggests that the [Formula: see text] state has 2 surface states with Hall conductivities of [Formula: see text] but with opposite signs.

T., Han, M., Moon, J., Shibayev, P., Jain, D., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Oh, S. 2019 : e1901091 A key feature of the topological surface state under a magnetic field is the presence of the zeroth Landau level at the zero energy. Nonetheless, it is challenging to probe the zeroth Landau level due to large electron-hole puddles smearing its energy landscape. Here, by developing ultra-low-carrier density topological insulator Sb2 Te3 films, an extreme quantum limit of the topological surface state is reached and a hidden phase at the zeroth Landau level is uncovered. First, an unexpected quantum-Hall-to-insulator-transition near the zeroth Landau level is discovered. Then, through a detailed scaling analysis, it is found that this quantum-Hall-to-insulator-transition belongs to a new universality class, implying that the insulating phase discovered here has a fundamentally different origin from those in nontopological systems.

S., Munoz Rojo, M., Bruefach, A., Boone, D., Dowling, K. M., Satterthwaite, P. F., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Pop, E., Senesky, D. G. 2019 In typical thermoelectric energy harvesters and sensors, the Seebeck effect is caused by diffusion of electrons or holes in a temperature gradient. However, the Seebeck effect can also have a phonon drag component, due to momentum exchange between charge carriers and lattice phonons, which is more difficult to quantify. Here, we present the first study of phonon drag in the AlGaN\/GaN two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We find that phonon drag does not contribute significantly to the thermoelectric behavior of devices with 100 nm GaN thickness, which suppresses the phonon mean free path. However, when the thickness is increased to 1.2 mum, up to 32% (88%) of the Seebeck coefficient at 300 K (50 K) can be attributed to the drag component. In turn, the phonon drag enables state-of-the-art thermoelectric power factor in the thicker GaN film, up to 40 mW m-1 K-2 at 50 K. By measuring the thermal conductivity of these AlGaN\/GaN films, we show that the magnitude of the phonon drag can increase even when the thermal conductivity decreases. Decoupling of thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient could enable important advancements in thermoelectric power conversion with devices based on 2DEGs.

C. 17 (7) : 4390\u201399 Resistance switching in TiO2 and many other transition metal oxide resistive random access memory materials is believed to involve the assembly and breaking of interacting oxygen vacancy filaments via the combined effects of field-driven ion migration and local electronic conduction leading to Joule heating. These complex processes are very difficult to study directly in part because the filaments form between metallic electrode layers that block their observation by most characterization techniques. By replacing the top electrode layer in a metal-insulator-metal memory structure with easily removable liquid electrolytes, either an ionic liquid (IL) with high resistance contact or a conductive aqueous electrolyte, we probe field-driven oxygen vacancy redistribution in TiO2 thin films under conditions that either suppress or promote Joule heating. Oxygen isotope exchange experiments indicate that exchange of oxygen ions between TiO2 and the IL is facile at room temperature. Oxygen loss significantly increases the conductivity of the TiO2 films; however, filament formation is not observed after IL gating alone. Replacing the IL with a more conductive aqueous electrolyte contact and biasing does produce electroformed conductive filaments, consistent with a requirement for Joule heating to enhance the vacancy concentration and mobility at specific locations in the film.

R., Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 112 (19) We report on transport measurements of dual-gated, single-layer graphene devices in the quantum Hall regime, allowing for independent control of the filling factors in adjoining regions. Progress in device quality allows us to study scattering between edge states when the fourfold degeneracy of the Landau level is lifted by electron correlations, causing edge states to be spin and\/or valley polarized. In this new regime, we observe a dramatic departure from the equilibration seen in more disordered devices: edge states with opposite spins propagate without mixing. As a result, the degree of equilibration inferred from transport can reveal the spin polarization of the ground state at each filling factor. In particular, the first Landau level is shown to be spin polarized at half filling, providing an independent confirmation of a conclusion of Young et al. [Nat. Phys. 8, 550 (2012). The conductance in the bipolar regime is strongly suppressed, indicating that copropagating edge states, even with the same spin, do not equilibrate along PN interfaces. We attribute this behavior to the formation of an insulating \u03bd = 0 stripe at the PN interface.

However, this new style of cryostat presents challenges for performing scanning probe measurements, mainly as a result of the vibrations introduced by the cryocooler. We demonstrate scanning with root-mean-square vibrations of 0.8 nm at 3 K and 2.1 nm at 15 mK in a 1 kHz bandwidth with our design. Using Coulomb blockade thermometry on a GaAs\/AlGaAs gate-defined quantum dot, we demonstrate an electron temperature of 45 mK.

We observe strong monolayer selectivity for reactions with plasma species, characterized by isotropic hole formation in the basal plane of monolayers and etching from the sheet edges. The areal density of etch pits on monolayers is 2 orders of magnitude higher than on bilayers or thicker sheets. For bilayer or thicker sheets, the etch pit morphology is also quite different: hexagonal etch pits of uniform size, indicating that etching is highly anisotropic and proceeds from pre-existing defects rather than nucleating continuously as on monolayers. The etch rate displays a pronounced dependence on sample temperature for monolayer and multilayer graphene alike: very slow at room temperature, peaking at 400 \u00b0C and suppressed entirely at 700 \u00b0C. Applying the same hydrogen plasma treatment to graphene deposited on the much smoother substrate mica leads to very similar phenomenology as on the rougher SiO\u2082, suggesting that a factor other than substrate roughness controls the reactivity of monolayer graphene with hydrogen plasma species.

B., Hosseini, A., Sulpizio, J. A., Chidsey, C. E., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 6 (11) : 9920-9931 We present a method to fabricate individually addressable junctions of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that builds on previous studies which have shown that soft conductive polymer top contacts virtually eliminate shorts through the SAMs. We demonstrate devices with nanoscale lateral dimensions, representing an order of magnitude reduction in device area, with high yield and relatively low device-to-device variation, improving several features of previous soft contact devices. The devices are formed in pores in an inorganic dielectric layer with features defined by e-beam lithography and dry etching. We replace the aqueous PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer used in prior devices with Aedotron P, a low-viscosity, amphiphilic polymer, allowing incorporation of self-assembled monolayers with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic termination with the same junction geometry and materials. We demonstrate the adaptability of this new design by presenting transport measurements on SAMs composed of alkanethiols with methyl, thiol, carboxyl, and azide terminations. We establish that the observed room-temperature tunnel barrier is primarily a function of monolayer thickness, independent of the terminal group's hydrophilicity. Finally, we investigate the temperature dependence of transport and show that the low-temperature behavior is based on the energy distribution of sites from which carriers can tunnel between the polymer and gold contacts, as described by a model of variable-range hopping transport in a disordered conductor.

A recipe that successfully removes organic contaminants and results in clean h-BN flakes involves treatment in Ar\/O(2) at 500 \u00b0C.

A saturating resistance upturn and negative magnetoresistance that signal the emergence of the Kondo effect appear for higher applied gate voltages. This observation, enabled by the wide tunability of the ionic gel-applied electric field, promotes the interpretation of the electric field-effect-induced 2D electron system in SrTiO(3) as an admixture of magnetic Ti(3+) ions, i.e., localized and unpaired electrons, and delocalized electrons that partially fill the Ti 3d conduction band.

A., Diankov, G., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Wong, H. S. 82 (5) We have developed a highly sensitive integrated capacitance bridge for quantum capacitance measurements. Our bridge, based on a GaAs HEMT amplifier, delivers attofarad (aF) resolution using a small AC excitation at or below k(B)T over a broad temperature range (4-300 K). We have achieved a resolution at room temperature of 60\u2002aF\/\u221aHz for a 10\u2009\u2009mV ac excitation at 17.5 kHz, with an improved resolution at cryogenic temperatures, for the same excitation amplitude. We demonstrate the utility of our bridge for measuring the quantum capacitance of nanostructures by measuring the capacitance of top-gated graphene devices and cleanly resolving the density of states.

M., Stander, N., Stoltenberg, R. M., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Bao, Z. 4 (11) : 6409-6416 This study evaluates an alternative to electron-beam lithography for fabricating nanoscale graphene devices. Dip-pen nanolithography is used for defining monolayer graphene flakes and for patterning of gold electrodes through writing of an alkylthiol on thin films of gold evaporated onto graphene flakes. A wet gold etching step was used to form the individual devices. The sheet resistances of these monolayer graphene devices are comparable to reported literature values. This alternative technique for making electrical contact to 2D nanostructures provides a platform for fundamental studies of nanomaterial properties. The merits of using dip-pen nanolithography include lack of electron-beam irradiation damage and targeted patterning of individual devices with imaging and writing conducted in the same instrument under ambient conditions.

J., Williams, J. R., Kong, D., Meister, S., Peng, H., Bestwick, A. J., Gallagher, P., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Cui, Y. 10 (3) : 1076-1081 A simple surface band structure and a large bulk band gap have allowed Bi2Se3 to become a reference material for the newly discovered three-dimensional topological insulators, which exhibit topologically protected conducting surface states that reside inside the bulk band gap. Studying topological insulators such as Bi2Se3 in nanostructures is advantageous because of the high surface-to-volume ratio, which enhances effects from the surface states; recently reported Aharonov-Bohm oscillation in topological insulator nanoribbons by some of us is a good example. Theoretically, introducing magnetic impurities in topological insulators is predicted to open a small gap in the surface states by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Here, we present synthesis of magnetically doped Bi2Se3 nanoribbons by vapor-liquid-solid growth using magnetic metal thin films as catalysts. Although the doping concentration is less than approximately 2%, low-temperature transport measurements of the Fe-doped Bi2Se3 nanoribbon devices show a clear Kondo effect at temperatures below 30 K, confirming the presence of magnetic impurities in the Bi2Se3 nanoribbons. The capability to dope topological insulator nanostructures magnetically opens up exciting opportunities for spintronics.

S., Gruner, G. 9 (5) : 1866-1871 Carbon nanotube network field effect transistors (CNTN-FETs) are promising candidates for low cost macroelectronics. We investigate the microscopic transport in these devices using electric force microscopy and simulations. We find that in many CNTN-FETs the voltage drops abruptly at a point in the channel where the current is constricted to just one tube. We also model the effect of varying the semiconducting\/metallic tube ratio. The effect of Schottky barriers on both conductance within semiconducting tubes and conductance between semiconducting and metallic tubes results in three possible types of CNTN-FETs with fundamentally different gating mechanisms. We describe this with an electronic phase diagram.

We find that the low-energy Kondo conductance is consistent with universality between temperature and bias and is characterized by a quadratic scaling exponent, as expected for the spin-1\/2 Kondo effect. We show that the nonequilibrium Kondo transport measurements are well described by a universal scaling function with two scaling parameters.

A., Stander, N., Todd, K., Yang, B., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 98 (23) The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junction (n-p-n or p-n-p) within the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.

Screening due to mobile charges in the QPC is measured quantitatively, using a second point contact. These measurements are performed from pinch-off through the opening of the first few modes in the QPC. While the measured signal closely matches a Thomas-Fermi-Poisson prediction, deviations from the classical behavior are apparent near the openings of the different modes. Density functional calculations attribute the deviations to a combination of a diverging density of states at the opening of each one-dimensional mode and exchange interaction, which is strongest for the first mode.

G., Shtrikman, H., Oreg, Y., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 446 (7132) : 167-171 Some of the most intriguing problems in solid-state physics arise when the motion of one electron dramatically affects the motion of surrounding electrons. Traditionally, such highly correlated electron systems have been studied mainly in materials with complex transition metal chemistry. Over the past decade, researchers have learned to confine one or a few electrons within a nanometre-scale semiconductor 'artificial atom', and to understand and control this simple system in detail(3). Here we combine artificial atoms to create a highly correlated electron system within a nano-engineered semiconductor structure. We tune the system in situ through a quantum phase transition between two distinct states, each a version of the Kondo state, in which a bound electron interacts with surrounding mobile electrons. The boundary between these competing Kondo states is a quantum critical point-namely, the exotic and previously elusive two-channel Kondo state, in which electrons in two reservoirs are entangled through their interaction with a single localized spin.

T., Ku, K. C., Xiang, G., Crooker, S. A., Samarth, N., Goldhaber-Gordon, D. 96 (19) We measure the low-field Hall resistivity of a magnetically doped two-dimensional electron gas as a function of temperature and electrically gated carrier density. Comparing these results with the carrier density extracted from Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals an excess Hall resistivity that increases with decreasing temperature. This excess Hall resistivity qualitatively tracks the paramagnetic polarization of the sample, in analogy to the ferromagnetic anomalous Hall effect. The data are consistent with skew scattering of carriers by disorder near the crossover to localization.

MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY. : 165\u2013176 Web of Science ID 000230926900025 Measurements of Kondo and spin splitting in single-electron transistors Kogan, A., Amasha, S., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Granger, G., Kastner, M. A., Shtrikman, H. 93 (16) We measure the spin splitting in a magnetic field B of localized states in single-electron transistors using a new method, inelastic spin-flip cotunneling. Because it involves only internal excitations, this technique gives the most precise value of the Zeeman energy Delta=\/g\/mu(B)B. In the same devices we also measure the splitting with B of the Kondo peak in differential conductance. The Kondo splitting appears only above a threshold field as predicted by theory. However, the magnitude of the Kondo splitting at high fields exceeds 2\/g\/mu(B)B in disagreement with theory.

Stabilization of the two-channel Kondo fixed point requires fine control of the electrochemical potential in each droplet, which can be achieved by adjusting voltages on nearby gate electrodes. We study the conditions for obtaining this type of two-channel Kondo behavior, discuss the experimentally observable consequences, and explore the generalization to the multichannel Kondo case.

B., Zumbuhl, D. M., Marcus, C. M., Lyanda-Geller, Y. B., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Campman, K., Gossard, A. C. 90 (7) In situ control of spin-orbit coupling in coherent transport using a clean GaAs\/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas is realized, leading to a gate-tunable crossover from weak localization to antilocalization. The necessary theory of 2D magnetotransport in the presence of spin-orbit coupling beyond the diffusive approximation is developed and used to analyze experimental data. With this theory the Rashba contribution and linear and cubic Dresselhaus contributions to spin-orbit coupling are separately estimated, allowing the angular dependence of spin-orbit precession to be extracted at various gate voltages.

M., Lynch, H. J., Goldhaber-Gordon, D., Kouwenhoven, L. P., Marcus, C. M., Hirose, K., Wingreen, N. S., Umansky, V. 88 (22) Besides the usual conductance plateaus at multiples of 2e(2)\/h, quantum point contacts typically show an extra plateau at approximately 0.7(2e(2)\/h), believed to arise from electron-electron interactions that prohibit the two spin channels from being simultaneously occupied. We present evidence that the disappearance of the 0.7 structure at very low temperature signals the formation of a Kondo-like correlated spin state. Evidence includes a zero-bias conductance peak that splits in a parallel field, scaling of conductance to a modified Kondo form, and consistency between peak width and the Kondo temperature.

Semiconductor nanostructures, superconductivity and low-temperature physics, atomic and molecular measurement and control, novel quantum materials. News: Stanford researchers create exotic electrons that may lead to new materials, devices Research in experimental condensed matter physics at Stanford takes place in the Physics and Applied Physics Departments and has strong connections with the Photon Science Department at the National Accelerator Laboratory. A broad set of topics are explored in the Varian Physics Laboratory, Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials and through the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Science A large community of physicists at Stanford address questions in condensed matter physics and materials science.\u00a0 How do electrons organize themselves and flow on the nanoscale? This is addressed with nanofabrication, materials growth, precision low-temperature electrical measurements, and novel scanning probe techniques. Other efforts address emerging phases and quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems, highlighting time-reversal and inversion symmetry breaking, charge and spin ordering and their competition with magnetism and superconductivity. Condensed-matter techniques are used for precision measurements of fundamental physics such as Newton's gravity at sub-mm length scales. Other research addresses emerging phenomena in quantum solids: high-temperature superconductivity, excitations in low-dimensional compounds, quantum-phase transitions, novel spin-orbit physics, heavy fermions, charge-density waves, magnetoresistive materials, metal-insulator transitions, organic conductors and superconductors.\u00a0 These experiments rely on various forms of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy: spatial, spin and time-resolved, inelastic x-ray scattering, and soft x-ray emmision spectroscopy. Efforts at the intersection of condensed matter physics and nanoscale science and technology use scanning probe instruments to do quantum imaging and manipulation of matter on length scales now approaching the femtometer; work is this area addresses single atoms, molecules, electrons, spins, vibrons, and quantum phases.
