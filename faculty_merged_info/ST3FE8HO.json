                "Bile acids regulate the transcription of genes that control cholesterol homeostasis through molecular mechanisms that are poorly understood. Physiological concentrations of free and conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid activated the farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), an orphan nuclear receptor. As ligands, these bile acids and their conjugates modulated interaction of FXR with a peptide derived from steroid receptor coactivator 1. These results provide evidence for a nuclear bile acid signaling pathway that may regulate cholesterol homeostasis.",
                "We explored the effects of bile acids on triglyceride (TG) homeostasis using a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal models. Cholic acid (CA) prevents hepatic TG accumulation, VLDL secretion, and elevated serum TG in mouse models of hypertriglyceridemia. At the molecular level, CA decreases hepatic expression of SREBP-1c and its lipogenic target genes. Through the use of mouse mutants for the short heterodimer partner (SHP) and liver X receptor (LXR) \u03b1 and \u03b2, we demonstrate the critical dependence of the reduction of SREBP-1c expression by either natural or synthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists on both SHP and LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2. These results suggest that strategies aimed at increasing FXR activity and the repressive effects of SHP should be explored to correct hypertriglyceridemia.",

                "The Charon lambda bacteriophages have been developed as vectors for cloning. Their construction incorporates mutations that make them simple to use and also greatly increases their safety for the biological containment of cloned recombinant DNA. Three of the Charon vector phages, 3A, 4A, and 16A, have been certified for use as EK2 vector-host systems, when propagated in bulk in a special bacterial host, DP50SupF. We present here some of the data on which the safety of these systems was evaluated. DNA fragments ranging in size from 0 to 2.2 X 10(4) base pairs can be cloned in these EK2 Charon phages.",
                "Liver cancer has the second highest worldwide cancer mortality rate and has limited therapeutic options. We analyzed 363 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases by whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses, and we analyzed 196 HCC cases by DNA methylation, RNA, miRNA, and proteomic expression also. DNA sequencing and mutation analysis identified significantly mutated genes, including LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4. Significant alterations by mutation or downregulation by hypermethylation in genes likely to result in HCC metabolic reprogramming (ALB, APOB, and CPS1) were observed. Integrative molecular HCC subtyping incorporating unsupervised clustering of five data platforms identified three subtypes, one of which was associated with poorer prognosis in three HCC cohorts. Integrated analyses enabled development of a p53 target gene expression signature \u2026",
                "The human growth hormone (hGH) transient assay system described here is based on the expression of hGH directed by cells transfected with hGH fusion genes. Levels of secreted hGH in the medium, measured by a simple radioimmunoassay, are proportional to both levels of cytoplasmic hGH mRNA and the amount of transfected DNA. The system is extremely sensitive, easy to perform, and is qualitatively different from other transient expression systems in that the medium is assayed and the cells themselves are not destroyed. The hGH transient assay system is appropriate for analyses of regulation of gene expression and was utilized here to investigate the effect of the simian virus 40 enhancer on the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and the effect of zinc on the mouse metallothionein-I promoter. The expression of hGH can also be used as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency \u2026",
                "The bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) is a central regulator of bile acid and lipid metabolism. We show here that FXR plays a key regulatory role in glucose homeostasis. FXR-null mice developed severe fatty liver and elevated circulating FFAs, which was associated with elevated serum glucose and impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Their insulin resistance was confirmed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, which showed attenuated inhibition of hepatic glucose production by insulin and reduced peripheral glucose disposal. In FXR\u2013\/\u2013skeletal muscle and liver, multiple steps in the insulin signaling pathway were markedly blunted. In skeletal muscle, which does not express FXR, triglyceride and FFA levels were increased, and we propose that their inhibitory effects account for insulin resistance in that tissue. In contrast to the results in FXR\u2013\/\u2013mice, bile acid activation of FXR in WT \u2026",
                "Organisms encounter a wide range of foreign compounds\u2014or \u2018xenobiotics\u2019\u2014with potentially harmful consequences. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize xenobiotics and thus are a primary defence against these compounds. Increased expression of specific CYP genes in response to particular xenobiotics is a central component of this defence 1, although such induction can also increase production of toxic metabolites. Here we show that the nuclear receptor CAR mediates the response evoked by a class of xenobiotics known as the \u2018phenobarbital-like inducers\u2019. The strong activation of Cyp2b10 gene expression by phenobarbital, or by the more potent TCPOBOP, is absent in mice lacking the CAR gene. These animals also show decreased metabolism of the classic CYP substrate zoxazolamine and a complete loss of the liver hypertrophic and hyperplastic responses to these inducers. Cocaine \u2026",
                "Liver mass depends on one or more unidentified humoral signals that drive regeneration when liver functional capacity is diminished. Bile acids are important liver products, and their levels are tightly regulated. Here, we identify a role for nuclear receptor\u2013dependent bile acid signaling in normal liver regeneration. Elevated bile acid levels accelerate regeneration, and decreased levels inhibit liver regrowth, as does the absence of the primary nuclear bile acid receptor FXR. We propose that FXR activation by increased bile acid flux is a signal of decreased functional capacity of the liver. FXR, and possibly other nuclear receptors, may promote homeostasis not only by regulating expression of appropriate metabolic target genes but also by driving homeotrophic liver growth."
