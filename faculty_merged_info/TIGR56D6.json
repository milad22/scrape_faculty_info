Rothstein Professor of Physics Nuclear & Particle Physics High Energy Physics Theory Wean Hall 7406 412-268-2739 Ph.D.: University of Maryland (1992) M.Sc.: Brown University (1987) Professional Societies: Fellow, American Physical Society Professor of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University, 2003\u2013 Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 2000\u201303 Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, 1997\u20132000 Post-doctoral Research: UC San Diego, 1995\u201397 Post-doctoral Research: University of Michigan, 1992\u201395 I am interested in diverse topics in elementary particle physics, gravity wave physics, astrophysics\/cosmology and QCD. In the realm of high energy physics, I am concerned with using the data from the LHC to explain the origin of mass and the nature of the dark matter. I have worked on various topics in this field ranging from theories of extra dimensions to calculating Higgs boson production rates. Recently, I have spent much of my time working on using ideas developed in quantum field theory to calculate classical gravity wave profiles for inspiralling black holes. Using these techniques, we have been able to calculate the effects of black hole spin on the predicted wave forms which are being measured at the LIGO experiment. I have also been working on effective field theory techniques to find systematic ways of calculating strong interaction observables at high energies. Recent Publications I.Z. Rothstein, P.
