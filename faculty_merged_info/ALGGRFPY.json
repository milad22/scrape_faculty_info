                "Welcome to the Li Lab Department of Physics at Brown University Research Members Facility Photos Opportunity Research Members Facility Photos Opportunity The low dimensional electronics lab The Li lab uses 2D materials to assemble the so-called van der Waals heterostructure, where novel quantum states of matter could be stabilized and engineered by controlling the stacking sequence and relative rotation between different building blocks.\u00a0 The combination of van der Waals assembly technique and 2D materials provides a paradigm platform to address a wide range of fundamental open questions in condensed matter physics and make new discoveries related to future materials. We utilize a range of experimental techniques to probe the nature of electron correlation in atomic layer thin devices. Apart from conventional charge transport, we are developing measurement and analysis schemes necessary for measuring heat flow, spin resonance and acoustic wave propagation in 2D materials.
