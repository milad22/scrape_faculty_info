                "The phonon is the physical particle representing mechanical vibration and is responsible for the transmission of everyday sound and heat. Understanding and controlling the phononic properties of materials provides opportunities to thermally insulate buildings, reduce environmental noise, transform waste heat into electricity and develop earthquake protection. Here I review recent progress and the development of new ideas and devices that make use of phononic properties to control both sound and heat. Advances in sonic and thermal diodes, optomechanical crystals, acoustic and thermal cloaking, hypersonic phononic crystals, thermoelectrics, and thermocrystals herald the next technological revolution in phononics.",
                "In this Letter we propose the use of hypersonic phononic crystals to control the emission and propagation of high frequency phonons. We report the fabrication of high quality, single crystalline hypersonic crystals using interference lithography and show that direct measurement of their phononic band structure is possible with Brillouin light scattering. Numerical calculations are employed to explain the nature of the observed propagation modes. This work lays the foundation for experimental studies of hypersonic crystals and, more generally, phonon-dependent processes in nanostructures.",
                "Certain periodic dielectric structures can prohibit the propagation of light for all directions within a frequency range. These'photonic crystals' allow researchers to modify the interaction between electromagnetic fields and dielectric media from radio to optical wavelengths. Their technological potential, such as the inhibition of spontaneous emission, enhancement of semiconductor lasers, and integration and miniaturization of optical components, makes the search for an easy-to-craft photonic crystal with a large bandgap a major field of study. This progress article surveys a collection of robust complete three-dimensional dielectric photonic-bandgap structures for the visible and near-infrared regimes based on the diamond morphology together with their specific fabrication techniques. The basic origin of the complete photonic bandgap for the'champion'diamond morphology is described in terms of dielectric \u2026",
                "Three\u2010dimensional photonic crystals are fabricated from block copolymers, forming a double gyroid network structure. Further processing produces three\u2010dimensionally nanoporous, freestanding materials (see Figure), and allows dielectric enhancement and infiltration, which dramatically improve optical and material properties. These etched materials provide a path to highly effective photonic crystals via self\u2010assembly.",
                "By transforming heat flux from particle to wave phonon transport, we introduce a new class of engineered material to control thermal conduction. We show that rationally designed nanostructured alloys can lead to a fundamental new approach for thermal management, guiding heat as photonic and phononic crystals guide light and sound, respectively. Novel applications for these materials include heat waveguides, thermal lattices, heat imaging, thermo-optics, thermal diodes, and thermal cloaking.",
                "We show how to fabricate three basic photonic crystal structures with simple cubic, fcc, and bcc translational symmetry by interference lithography. The structures are fabricable by the interference of beams launched from the same half space. The simple cubic structure is size scalable while the structure with fcc translational symmetry possesses two band gaps. Both these structures are experimentally realized.",
                "Interference lithography (IL) holds the promise of fabricating large\u2010area, defect\u2010free 3D structures on the submicrometer scale both rapidly and cheaply. A stationary spatial variation of intensity is created by the interference of two or more beams of light. The pattern that emerges out of the intensity distribution is transferred to a light sensitive medium, such as a photoresist, and after development yields a 3D bicontinuous photoresist\/air structure. Importantly, by a proper choice of beam parameters one can control the geometrical elements and volume fraction of the structures. This article provides an overview of the fabrication of 3D structures via IL (e.g., the formation of interference patterns, their dependence on beam parameters and several requirements for the photoresist) and highlights some of our recent efforts in the applications of these 3D structures in photonic crystals, phononic crystals and as microframes \u2026",
                "We demonstrate theoretically the simultaneous localization of photons and phonons in the same spatial region by introducing lattice defects in a periodic array of dielectric\/elastic material that exhibits gaps for both electromagnetic and elastic waves. Transverse electromagnetic waves, pure shear elastic waves, and mixed shear and dilatation elastic waves were simultaneously localized. The coexistent localization of light and sound can have a strong influence on photon-phonon interactions (i.e., optical cooling) and the possibility of dual acoustic-optical devices that can integrate the management of sound, heat, and light.",
                "Written by the department head of materials science and engineering at MIT, this concise and stringent introduction takes readers from the fundamental theory to in-depth knowledge. It sets out with a theoretical scheme for the design of desirable periodic structures, then presents the experimental techniques that allow for fabrication of the periodic structure and exemplary experimental data. Subsequently, theory and numerical data are used to demonstrate how these periodic structures control the photonic, acoustic, and mechanical properties of materials, concluding with examples from these three important fields of applications. The result is must-have knowledge for both beginners and veterans in the field.",
                "The engineering of optical and acoustic material functionalities via construction of ordered local and global architectures on various length scales commensurate with and well below the characteristic length scales of photons and phonons in the material is an indispensable and powerful means to develop novel materials. In the current mature status of photonics, polymers hold a pivotal role in various application areas such as light\u2010emission, sensing, energy, and displays, with exclusive advantages despite their relatively low dielectric constants. Moreover, in the nascent field of phononics, polymers are expected to be a superior material platform due to the ability for readily fabricated complex polymer structures possessing a wide range of mechanical behaviors, complete phononic bandgaps, and resonant architectures. In this review, polymer\u2010centric photonic and phononic crystals and metamaterials are \u2026"
