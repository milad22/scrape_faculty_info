                "Jay Christopher Howk Jay Christopher Howk Professor B.A., Hanover College, 1994 Ph.D., University of Wisconsin, 1999 E-mail: jhowk@nd.edu Address: 339b Phone: (574) 631-8594 Fax: (574) 631-5952 Prof. Howk\u2019s research is focused on understanding the evolution of the gaseous components of galaxies and the build up of the elements since the Big Bang. The history of star formation in a galaxy is in large part dictated by its gas content.\u00a0Star formation consumes some of this gas, but it may also energize and eject more from the galaxy.\u00a0At the same time, the infall of new matter from the intergalactic medium\u2014matter that may be largely unpolluted with metals since the Big Bang\u2014fuels additional star formation.\u00a0Howk\u2019s research probes this exchange of matter between galaxies and their surroundings and tries to assess the impact recently formed stars have on the gas within galaxies. Using observations from the Large Binocular Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, and others, Howk\u2019s group is attempting to piece together the story of how galaxies acquire their gas and eject some gas and newly-created metals into the intergalactic medium.\u00a0This requires using spectroscopy to identify the gas near galaxies and spectroscopy and imaging to study the galaxies themselves.\u00a0While much of the work in this process is focused on the properties of the gas, understanding the galaxies and the way in which they work drives the research of Howk and his group. \"The detection of interstellar lithium in the low-metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud,\" Howk, J.C., Lehner, N., Fields, B.D., & Mathews, G.J., Nature, 489, 121-123 (2012) \u201cEvidence for Cold Accretion: Primitive Gas Flowing onto a Galaxy at z~0.274,\u201d Ribaudo, J., Lehner, N., Howk, J.C., Werk, J.K., Tripp, T.M., Prochaska, J.X., Meiring, J.D., and Tumlinson, J., Astrophysical Journal, 743, 207 [7pp] (2011) \u201cA Reservoir of Ionized Gas in the Galactic Halo to Sustain Star Formation in the Milky Way,\u201d Lehner, N., and Howk, J.C., Science, 334, 955-958 (2011) \u201cThe Hidden Mass and Large Spatial Extent of a Post-Starburst Galaxy Outflow,\u201d Tripp, T.M., Meiring, J.D., Prochaska, J.X., Willmer, C.N.A., Howk, J.C., Werk, J.K., Jenkins, E.B., Bowen, D.V., Lehner, N., Sembach, K.R., Thom, C., and Tumlinson, J.
