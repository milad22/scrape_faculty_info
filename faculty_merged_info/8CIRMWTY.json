                "Cristiano  Galbiati Cristiano  Galbiati Professor of Physics 609-258-1245 galbiati@Princeton.EDU Susan  Sabatura 364 Jadwin physics.princeton.edu\/~galbiati\/ On the latest episode of the \u201cWe Roar\u201d podcast, listen to particle physicist Cristian Galbiati tell the extraordinary story of how his lockdown inspiration \u2013 if I can use compressed argon to find dark matter, I bet I can find a way to push compressed oxygen and nitrogen into human lungs \u2013 became one of the most rapid success stories in FDA history.  Working with a team of more than 200 experts, including doctors, engineers and fellow dark matter physicists, the Mechanical Ventilator Milano went from concept to FDA approval in just 42 days, and it is now in full production. The ventilators are designed specifically for COVID-19 patients and can be assembled from off-the-shelf components. The full version now in production runs between $5,000 and 6,000 making the MVM many times less expensive than other ventilators on the market. Listen to the podcast My interests lie at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Dark matter: Recent observations from WMAP have demonstrated that a large fraction of the energy in the Universe - 25% - is in the form of cold matter that does not clump and does not shine light.\u00a0 This dark matter is one of the fundamental constituents of the Universe and, to date, has not been directly observed.\u00a0 Dark matter could be made by massive particles interacting very weakly with regular matter.\u00a0 The Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) predicted by the Super Symmetric extensions of the Standard Model are an excellent candidate for dark matter. I am exploring new ideas on direct Dark Matter detection using argon and xenon as targets.\u00a0 I am a member of the WARP and DarkSide collaborations, which are carrying out a program for direct dark matter searches with argon.\u00a0 I am a member of the MAX collaboration, which is engineering two giant xenon and depleted argon detectors for the upcoming US national lab for underground physics. Solar Neutrinos : I am a member of the Borexino collaboration.\u00a0 Borexino is a liquid scintillator detector built and operated at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso .\u00a0 It is the only experiment ever built capable of observing in real time the low energy (<1 MeV) portion of the solar neutrino spectrum. Borexino is currently taking data, and we hope that our observation with the detector will help us solve some of the remaining puzzles on the Sun and on solar neutrinos. Teaching: 2010\/11 - PHY101 Research Opportunities : I am looking for graduate students to participate in the programs for direct detection of dark matter and measurement of solar neutrinos. G.
