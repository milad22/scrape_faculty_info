                "Virtually all known fluorophores exhibit mysterious episodes of emission intermittency. A remarkable feature of the phenomenon is a power-law distribution of on-and off-times observed in colloidal semiconductor quantum dots, nanorods, nanowires and some organic dyes. For nanoparticles, the resulting power law extends over an extraordinarily wide dynamic range: nine orders of magnitude in probability density and five to six orders of magnitude in time. Exponents hover about the ubiquitous value of\u2212 3\/2. Dark states routinely last for tens of seconds\u2014practically forever on quantum mechanical timescales. Despite such infinite states of darkness, the dots miraculously recover and start emitting again. Although the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains a mystery and many questions persist, we argue that substantial theoretical progress has been made.",
                "A serious obstacle impeding the application of low-and high-temperature superconductor devices is the presence of trapped magnetic flux 1, 2: flux lines or vortices can be induced by fields as small as the Earth's magnetic field. Once present, vortices dissipate energy and generate internal noise, limiting the operation of numerous superconducting devices 2, 3. Methods used to overcome this difficulty include the pinning of vortices by the incorporation of impurities and defects 4, the construction of flux \u2018dams\u20195, slots and holes 6, and magnetic shields 2, 3 which block the penetration of new flux lines in the bulk of the superconductor or reduce the magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the superconducting device. The most desirable method would be to remove the vortices from the bulk of the superconductor, but there was hitherto no known phenomenon that could form the basis for such a process.

Diploma, Roland E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Hungary, 1991 Ph.D., Cornell University, 1996 E-mail: bjanko@nd.edu Address: 333d Phone: (574) 631-8049 Fax: (574) 631-5952 Janko Group Website: http:\/\/sites.nd.edu\/condensed-matter-theory\/ Fundamentally new behavior has been documented in recent years in electronic systems showing strong correlation and extreme confinement. The condensed matter theory group led by Prof. Jank\u00f3 is actively participating in several major developments of this field, such as (i) spin control, manipulation and transport (spintronics), (ii) nanoscale superconductivity and magnetism in metallic and semiconductor quantum dots and quantum wires, and (iii) novel superconductivity (MgB2, high temperature superconductors) and magnetism (diluted magnetic semiconductors). Our theory projects within spintronics and nanoscience are performed parallel to and in close collaboration with the experimental research effort of our Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team ( NIRT ). This team, led by Professor Jank\u00f3, brings together researchers from four institutions (Notre Dame, Argonne National Lab, University of Illinois-Chicago and Duke University), with complementary expertise in superconductivity, magnetism and semiconductor science and technology. Within the NIRT project our research focuses on hybrid materials, such as the submicron-patterned superconductor-diluted magnetic semiconductor bi-layers. These structures are excellent candidates for hosting spin polarized, Zeeman localized electronic states which in turn could function as building blocks for spintronics applications. Our research is supported by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. \u201cQuantum rotor in nanostructured superconductors\u201d, S. H. Lin, M. V.
