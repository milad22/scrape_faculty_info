                "K.K. Mon, Associate Professor of Physics kkmon@uga.edu 706-542-3454 223D Biographical Information PhD, Cornell University , 1980 MS, Cornell University , 1976 I am a condensed matter physics theorist with over forty years of using analytical and large scale numerical techniques to study a wide range of fundamental and applied physical problems. Before coming to UGA in 1986, I was senior research physicist at Exxon Production Research in Houston. Over the years, my research interests includes: Random Matrix theory, quantum and classical fluids, device physics, liquid metals, phase transitions and critical phenomena, transport of liquid and gas in porous media, mechanical and electronic properties of superlattices and others. In recent years, I have also extended my research into studying elastic properties of nanostructures, thermodynamics and transport properties of gases and fluids in restricted geometry, fluid-mediated capillary forces in nanostructured arrays and low gas permeability in laminate composite fabric.
