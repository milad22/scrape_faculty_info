                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "New sets of parameters (\u201ctunes\u201d) for the underlying-event (UE) modelling of the pythia 8, pythia6 and herwig++ Monte Carlo event generators are constructed using different parton distribution functions. Combined fits to CMS UE proton\u2013proton () data at and to UE proton\u2013antiproton () data from the CDF experiment at lower, are used to study the UE models and constrain their parameters, providing thereby improved predictions for proton\u2013proton collisions at 13. In addition, it is investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons are presented of the UE tunes to \u201cminimum bias\u201d(MB) events, multijet, and Drell\u2013Yan ( lepton-antilepton+ jets) observables at 7 and 8, as well as predictions for MB and UE observables at 13 \u2026",
                "A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at TeV, and up to 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, \u03c4\u03c4, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ\u2192 4\u2113, gives a mass estimate of 125. 3\u00b10. 4 (stat.)\u00b10. 5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons. The measured values of the corresponding couplings are compared to the standard model predictions. The hypothesis of custodial symmetry is \u2026",
                "Modern general-purpose detectors at high-energy colliders are based on the concept of cylindrical detection layers, nested around the beam axis. Starting from the beam interaction region, particles first enter a tracker, in which charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and origins (vertices) are reconstructed from signals (hits) in the sensitive layers. The tracker is immersed in a magnetic field that bends the trajectories and allows the electric charges and momenta of charged particles to be measured. Electrons and photons are then absorbed in an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The corresponding electromagnetic showers are detected as clusters of energy recorded in neighbouring cells, from which the energy and direction of the particles can be determined. Charged and neutral hadrons may initiate a hadronic shower in the ECAL as well, which is subsequently fully absorbed in the hadron calorimeter (HCAL \u2026",
                "Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Comprehensive sets of production and decay measurements are combined. The decay channels include,,,,, and pairs. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 at 7 and up to 19.7 at 8. From the high-resolution and channels, the mass of the Higgs boson is determined to be. For this mass value, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay channels and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal relative to the standard model expectation is at the measured mass. The couplings of the Higgs boson are probed \u2026",
                "Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles emitted in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV are presented, using data collected with the CMS detector over a broad range of pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and azimuthal angle (\u03d5). Short-range correlations in \u0394\u03b7, which are studied in minimum bias events, are characterized using a simple \u201cindependent cluster\u201d parametrization in order to quantify their strength (cluster size) and their extent in \u03b7 (cluster decay width). Long-range azimuthal correlations are studied differentially as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum using a 980 nb\u2212 1 data set at 7 TeV. In high multiplicity events, a pronounced structure emerges in the two-dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate p T of 1\u20133 GeV\/c, 2.0<| \u0394\u03b7|< 4. 8 and \u0394\u03d5\u2248 0.

                "The transverse momentum spectra of charged particles have been measured in pp and PbPb collisions at  by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In the transverse momentum range p T=5\u201310 GeV\/c, the charged particle yield in the most central PbPb collisions is suppressed by up to a factor of 7 compared to the pp yield scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon\u2013nucleon collisions. At higher p T, this suppression is significantly reduced, approaching roughly a factor of 2 for particles with p T in the range p T=40\u2013100 GeV\/c.",

The analysis uses the entire dataset collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2011 and 2012 LHC running periods.
