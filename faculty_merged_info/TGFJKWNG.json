                "Seyed Mohammad  Hashemi Rafsanjani Asst. Professor sxh939@miami.edu I received my PhD in 2015 and then spent two years in the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester. My research interest includes different areas of quantum optics and entanglement. I am particularly interested in manipulating properties of light at the single photon level. That is to control a property of a single photon without losing (absorption) it. Our group is particularly interested in control, manipulation, and measurement of different properties of the transverse profile of single photons. Due to the multi-dimensional nature of these states, these systems can be used for encoding more than one bit of information per photon and can be deployed in various communication, sensing, and imaging applications.
