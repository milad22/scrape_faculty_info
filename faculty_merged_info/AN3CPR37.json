                "Bertrand I. Halperin Bertrand I. Halperin Hollis Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy, Emeritus Bertrand Halperin's research interests concern many aspects of the theory of condensed matter systems and statistical physics. Over the years, his work has included contributions to the theories of static and dynamic critical phenomena, including melting and other phase transitions in two-dimensional systems; quantum antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions, one-dimensional metals;\u00a0 superconductivity; low-temperature properties of glasses; and transport in inhomogeneous media.\u00a0 A major portion of Halperin's work has concerned properties of two-dimensional electron systems at low temperatures in strong magnetic fields, or \"quantum Hall systems.\" Much of his current research involves the theory of electron states and transport in small particles of a metal or semiconductor. \u00a0Much of this work has been motivated by experiments carried out in various laboratories at Harvard. ________________________ Liz Alcock Lyman 323 halperin@physics.harvard.edu p: (617) 495-4294 Condensed Matter Theory Group CV List of Publications"
