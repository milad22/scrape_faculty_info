                "Salvaging or functional replacement of damaged tissue caused by stroke in the brain remains a major therapeutic challenge. In situ gelation and retention of a hydrogel bioscaffold composed of 8 mg\/mL extracellular matrix (ECM) can induce a robust invasion of cells within 24 h and potentially promote a structural remodeling to replace lost tissue. Herein, we demonstrate a long-term retention of ECM hydrogel within the lesion cavity. A decrease of approximately 32% of ECM volume is observed over 12 weeks. Lesion volume, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging and histology, was reduced by 28%, but a battery of behavioral tests (bilateral asymmetry test; footfault; rotameter) did not reveal a therapeutic or detrimental effect of the hydrogel. Glial scarring and peri-infarct astrocytosis were equivalent between untreated and treated animals, potentially indicating that permeation into host tissue is required to \u2026",
                "Understanding the neurobiology and functional connectivity of hippocampal structures is essential for improving the treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. At the macroscale, in vivo MRI often reveals hippocampal atrophy and decreased fractional anisotropy, whereas at the microscopic scale, there frequently is evidence of neuronal loss and gliosis. Mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus (DG), with evidence of glutamatergic synapses in the stratum moleculare (SM) putatively originating from granule cell neurons, may also be observed. This aberrant connection between the DG and SM could produce a reverberant excitatory circuit. However, this hypothesis cannot easily be evaluated using macroscopic or microscopic techniques. We here demonstrate that the ex vivo mesoscopic MRI of surgically excised hippocampi can bridge the explanatory and analytical gap between the macro\u2010 and microscopic scale \u2026",
                "Intracerebral implantation of cell suspensions is finding its clinical translation with encouraging results in patients with stroke. However, the survival of cells in the brain remains poor. Although the biological potential of neural stem cells (NSCs) is widely documented, the biomechanical effects of delivering cells through a syringe-needle remain poorly understood. We here detailed the biomechanical forces (pressure, shear stress) that cells are exposed to during ejection through different sized needles (20G, 26G, 32G) and syringes (10, 50, 250 \u00b5L) at relevant flow rates (1, 5, 10 \u00b5L\/min). A comparison of 3 vehicles, Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), Hypothermosol (HTS), and Pluronic, indicated that less viscous vehicles are favorable for suspension with a high cell volume fraction to minimize sedimentation. Higher suspension viscosity was associated with greater shear stress. Higher flow rates with viscous vehicle \u2026",
                "The interpretation of cell transplantation experiments is often dependent on the presence of an exogenous label for the identification of implanted cells. The exogenous labels Hoechst 33342, 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU), PKH26, and Qtracker were compared for their labeling efficiency, cellular effects, and reliability to identify a human neural stem cell (hNSC) line implanted intracerebrally into the rat brain. Hoechst 33342 (2 mg\/ml) exhibited a delayed cytotoxicity that killed all cells within 7 days. This label was hence not progressed to in vivo studies. PKH26 (5 \u03bcM), Qtracker (15 nM), and BrdU (0.2 \u03bcM) labeled 100% of the cell population at day 1, although BrdU labeling declined by day 7. BrdU and Qtracker exerted effects on proliferation and differentiation. PKH26 reduced viability and proliferation at day 1, but this normalized by day 7. In an in vitro coculture assay, all labels transferred to unlabeled cells. After \u2026",
                "The structure and functions of the extracellular matrix (ECM), its spatial distribution and pericellular association of ECM molecules remain poorly understood. Colocalization of ECM molecules with cell phenotypes through immunohistochemistry can provide crucial insights into their juxtacrine signaling role as well as their structural relevance to tissue architecture. As manual quantification of images introduces intra- and inter-user bias and is cumbersome for high-throughput approaches, we implemented an automated high-throughput method to quantify the spatial distribution and cellular association of one ECM molecule, thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) with two major cell phenotypes, neurons, and astrocytes. The distribution of TSP1 was homogeneous throughout the striatum and cortex along the anterior\u2013posterior axis. TSP1 occupied 8.85% of the striatum and 7.40% in the cortex. TSP1 also associated with 94.58 \u2026"
