                "A review of the extant literature reveals that the theoretical underpinnings of the majority of loyalty program research rest on psychological mechanisms from three specific domains\u2014status, habit, and relational. We propose that to understand how loyalty programs actually work, a broader, more holistic research perspective is needed to account for the simultaneous effects across these three theoretical domains as well as both cross\u2010customer and temporal effects. The contribution of this approach is a fresh research agenda advanced in 15 research propositions.",
                "Achieving customer loyalty is a primary marketing goal, but building loyalty and reaping its rewards remain ongoing challenges. Theory suggests that loyalty comprises attitudes and purchase behaviors that benefit one seller over competitors. Yet researchers examining loyalty adopt widely varying conceptual and operational approaches. The present investigation examines the consequences of this heterogeneity by empirically mapping current conceptual approaches using an item-level coding of extant loyalty research, then testing how operational and study-specific characteristics moderate the strategy \u2192 loyalty \u2192 performance process through meta-analytic techniques. The results clarify dissimilarities in loyalty building strategies, how loyalty differentially affects performance and word of mouth, and the consequences of study-specific characteristics.

He collaborates on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland. The LHC is colliding protons at the highest energies ever achieved in the laboratory. These high-energy collisions have already uncovered the long-elusive Higgs boson, and it is hoped that they may perhaps reveal even more exotic new physics, such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions of space. Dr. Henderson previously collaborated on the CDF experiment at the Tevatron collider in Fermilab, and on the PHOBOS experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider in Brookhaven National Lab. Dr. Henderson received his PhD from MIT in 2005. He was a postdoctoral researcher at MIT from 2005 to 2008, and a CERN Fellow from 2008 to 2010.
