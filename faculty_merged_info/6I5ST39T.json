                "Ho-Ung  Yee, PhD Associate Professor 2250 SES (312) 996-5348 hyee@uic.edu Dr. Yee is broadly interested in non-perturbative aspects of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD), the theory governing quarks and gluons that constitute basic building blocks of nuclear matter, and his recent research has been focused on physics of heavy-ion collisions at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) and LHC (Large Hadron Collider) where new states of QCD matter with high temperature are created. He is currently interested in the effects originating from \"triangle anomaly\", a quantum mechanical violation of axial symmetry in P- and CP-odd environments, on the physics of heavy-ion collisions and the neutron stars.
