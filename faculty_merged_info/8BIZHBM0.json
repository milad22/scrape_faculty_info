Thin sheets are ubiquitous in nature and industry across a vast range of scales, from graphene to metal foil to the earth\u2019s crust. Our goal is to uncover the fundamental principles that govern the deformation of these materials when they are pushed far away from the low-energy or spatially-uniform states that they prefer.
