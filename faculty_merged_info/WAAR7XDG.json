                "We analyze the light scattered by a single InAs quantum dot interacting with a resonant continuous-wave laser. High-resolution spectra reveal clear distinctions between coherent and incoherent scattering, with the laser intensity spanning more than four orders of magnitude. We find that the fraction of coherently scattered photons can approach unity under sufficiently weak or detuned excitation, ruling out pure dephasing as a relevant decoherence mechanism. We show how spectral diffusion shapes spectra, correlation functions, and phase coherence, concealing the ideal radiatively broadened two-level system described by Mollow.",
                "Two-color second-order correlations of the light scattered near-resonantly by a quantum dot were measured by means of spectrally filtered coincidence detection. The effects of filter frequency and bandwidth were studied under monochromatic laser excitation, and a complete two-photon spectrum was reconstructed. The two-photon spectrum exhibits a rich structure associated with both real and virtual two-photon transitions down the \u201cdressed states\u201d ladder. Photon pairs generated via virtual transitions are found to violate the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a factor of 60. Our experiments are well described by the theoretical expressions obtained by del Valle et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 183601 (2012)] via time-and normally-ordered correlation functions.",
                "We report a Franson interferometry experiment based on correlated photon pairs generated via frequency-filtered scattered light from a near-resonantly driven two-level semiconductor quantum dot. In contrast to spontaneous parametric down-conversion and four-wave mixing, this approach can produce single pairs of correlated photons. We have measured a Franson visibility as high as 66%, which goes beyond the classical limit of 50% and approaches the limit of violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities (70.7%).",
                "We report on resonant light scattering experiments in which a single InAs quantum dot is exposed to two independently tunable continuous-wave lasers while the scattered light is analyzed background free, with high spectral and temporal resolution. In contrast to the well-known monochromatic case exhibiting Rabi oscillations, in this bichromatic case the additional field introduces oscillations at half the difference of the laser frequencies and harmonics thereof, persisting beyond the natural lifetime. The familiar \u201cdressed-states\u201d ladder now contains an infinite number of levels per manifold. With suitable averaging, the rich resulting spectra and second-order correlations can be reproduced accurately using the Bloch equations and the quantum regression theorem.",
                "We report the measurement of field-field and photon-photon correlations of light scattered by two InAs quantum dots separated by\u2248 40 \u03bc m. Near 4 K a large fraction of photons can be scattered coherently by each quantum dot leading to one-photon interference at a beam splitter (visibility\u2248 20%). Simultaneously, two-photon interference is also observed (visibility\u2248 40%) due to the indistinguishability of photons scattered by the two different quantum emitters. We show how spectral diffusion accounts for the reduction in interference visibility through variations in photon flux.",
                "We investigate the spectral and temporal properties of light scattered near resonantly by a single quantum dot when the incident laser field is a frequency comb consisting of a superposition of monochromatic waves equidistant in frequency. Such fields encompass those generated by, eg, a periodically pulsed laser. A general theoretical treatment for the calculation of first-and second-order correlation functions is given which takes account of spectral diffusion through a slowly varying detuning from resonance, permitting accurate comparison with experiments. We explore the two distinct regimes in which the frequency-comb separation is either larger or smaller than the radiative decay rate. We verify the validity of our calculations by a comparison with experimental data for the case of a bichromatic field and discuss the manifestation of phase coherence between the incoming field and the scattered single-photon \u2026",
                "Purcell enhanced Raman scattering (PERS) by means of a doubly resonant Fabry-Perot microcavity (mode volume \u2248 100\u2009\u03bcm3 and finesse \u2248 30\u2009000) has been investigated as a technique for isotopic ratio gas analysis. At the pump frequency, the resonant cavity supports a buildup of circulating power while simultaneously enabling Purcell spontaneous emission rate enhancement at the resonant Stokes frequency. The three most common isotopologues of CO2 gas were quantified, and a signal was obtained from 13C16O2 down to a partial pressure of 2\u2009Torr. Due to its small size and low pump power needed (\u223c10 mW) PERS lends itself to miniaturization. Furthermore, since the cavity is resonant with the emission frequency, future improvements could allow it to serve as its own spectral analyzer and no separate spectroscopic device would be needed.",
                "We report the experimental investigation of a regime of microscopic Fabry-Perot resonators in which competing light-induced forces\u2014photothermal expansion and photothermal refraction\u2014acting oppositely and on different timescales lead to self-sustained persistent oscillations. Previously concealed as ordinary thermo-optic bistability\u2014a common feature in low-loss resonator physics\u2014these dynamics are visible as fast pulsations in cavity transmission or reflection measurements at sufficiently high time resolution. Their underlying mathematical description is shared by many slow-fast phenomena in chemistry, biology, and neuroscience. Our observations are relevant in particular to microcavity applications in atom optics and cavity quantum electrodynamics, even in nominally rigid structures that have not undergone lithography.",
                "We investigated the first and second-order correlations of the light scattered near-resonantly by a quantum dot under excitation by a frequency comb, i.e., a periodically pulsed laser source. In contrast to its monochromatic counterpart, the pulsed resonance fluorescence spectrum features a superposition of sidebands distributed around a central peak with maximal sideband intensity near the Rabi frequency. Distinguishing between the coherently and incoherently scattered light reveals pulse-area dependent Rabi oscillations evolving with different phase for each component. Our observations, which can be reproduced theoretically, may impact schemes for remote entanglement based on pulsed two-photon interference.",
                "In this work, we present the measurement of laser-induced fluorescence from N2+ ions via the B2\u03a3+u \u2212 X2\u03a3+g band system in the near-ultraviolet. The ions were generated continuously by a plasma glow discharge in low pressure N2 and by a corona discharge in ambient air. The fluorescence decay time was found to rapidly decrease with increasing pressure leading to an extrapolated decay rate of \u224810 s\u22121 at atmospheric pressure. In spite of this quenching, we were able to observe laser induced fluorescence in ambient air by means of a time-gated spectral measurement. In the process of comparing the emission signal with that of N2 spontaneous Raman scattering, ion concentrations in ambient air of order 10-10 cm\u22123 were determined. With moderate increases in laser power and collection efficiency, ion concentrations of less than 10 cm\u22123 may be measurable, potentially enabling applications in atmospheric \u2026"
