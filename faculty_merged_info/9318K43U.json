                "Three-dimensional topological insulators are a new state of quantum matter with a bulk gap and odd number of relativistic Dirac fermions on the surface. By investigating the surface state of Bi2Te3 with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the surface state consists of a single nondegenerate Dirac cone. Furthermore, with appropriate hole doping, the Fermi level can be tuned to intersect only the surface states, indicating a full energy gap for the bulk states. Our results establish that Bi2Te3 is a simple model system for the three-dimensional topological insulator with a single Dirac cone on the surface. The large bulk gap of Bi2Te3 also points to promising potential for high-temperature spintronics applications.",
                "In addition to a bulk energy gap, topological insulators accommodate a conducting, linearly dispersed Dirac surface state. This state is predicted to become massive if time reversal symmetry is broken, and to become insulating if the Fermi energy is positioned inside both the surface and bulk gaps. We introduced magnetic dopants into the three-dimensional topological insulator dibismuth triselenide (Bi2Se3) to break the time reversal symmetry and further position the Fermi energy inside the gaps by simultaneous magnetic and charge doping. The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.",
                "High-temperature superconductivity often emerges in the proximity of a symmetry-breaking ground state. For superconducting iron arsenides, in addition to the antiferromagnetic ground state, a small structural distortion breaks the crystal\u2019s C4 rotational symmetry in the underdoped part of the phase diagram. We reveal that the representative iron arsenide Ba(Fe1\u2212xCox)2As2 develops a large electronic anisotropy at this transition via measurements of the in-plane resistivity of detwinned single crystals, with the resistivity along the shorter b axis \u03c1b being greater than \u03c1a. The anisotropy reaches a maximum value of ~2 for compositions in the neighborhood of the beginning of the superconducting dome. For temperatures well above the structural transition, uniaxial stress induces a resistivity anisotropy, indicating a substantial nematic susceptibility.",
                "Systematic measurements of the resistivity, heat capacity, susceptibility, and Hall coefficient are presented for single-crystal samples of the electron-doped superconductor Ba (Fe 1\u2212 x Co x) 2 As 2. These data delineate an x\u2212 T phase diagram in which the single magnetic\/structural phase transition that is observed for undoped BaFe 2 As 2 at 134 K appears to split into two distinct phase transitions, both of which are rapidly suppressed with increasing Co concentration. Superconductivity emerges for Co concentrations above x\u223c 0.025 and appears to coexist with the broken-symmetry state for an appreciable range of doping up to x\u223c 0.06. The optimal superconducting transition temperature appears to coincide with the Co concentration at which the magnetic\/structural phase transitions are totally suppressed, at least within the resolution provided by the finite-step size between crystals prepared with different doping \u2026",
                "The topological insulator is a unique state of matter that possesses a metallic surface state of massless particles known as Dirac fermions, which have coupled spin and momentum quantum numbers. Owing to the preservation of time-reversal symmetry, this coupling protects the wavefunctions against disorder 1, 2, 3. The experimental realization of this state of matter in Bi 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Te 3 has sparked considerable interest owing both to their potential use in spintronic devices and in the investigation of the fundamental nature of topologically non-trivial quantum matter. However, the conductivity of these compounds tends to be dominated by the bulk of the material because of chemical imperfection, making the transport properties of the surface nearly impossible to measure. We have systematically reduced the number of bulk carriers in Bi 2 Se 3 to the point where a magnetic field can collapse them to their \u2026",
                "Nematicity, defined as broken rotational symmetry, has recently been observed in competing phases proximate to the superconducting phase in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Similarly, the new iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition (i.e., a broken C4 symmetry) that either precedes or is coincident with a collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undoped parent compounds, and superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed via doping. Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of compounds has been reported by neutron scattering, scanning tunneling microscopy, and transport measurements. Here, we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of detwinned single crystals of a representative family of electron-doped iron-arsenide superconductors, Ba(Fe1-xCox)2 \u2026",
                "Scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies on high-quality Bi 2 Te 3 crystals exhibit perfect correspondence to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, hence enabling identification of different regimes measured in the local density of states (LDOS). Oscillations of LDOS near a step are analyzed. Within the main part of the surface band oscillations are strongly damped, supporting the hypothesis of topological protection. At higher energies, as the surface band becomes concave, oscillations appear, dispersing with a wave vector that may result from a hexagonal warping term.",
                "Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) are used to probe the Fermi surface of single crystals of Bi 2 Se 3. We find that SdH and ARPES probes quantitatively agree on measurements of the effective mass and bulk band dispersion. In high carrier density samples, the two probes also agree in the exact position of the Fermi level E F, but for lower carrier density samples discrepancies emerge in the position of E F. In particular, SdH reveals a bulk three-dimensional Fermi surface for samples with carrier densities as low as 10 17 cm\u2212 3. We suggest a simple mechanism to explain these differences and discuss consequences for existing and future transport studies of topological insulators.",
                "Within the Landau paradigm of continuous phase transitions, ordered states of matter are characterized by a broken symmetry. Although the broken symmetry is usually evident, determining the driving force behind the phase transition can be complicated by coupling between distinct order parameters. We show how measurement of the divergent nematic susceptibility of the iron pnictide superconductor Ba(Fe1\u2212xCox)2As2 distinguishes an electronic nematic phase transition from a simple ferroelastic distortion. These measurements also indicate an electronic nematic quantum phase transition near the composition with optimal superconducting transition temperature.",
                "Electron valley, a degree of freedom that is analogous to spin, can lead to novel topological phases in bilayer graphene. A tunable bandgap can be induced in bilayer graphene by an external electric field 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and such gapped bilayer graphene is predicted to be a topological insulating phase protected by no-valley mixing symmetry, featuring quantum valley Hall effects and chiral edge states 6, 7, 8, 9. Observation of such chiral edge states, however, is challenging because inter-valley scattering is induced by atomic-scale defects at real bilayer graphene edges 10. Recent theoretical work 11, 12, 13 has shown that domain walls between AB-and BA-stacked bilayer graphene can support protected chiral edge states of quantum valley Hall insulators. Here we report an experimental observation of ballistic (that is, with no scattering of electrons) conducting channels at bilayer graphene domain walls. We \u2026"
