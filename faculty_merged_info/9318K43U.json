                "Three-dimensional topological insulators are a new state of quantum matter with a bulk gap and odd number of relativistic Dirac fermions on the surface. By investigating the surface state of Bi2Te3 with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the surface state consists of a single nondegenerate Dirac cone. Furthermore, with appropriate hole doping, the Fermi level can be tuned to intersect only the surface states, indicating a full energy gap for the bulk states. Our results establish that Bi2Te3 is a simple model system for the three-dimensional topological insulator with a single Dirac cone on the surface. The large bulk gap of Bi2Te3 also points to promising potential for high-temperature spintronics applications.",
                "In addition to a bulk energy gap, topological insulators accommodate a conducting, linearly dispersed Dirac surface state. This state is predicted to become massive if time reversal symmetry is broken, and to become insulating if the Fermi energy is positioned inside both the surface and bulk gaps. We introduced magnetic dopants into the three-dimensional topological insulator dibismuth triselenide (Bi2Se3) to break the time reversal symmetry and further position the Fermi energy inside the gaps by simultaneous magnetic and charge doping. The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.",
                "High-temperature superconductivity often emerges in the proximity of a symmetry-breaking ground state. For superconducting iron arsenides, in addition to the antiferromagnetic ground state, a small structural distortion breaks the crystal\u2019s C4 rotational symmetry in the underdoped part of the phase diagram. We reveal that the representative iron arsenide Ba(Fe1\u2212xCox)2As2 develops a large electronic anisotropy at this transition via measurements of the in-plane resistivity of detwinned single crystals, with the resistivity along the shorter b axis \u03c1b being greater than \u03c1a. The anisotropy reaches a maximum value of ~2 for compositions in the neighborhood of the beginning of the superconducting dome. For temperatures well above the structural transition, uniaxial stress induces a resistivity anisotropy, indicating a substantial nematic susceptibility.",
                "Systematic measurements of the resistivity, heat capacity, susceptibility, and Hall coefficient are presented for single-crystal samples of the electron-doped superconductor Ba (Fe 1\u2212 x Co x) 2 As 2. These data delineate an x\u2212 T phase diagram in which the single magnetic\/structural phase transition that is observed for undoped BaFe 2 As 2 at 134 K appears to split into two distinct phase transitions, both of which are rapidly suppressed with increasing Co concentration. Superconductivity emerges for Co concentrations above x\u223c 0.025 and appears to coexist with the broken-symmetry state for an appreciable range of doping up to x\u223c 0.06. The optimal superconducting transition temperature appears to coincide with the Co concentration at which the magnetic\/structural phase transitions are totally suppressed, at least within the resolution provided by the finite-step size between crystals prepared with different doping \u2026",
                "The topological insulator is a unique state of matter that possesses a metallic surface state of massless particles known as Dirac fermions, which have coupled spin and momentum quantum numbers. Owing to the preservation of time-reversal symmetry, this coupling protects the wavefunctions against disorder 1, 2, 3. The experimental realization of this state of matter in Bi 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Te 3 has sparked considerable interest owing both to their potential use in spintronic devices and in the investigation of the fundamental nature of topologically non-trivial quantum matter. However, the conductivity of these compounds tends to be dominated by the bulk of the material because of chemical imperfection, making the transport properties of the surface nearly impossible to measure. We have systematically reduced the number of bulk carriers in Bi 2 Se 3 to the point where a magnetic field can collapse them to their \u2026",
                "Nematicity, defined as broken rotational symmetry, has recently been observed in competing phases proximate to the superconducting phase in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Similarly, the new iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition (i.e., a broken C4 symmetry) that either precedes or is coincident with a collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undoped parent compounds, and superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed via doping. Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of compounds has been reported by neutron scattering, scanning tunneling microscopy, and transport measurements. Here, we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of detwinned single crystals of a representative family of electron-doped iron-arsenide superconductors, Ba(Fe1-xCox)2 \u2026",
                "Scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies on high-quality Bi 2 Te 3 crystals exhibit perfect correspondence to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, hence enabling identification of different regimes measured in the local density of states (LDOS). Oscillations of LDOS near a step are analyzed. Within the main part of the surface band oscillations are strongly damped, supporting the hypothesis of topological protection. At higher energies, as the surface band becomes concave, oscillations appear, dispersing with a wave vector that may result from a hexagonal warping term.",
                "Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) are used to probe the Fermi surface of single crystals of Bi 2 Se 3. We find that SdH and ARPES probes quantitatively agree on measurements of the effective mass and bulk band dispersion. In high carrier density samples, the two probes also agree in the exact position of the Fermi level E F, but for lower carrier density samples discrepancies emerge in the position of E F. In particular, SdH reveals a bulk three-dimensional Fermi surface for samples with carrier densities as low as 10 17 cm\u2212 3. We suggest a simple mechanism to explain these differences and discuss consequences for existing and future transport studies of topological insulators.",
                "Within the Landau paradigm of continuous phase transitions, ordered states of matter are characterized by a broken symmetry. Although the broken symmetry is usually evident, determining the driving force behind the phase transition can be complicated by coupling between distinct order parameters. We show how measurement of the divergent nematic susceptibility of the iron pnictide superconductor Ba(Fe1\u2212xCox)2As2 distinguishes an electronic nematic phase transition from a simple ferroelastic distortion. These measurements also indicate an electronic nematic quantum phase transition near the composition with optimal superconducting transition temperature.",
                "Electron valley, a degree of freedom that is analogous to spin, can lead to novel topological phases in bilayer graphene. A tunable bandgap can be induced in bilayer graphene by an external electric field 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and such gapped bilayer graphene is predicted to be a topological insulating phase protected by no-valley mixing symmetry, featuring quantum valley Hall effects and chiral edge states 6, 7, 8, 9. Observation of such chiral edge states, however, is challenging because inter-valley scattering is induced by atomic-scale defects at real bilayer graphene edges 10. Recent theoretical work 11, 12, 13 has shown that domain walls between AB-and BA-stacked bilayer graphene can support protected chiral edge states of quantum valley Hall insulators. Here we report an experimental observation of ballistic (that is, with no scattering of electrons) conducting channels at bilayer graphene domain walls. We \u2026"

He received his B.Sc. in physics from Canterbury University in 2001 and his D. Phil. from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes' Scholar in 2006. At Oxford, he worked with Stephen Blundell and Arzhang Ardavan on experimental and computational studies of quasi-two dimensional organic superconductors. Following his graduate studies, Analytis was a Lloyd's Tercentenary Fellow at the University of Bristol, where he worked on understanding the nature of anisotropic scattering in cuprate superconductors. In 2008 he became a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford University where he worked on both pnictide superconductors and topological insulators. In 2010 Analytis became a staff scientist at the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Science. The Analytis lab at Berkeley is capable of creating new materials and characterizing their thermodynamic and transport properties, particularly in the presence of high magnetic fields. The Analytis lab makes extensive use of the facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Lab, where fields of up to 45T (static) and 100T (pulsed) are available. My research focuses on the discovery and understanding of exotic materials manifesting novel quantum phenomena that have both fundamental and technological implications, particularly superconductors, exotic magnets and topological insulators. Many of the physical problems I am interested in transcend a single material, and in my view each compound can lend a new insight into a given question. Where possible, my strategy is to use materials as a tool to get to scientifically important problems by designing and tuning their properties.  Our understanding of condensed matter physics is driven by the discovery of new materials. Before the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates, few would have suspected that oxides would harbor such a variety of quantum properties, and before the availability of high-mobility GaAs, none predicted the spectacular properties of the fractional quantum Hall states. My lab's focus is to create materials with properties that are at the boundary of our understanding of condensed matter physics.  The present focus of my lab is in primarily three questions: (i) can we understand the properties of a system near a quantum critical point in a universal manner, or does it depend on the details? (ii) how are interactions between quantum particles affected by their geometry (their \u201ctopological\u201d properties)? (iii) can we manipulate the properties of a material so that its quantum nature can be observed at ordinary temperatures and pressures?. UNCONVENTIONAL SUPERCONDUCTIVITY: The quasiparticle dynamics about the Fermi surface in the normal state of a superconductor is arguably the most important characterization in terms of understanding the mechanism behind the superconducting pairing. One of the key research directions in the Analytis lab is to perform detailed, three-dimensional studies of the Fermi surface using magneto-transport, quantum oscillations and thermal transport techniques. Materials we study include Fe-based superconductors, thin-film cuprates, ruthenates and topological superconductors. TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS: Relativistic effects in materials are rarely significant, but when strong spin-orbit interactions (SOI) are present these can be the most important detail. This is the case for the rapidly emerging field of topological insulators \u2013 materials which are insulators in the bulk but, due to a curious affect of the SOI on the band structure, have a conducting surface state. A specific difficulty in this field turns out to be that the present materials themselves are poor insulators in the bulk, making the surface properties very difficult to measure. One of the projects in the Analytis lab will be to create and control new materials which are topologically non-trivial. We will focus on materials whose structure and chemistry lends the compound to \u201cengineering\u201d of the crystal field environment and\/or the doping. Furthermore, oxide systems with strong correlations (such as iridates and osmates) provide a new and largely unexplored field where minimizing the Coulomb energy competes with the topological properties of the system, leading to exciting new ground states. QUANTUM DIMENSIONALITY & THE PHYSICS OF LUTTINGER LIQUIDS: Dimensionality plays an important role in condensed matter systems, particularly with regard to superconductivity. When systems are one dimensional (metallic in one direction but insulating in all others) bizarre things can occur, including the separation of spin and charge \u2013 the so-called Luttinger liquid. However, a material will have a given dimensionality in equilibrium and it is difficult to understand how these effects can be distinguished. One of our projects is to develop an experimental apparatus where the electronic overlap in different crystalline directions can by continuously tuned. Through this, we hope to observe how the properties of a quasi-two dimensional liquid evolve toward a one dimensional liquid. Jiun-Haw Chu, Hsueh-Hui Kuo, James G. Analytis and Ian R.
