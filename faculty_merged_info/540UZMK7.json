                "The Fifth Edition of the \u2018Guide to Receptors and Channels\u2019 is a compilation of the major pharmacological targets divided into seven sections: G protein\u2010coupled receptors, ligand\u2010gated ion channels, ion channels, catalytic receptors, nuclear receptors, transporters and enzymes. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside suggestions for further reading. Available alongside this publication is a portal at http:\/\/www.GuideToPharmacology.org which is produced in close association with NC\u2010IUPHAR and allows free online access to the information presented in the Fifth Edition.",
                "The great proliferation of drug targets in recent years has driven the need to organise and condense the information in a logical way. This is the underlying reason for this Guide to Receptors and Channels, distributed with the British Journal of Pharmacology. Our intent is to produce an authoritative but user-friendly publication, which allows a rapid overview of the key properties of a wide range of established or potential pharmacological targets. The aim is to provide information succinctly, so that a newcomer to a particular target group can identify the main elements \u2018at a glance\u2019. It is not our goal to produce all-inclusive reviews of the targets presented; references to these are included in the Further Reading sections of the entries. The Guide to Receptors and Channels presents each entry, typically a circumscribed target class family on, wherever possible, a single page, so as to allow easy access and rapid \u2026",
                "There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). Ligands activating these G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) include the phytocannabinoid \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol, numerous synthetic compounds, and endogenous compounds known as endocannabinoids. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists have also been developed. Some of these ligands activate or block one type of cannabinoid receptor more potently than the other type. This review summarizes current data indicating the extent to which cannabinoid receptor ligands undergo orthosteric or allosteric interactions with non-CB1, non-CB2 established GPCRs, deorphanized receptors such as GPR55, ligand-gated ion channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and other ion channels or peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors. From these data, it is clear that some ligands that interact similarly with CB1 and\/or CB2 \u2026",

                "The IUPHAR\/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb, www.guidetopharmacology.org) and its precursor IUPHAR-DB, have captured expert-curated interactions between targets and ligands from selected papers in pharmacology and drug discovery since 2003. This resource continues to be developed in conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS). As previously described, our unique model of content selection and quality control is based on 96 target-class subcommittees comprising 512 scientists collaborating with in-house curators. This update describes content expansion, new features and interoperability improvements introduced in the 10 releases since August 2015. Our relationship matrix now describes \u223c9000 ligands, \u223c15 000 binding constants, \u223c6000 papers and \u223c1700 human proteins. As an important \u2026",

Developed by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS), this resource, and its earlier incarnation as IUPHAR-DB, is described in our 2014 publication. This update incorporates changes over the intervening seven database releases. The unique model of content capture is based on established and new target class subcommittees collaborating with in-house curators. Most information comes from journal articles, but we now also index kinase cross-screening panels. Targets are specified by UniProtKB IDs. Small molecules are defined by PubChem Compound Identifiers (CIDs); ligand capture also includes peptides \u2026",

I also teach PHY111, Astronomy & Space Physics, and PHY311, Contemporary Astronomy, the third course in our thematic sequence, \"Your Place in the Universe.\" My group's research centers around computational astrophysics, where we attempt to solve astronomical problems employing computational physics. These problems have consisted of many issues associated with the formation of solar systems and the orbital and rotational evolution of planetary satellites. Recently, we adapted our codes to study self-bound gravitating systems like stellar clusters and galaxies. Here, we are simulating the motion of stars in Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies using an alternative to the dark matter paradigm, i.e. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)."
