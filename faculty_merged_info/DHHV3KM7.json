                "We describe synthesis and applications of nonsupported semiconducting porous structures that can be used as photocatalysts for photodegradation of organic pollutants in aqueous environments. The photocatalysts, T1O2 aerogels, are prepared through the sol-gel method and supercritical point drying. These materials have a porosity of 85%, a BET surface area of 600 m2\/g, and a bulk density of 0.5 g\/cm3. X-ray diffraction show the anatase crystalline phase with a crystallite size of 50 \u00c1. The surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of these materials depend on the preparation conditions. The photoassisted oxidation of salicylic acid on these materials was compared to that obtained with commercial (P-25) T1O2 powder. The aerogel shows a much higher photocatalytic activity.",
                "We report on the application of Raman scattering as a probe to follow the structural evolution of TiO2 aerogels. We have traced the evolution of the 142 and 630 cm-1 Eg anatase peaks as a function of morphology. The results have been analyzed in terms of the q vector relaxation mechanism which predicts a unique relation between particle size and features of the Raman spectra. Since the phonon dispersion of anatase is not known, we have used the analogous rutile dispersion. There is good agreement between the particle sizes evaluated from the model and those determined by X-ray diffraction. Our results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be an effective tool in monitoring the evolution of these aerogel systems. ",
                "The use of semiconductors, as photoelectrodes in electrolytic cells for the electrolysis of water, is described and the results reported in the literature for various semiconductors are reviewed. The most important properties of the semiconductor are shown to be the band-gap energyE  g , and the flat-band potentialU  fb . The semiconductor absorbs photons that are more energetic than the band-gap energy and creates electronhole pairs. These charge carriers can be separated before recombination by the electric field at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. For electrolysis to proceed, the potential corresponding to the band gap must appreciably exceed the standard potential for the electrolysis of water, 1.23 volts. In addition, the flat-band potential must be more negative than the hydrogen potential or an external bias voltage is required. The \u2026",
                "The flatband potentials of in aqueous electrolytes at different pH values were evaluated. The flatband potentials were measured by extrapolating the intercepts of Mott\u2010Schottky plots to the zero doping level. The capacitance values for the Mott\u2010Schottky plots were measured by relaxation spectrum analysis of the passive elements in the equivalent circuit of the electrolyte interface. The Mott\u2010Schottky plots used for evaluation of the flatband potential were linear over a potential range that exceeds 70% of the bandgap. It has been shown that when the doping distribution is homogeneous, the presence of surface states can be responsible for nonlinear Mott\u2010Schottky plots. The number, energy, and energy distribution of those states has been determined. The flatband potential of has been found to vary with pH at the rate of 60 mV\/pH unit and is 100 mV more negative than the potential of reversible hydrogen electrode \u2026",
                "The current\u2010voltage characteristics and the bias dependence of the etch rates of< 100>\u2010and< 111>\u2010oriented n\u2010and p\u2010type low doped Si samples in aqueous have been studied. We find that voltages cathodic of the open\u2010circuit potential have little effect on the p\u2010type etch rates, while the n\u2010type etching is stopped. Anodic of the open\u2010circuit potential, both carrier types stop etching, owing to passivation of the surface. These results are used to characterize the rate\u2010determining steps of the chemical or electrochemical reactions which take place at the semiconductor surface at various biases. A mechanism is proposed in which the rate\u2010determining step shifts between among chemical, electrochemical, or diffusion limited. Also, a mechanism involving susceptibility to nucleophilic attack is proposed to explain the vastly different etching rates of< 100> and< 110> vs.< 111> faces.",
                "In this paper we will try to demonstrate that in nanostructured materials the scaling of many of the material properties that are important for catalytic activity diverges as one approaches nanosize dimensions. We will discuss size-induced critical properties that include transport, polarizability and adsorption properties. The macroscopic context will be demonstrated in terms of three main applications of nanocrystalline, semiconducting, photocatalytic materials with particular emphasis on nanocrystalline TiO2. These applications include: liquid-junction photovoltaic solar cells; photodecomposition of organic compounds with nanocrystalline photocatalysts and light-induced wetting properties.",
                "We describe the mechanisms for galvanostatic electrodeposition of in terms of competition between chemical reactions that lead to Se formation and electrochemical reduction of Se as polyselenide, at the interfaces between selenium and selenide. This mechanism leads to a cauliflower morphology for the resulting film. This morphology is ideal for a photoanode in the liquid junction solar cell configuration, and we describe the performance of such an electrode. In spite of the unique morphology, solid\u2010state properties of the film can be evaluated and the methodology for these evaluations is presented. The performance of the liquid junction solar cells is limited by the dark current and the dielectric properties of the material. We also describe the effects of metal ions such as Zn+ 2, Ru+ 3, and Ga+ 3 on the various electrode properties.",
                "We describe here the experimental conditions under which the photoelectrochemical etching (PEC\u2010etching) of n\u2010type silicon in induces the formation of porous silicon. Two types of porous silicon are formed underneath an etch crater: a layer of nanoporous material with pores in the nanometer range on top of a macroporous layer with pores in the micron range. The form of the macropores changes with the crystallographic orientation. We report on the evolution of these different features with the quantity of charge passed during the PEC and other etching parameters.",
                "We have generalized the single\u2010particle diffusion\u2010limited aggregation process to both multiparticles and aggregation on an initially smooth surface. The computer simulation is done as a function of\" concentration\" of the particles and the sticking coefficient to the surface. These parameters are correlated with electrochemical parameters such as overpotential, limiting current, exchange current, and electrolyte concentration. The correlations between the two sets of parameters permits direct comparison between simulation and experiment. The transition between\" mossy\" deposits and fully developed dendritic growth is recorded. The simulation reproduces the presence of a critical overpotential and an initiation time. The fundamental interdependence of these parameters and their dependence on the concentration of the electrolyte, quantitatively resemble that of the observed dendrite growth in electrodeposition of Zn \u2026",
                "A new technique to evaluate the equivalent circuit elements of a semiconductor\u2010electrolyte interface is presented. The technique is based on impedance measurements over a wide frequency range. We present results on n\u2010type electrolyte interfaces, which we can represent in terms of an equivalent circuit of passive elements. The equivalent circuit was interpreted in terms of two space charge layers with two different doping levels. The effect of surface treatment on the relative areas and on the lateral distribution of the two regions is also presented."
