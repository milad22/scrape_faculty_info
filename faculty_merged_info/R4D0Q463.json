                "Shor and Grover demonstrated that a quantum computer can outperform any classical computer in factoring numbers 1 and in searching a database 2 by exploiting the parallelism of quantum mechanics. Whereas Shor's algorithm requires both superposition and entanglement of a many-particle system 3, the superposition of single-particle quantum states is sufficient for Grover's algorithm 4. Recently, the latter has been successfully implemented 5 using Rydberg atoms. Here we propose an implementation of Grover's algorithm that uses molecular magnets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which are solid-state systems with a large spin; their spin eigenstates make them natural candidates for single-particle systems. We show theoretically that molecular magnets can be used to build dense and efficient memory devices based on the Grover algorithm. In particular, one single crystal can serve as a storage unit of a dynamic random \u2026",
                "We present a comprehensive theory of the magnetization relaxation in a Mn 12-acetate crystal in the high-temperature regime (T\u2273 1 K), which is based on phonon-assisted spin tunneling induced by quartic magnetic anisotropy and weak transverse magnetic fields. The overall relaxation rate as function of the longitudinal magnetic field is calculated and shown to agree well with experimental data including all resonance peaks measured so far. The Lorentzian shape of the resonances, which we obtain via a generalized master equation that includes spin tunneling, is also in good agreement with recent data. We derive a general formula for the tunnel splitting energy of these resonances. We show that fourth-order diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian lead to satellite peaks. A derivation of the effective linewidth of a resonance peak is given and shown to agree well with experimental data. In addition, previously unknown \u2026",
                "By creating defects via oxygen plasma treatment, we demonstrate optical properties variation of single-layer MoS2. We found that, with increasing plasma exposure time, the photoluminescence (PL) evolves from very high intensity to complete quenching, accompanied by gradual reduction and broadening of MoS2 Raman modes, indicative of distortion of the MoS2 lattice after oxygen bombardment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study shows the appearance of the Mo6+ peak, suggesting the creation of MoO3 disordered regions in the MoS2 flake. Finally, using band structure calculations, we demonstrate that the creation of MoO3 disordered domains upon exposure to oxygen plasma leads to a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition in single-layer MoS2, which explains the observed PL quenching.",
                "We have demonstrated that the electrical property of single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can be significantly tuned from the semiconducting to the insulating regime via controlled exposure to oxygen plasma. The mobility, on-current and resistance of single-layer MoS2 devices were varied by up to four orders of magnitude by controlling the plasma exposure time. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory studies suggest that the significant variation of electronic properties is caused by the creation of insulating MoO3-rich disordered domains in the MoS2 sheet upon oxygen plasma exposure, leading to an exponential variation of resistance and mobility as a function of plasma exposure time. The resistance variation calculated using an effective medium model is in excellent agreement with the measurements. The simple approach described here can be used for the \u2026",
                "We show that it is possible to topologically induce or quench the Kondo resonance in the conductance of a single-molecule magnet (S> 1\/2) strongly coupled to metallic leads. This can be achieved by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the molecule easy axis and works for both full-and half-integer spin cases. The effect is caused by the Berry-phase interference between two quantum tunneling paths of the molecule\u2019s spin. We have calculated the renormalized Berry-phase oscillations of the Kondo peaks as a function of the transverse magnetic field as well as the conductance of the molecule by means of the poor man\u2019s scaling method. We propose to use a new variety of the single-molecule magnet Ni 4 for the experimental observation of this phenomenon.",
                "We present a comprehensive theory of the magnetization relaxation in a Mn 12-acetate crystal based on thermally assisted spin tunneling induced by quartic anisotropy and weak transverse magnetic fields. The overall relaxation rate as a function of the magnetic field is calculated and shown to agree well with data including all resonance peaks. The Lorentzian shape of the resonances is also in good agreement with recent data. A generalized master equation including resonances is derived and solved exactly. It is shown that many transition paths with comparable weight exist that contribute to the relaxation process. Previously unknown spin-phonon coupling constants are calculated explicitly.",
                "We propose a teleportation scheme that relies only on single-photon measurements and Faraday rotation, for teleportation of many-qubit entangled states stored in the electron spins of a quantum dot system. The interaction between a photon and the two electron spins, via Faraday rotation in microcavities, establishes Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement in the spin-photon-spin system. The appropriate single-qubit measurements, and the communication of two classical bits, produce teleportation. This scheme provides the essential link between spintronic and photonic quantum information devices by permitting quantum information to be exchanged between them.",
                "We generalize the Landau-Zener theory of coherent tunneling transitions by taking thermal relaxation into account. The evaluation of a generalized master equation containing a dynamic tunneling rate that includes the interaction between the relevant system and its environment leads to an incoherent Zener transition probability with an exponent that is twice as large as the one of the coherent Zener probability in the limit T\u2192 0. We apply our results to molecular clusters, in particular to recent measurements of the tunneling transition of spins in Fe 8 crystals performed by Wernsdorfer and Sessoli [Science 284, 133 (1999)].",
                "We formulate the problem of electron transport through a single-molecule magnet (SMM) in the Coulomb blockade regime taking into account topological interference effects for the tunneling of the large spin of a SMM. The interference originates from spin Berry phases associated with different tunneling paths. We show that, in the case of incoherent spin states, it is essential to place the SMM between oppositely spin-polarized source and drain leads in order to detect the spin tunneling in the stationary current, which exhibits topological zeros as a function of the transverse magnetic field.",
                "We present a careful and thorough microscopic derivation of the anisotropic Kondo Hamiltonian for single-molecule magnet (SMM) transistors. When the molecule is strongly coupled to metallic leads, we show that by applying a transverse magnetic field it is possible to topologically induce or quench the Kondo effect in the conductance of a SMM with either an integer or a half-integer spin S> 1\/2. This topological Kondo effect is due to the Berry-phase interference between multiple quantum tunneling paths of the spin. We calculate the renormalized Berry-phase oscillations of the two Kondo peaks as a function of the transverse magnetic field by means of the poor man\u2019s scaling. In particular, we show that the Kondo exchange interaction between itinerant electrons in the leads and the SMM pseudospin 1\/2 depends crucially on the SMM spin selection rules for the addition and subtraction of an electron and can range \u2026"
