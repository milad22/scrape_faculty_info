                "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health 1, 2, 3. Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID \u2018events\u2019(origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or \u2026",
                "Did the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, by eliminating non-avian dinosaurs and most of the existing fauna, trigger the evolutionary radiation of present-day mammals? Here we construct, date and analyse a species-level phylogeny of nearly all extant Mammalia to bring a new perspective to this question. Our analyses of how extant lineages accumulated through time show that net per-lineage diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous\/Tertiary boundary. Instead, these rates spiked significantly with the origins of the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately 93 million years ago, before falling and remaining low until accelerating again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. Our results show that the phylogenetic \u2018fuses\u2019 leading to the explosion of extant placental orders are not only very much longer than suspected previously, but also challenge the \u2026"

Many of these studies have been performed on short-lived nuclei around doubly-magic 132 Sn. This region is important as the nuclear shell structure influences the path of the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, which is responsible for the production of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron. Other projects I'm working on include studying resonant reactions in light neutron-deficient nuclei, important in nova nucleosynthesis and X-ray bursts. I am leading efforts to develop proton-transfer reactions to be used with radioactive ion beams and developing an advanced scintillator array for gamma-ray measurements, HAGRiD. Creative Teaching Dr. Jones teaches Physics 341, a requirement for all students of nuclear engineering and an upper-level physics elective.  She was concerned about the lack of fit between a 1988 text and current research in the field. To remedy this, she revised the course structure to incorporate group research projects, so that students could extend the foundational material in the text by investigating and sharing current ideas and research in the field of nuclear physics.
