                "Arc volcanism is intimately linked to mineral dehydration reactions in the subducting oceanic mantle, crust, and sediments. The location of slab dehydration reactions depends strongly on the temperature and pressure conditions at the top of the subducting plate and hence on the detailed thermal structure of subduction zones. A particularly important physical property of subduction zone thermal models is the viscosity of the mantle wedge. The introduction of an olivine rheology, with appropriate stress and temperature dependence, focuses flow into the tip of the mantle wedge. This leads to a temperature increase of a few hundred degrees in the wedge and the top of the slab as compared to the isoviscous case. Sensitivity tests show that this conclusion is robust under a variety of subduction zone parameters. The new high\u2010resolution finite element models are used to reevaluate the thermal structure of the Honshu \u2026",
                "Catalysis by single isolated atoms of precious metals has attracted much recent interest, as it promises the ultimate in atom efficiency. Most previous reports are on reducible oxide supports. Here we show that isolated palladium atoms can be catalytically active on industrially relevant \u03b3-alumina supports. The addition of lanthanum oxide to the alumina, long known for its ability to improve alumina stability, is found to also help in the stabilization of isolated palladium atoms. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm the presence of intermingled palladium and lanthanum on the \u03b3-alumina surface. Carbon monoxide oxidation reactivity measurements show onset of catalytic activity at 40 C. The catalyst activity can be regenerated by oxidation at 700 C in air. The high-temperature stability and regenerability of these ionic palladium species make \u2026",
                "First-principles DFT computations are performed to explain the origin and the mechanism of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Co\u2013Nx (x = 2, 4) based self-assembled carbon supported electrocatalysts in alkaline and acidic media. The results show that the formation of graphitic Co\u2013N4 defect is energetically more favorable than the formation of graphitic Co\u2013N2 defect. Furthermore graphitic Co\u2013N4 defects are predicted to be stable at all potentials (U = 0\u20131.23 V) in the present study while Co\u2013N2 defects are predicted to be unstable at high potentials. Therefore the Co\u2013N4 defect is predicted to be the dominant in-plane graphitic defect in Co\u2013Nx\/C electrocatalysts. O2 chemisorbs to Co\u2013N4 and Co\u2013N2 defects indicating that both defect motifs are active for the reduction of O2 to peroxide. However, the weak interaction between peroxide and Co\u2013N4 defect shows that this defect does not promote complete ORR and a \u2026",
                "Our results validate the use of independent DFT predicted BE shifts for defect identification and constraining ambient pressure XPS observations for Me\u2013Nx moieties in pyrolyzed carbon based ORR electrocatalysts. This supports the understanding of such catalysts as vacancy-and-substitution defects in a graphene-like matrix.",
                "Recently, sophisticated theoretical computational studies have proposed several new crystal structures of carbon (eg, bct-C 4, H-, M-, R-, S-, W-and Z-carbon). However, until now, there lacked experimental evidence to verify the predicted high-pressure structures for cold-compressed elemental carbon at least up to 50 GPa. Here we present direct experimental evidence that this enigmatic high-pressure structure is currently only consistent with M-carbon, one of the proposed carbon structures. Furthermore, we show that this phase transition is extremely sluggish, which led to the observed broad x-ray diffraction peaks in previous studies and hindered the proper identification of the post-graphite phase in cold-compressed carbon.",
                "The electronic and magnetic properties of graphene can be modified through combined transition-metal and nitrogen decoration of vacancies. In this study, we used density functional theory to investigate the following defect motifs: nitrogen doping, nitrogen decoration of single and double vacancies (SVs and DVs), TM doping (TM = Co, Fe), TM adsorption on nitrogen-doped graphene, and combined TM\u2013nitrogen chemistries in SV and DV (TM\u2013Nx) configurations. The results show that the highest magnetic moments are supported in TM\u2013Nx defect motifs. Among these defects, Co\u2013N3, Fe\u2013N3, and Fe\u2013N4 defects are predicted to show ferromagnetic spin structures with high magnetic moments and magnetic stabilization energies, as well as enhanced stability as expressed by favorable formation energies, and high TM binding energies.",
                "First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to explain the stability of catalytically active sites in Fe\u2013Nx\u2013C electrocatalysts, their ORR activity and ORR mechanism. The results show that the formation of graphitic in-plane Fe\u2013N4 sites in a carbon matrix is energetically favorable over the formation of Fe\u2013N2 sites. Chemisorption of ORR species O2, O, OH, OOH, and H2O and O\u2013O bond breaking in peroxide occur on both Fe\u2013N2 and Fe\u2013N4 sites. In addition to the favorable interaction of ORR species, the computed free energy diagrams show that elementary ORR reaction steps on Fe\u2013Nx sites are downhill. Thus, a complete ORR is predicted to occur via a single site 4e\u2212 mechanism on graphitic Fe\u2013Nx (x = 2, 4) sites. Because of their higher stability and working potential for ORR, Fe\u2013N4 sites are predicted to be prime candidate sites for ORR in pyrolyzed Fe\u2013Nx\u2013C electrocatalysts.",
                "Graphitic Ni\u2013Nx (x = 2, 4) and Ni\u2013N2 edge defect motifs in Ni\u2013Nx\/C electrocatalyst and their ORR activity are studied using density functional theory. The results show that the formation of graphitic Ni\u2013Nx and Ni\u2013N2 edge defects is energetically favorable. Furthermore, the computations predict that O2 and peroxide both chemisorb to Ni\u2013N2 edge site but not to graphitic Ni\u2013N2 and Ni\u2013N4 sites. This indicates that ORR in Ni\u2013Nx\/C electrocatalyst occurs predominantly on edge sites via a sequential 2 \u00d7 2e\u2013 process in alkaline and acidic media. The free energy diagram for O2 reduction on Ni\u2013N2 edge defect shows fewer uphill processes in alkaline medium than in acidic medium, predicting that Ni\u2013Nx\/C ORR electrocatalyst is more active in alkaline medium, especially at high potentials. We find that the presence of magnetism in Ni\u2013N2 edge site decreases the adsorption energy of H2O2 by \u223c37% as compared to the \u2026",
                "We calculated the elasticity of (Mg,Fe)SiO3\u2010perovskite, using the plane\u2010wave pseudopotential method for a pressure range that encompasses the earth's lower mantle. Adding 25 mol% FeSiO3 to the Mg endmember decreases the shear modulus by 6% at zero pressure and by 8% at core mantle boundary pressures. The bulk modulus is less affected by iron, increasing by 2% at zero pressure and by 1% at the base of the mantle. For the isotropically averaged wave velocities we find that the compressional wave velocity decreases by 4% independent of pressure and the shear wave velocity decreases by 6% and 7% at zero pressure and at 136 GPa, repectively. For the relative variation of shear to compressional velocities at constant pressure due to variations in Fe\u2010content we find R = 1.6 at 136 GPa and for the relative variation of shear to bulk sound velocities we find \u03be = 2.6 at 136 GPa.",
                "A detailed analysis of the physiochemical nature, thermodynamic properties, and electrochemical characterization of N motifs present in self\u2010assembled nitrogen functionalized transition metal and nitrogen doped graphene pyrolyzed materials has been conducted in this study. First principle density\u2010functional\u2010theory calculations were performed to assess the thermochemistry of Fe\u2013Nx and graphitic\u2010N defects and to predict N1s core\u2010level\u2010shifts. Combining this prediction with our X\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy and rotating ring disk electrode experiments, we find that graphitic\u2010N contributes significantly to hydrogen peroxide formation in oxygen reduction reactions, while materials containing nitrogen coordinated transition metal result in the complete reduction of oxygen to water. Lastly, we show how the synergy of experimental, electrochemical, and computational approaches can accelerate the accurate \u2026"
