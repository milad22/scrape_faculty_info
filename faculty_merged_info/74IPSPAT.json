                "We present cosmological parameters derived from the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed at 148 GHz and 218 GHz over 296 deg 2 with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) during its 2008 season. ACT measures fluctuations at scales 500< \u2113< 10, 000. We fit a model for the lensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz and 218 GHz power spectra, including thermal and kinetic SZ, Poisson power from radio and infrared point sources, and clustered power from infrared point sources. At \u2113= 3000, about half the power at 148 GHz comes from primary CMB after masking bright radio sources. The power from thermal and kinetic SZ is estimated to be , where . The IR Poisson power at 148 GHz is (C \u2113= 5.5\u00b10.5 nK 2), and a clustered IR component is required with \u2026",
                "We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey on the celestial equator. With this addition, the ACT collaboration has reported a total of 91 optically confirmed, SZ detected clusters. The 504 square degree survey region includes 270 square degrees of overlap with SDSS Stripe 82, permitting the confirmation of SZ cluster candidates in deep archival optical data. The subsample of 48 clusters within Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90% complete for M 500c> 4.5\u00d7 10 14 M\u2299 and redshifts 0.15< z< 0.8. While a full suite of matched filters is used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a''Profile Based Amplitude Analysis''using a statistic derived from a single filter at a fixed \u03b8 500= 5 farcm 9 angular scale. This new approach incorporates the cluster redshift along with \u2026"

My research involves the development and application of numerical simulations to model and interpret the observable University. In cosmology, I work on complex problems involving the gas, stars, galaxies, quasars, and clusters of galaxies that provide information about the underlying dark matter and dark energy. In astrophysics, I am interested in the dynamics of stellar systems and the mergers of compact objects that produce gravitational waves. I also collaborate with computer scientists and statisticians to apply modern AI\/ML approaches to improve multi-wavelength data analysis and numerical simulations. For example, we are applying Bayesian Deep Learning to map the dark matter in galaxy clusters. I am a member of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Simons Observatory (SO) Collaborations.
