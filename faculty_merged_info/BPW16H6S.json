                "We report on the first measurement of spin-correlation parameters in quasifree electron scattering from vector-polarized deuterium. Polarized electrons were injected into an electron storage ring at a beam energy of 720 MeV. A Siberian snake was employed to preserve longitudinal polarization at the interaction point. Vector-polarized deuterium was produced by an atomic beam source and injected into an open-ended cylindrical cell, internal to the electron storage ring. The spin correlation parameter A ed V was measured for the reaction 2 H\u2192(e\u2192, e\u2032 n) p at a four-momentum transfer squared of 0.21 (GeV\/c) 2 from which a value for the charge form factor of the neutron was extracted.",
                "High-precision 1 H (e, e\u2032 p) \u03c0 0 measurements at Q 2= 0.126 (GeV\/c) 2 are reported, which allow the determination of quadrupole amplitudes in the \u03b3* N\u2192 \u0394 transition; they simultaneously test the reliability of electroproduction models. The derived quadrupole-to-dipole (I= 3\/2) amplitude ratios, R SM=(\u2212 6.5\u00b10.2 stat+ sys\u00b12.5 mod)% and R EM=(\u2212 2.1\u00b10.2 stat+ sys\u00b12.0 mod)%, are dominated by model error. Previous R SM and R EM results should be reconsidered after the model uncertainties associated with the method of their extraction are taken into account.",
                "We report the first precision measurement of the proton electric to magnetic form factor ratio from spin-dependent elastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from a polarized hydrogen internal gas target. The measurement was performed at the MIT-Bates South Hall Ring over a range of four-momentum transfer squared Q 2 from 0.15 to 0.65 (GeV\/c) 2. Significantly improved results on the proton electric and magnetic form factors are obtained in combination with existing cross-section data on elastic electron-proton scattering in the same Q 2 region.",
                "We report an absolute measurement of the tensor analyzing powers T 20 and T 22 in elastic electron-deuteron scattering at a momentum transfer of 1.6 fm\u2212 1. The novel approach of this measurement is the use of a tensor polarized 2 H target internal to an electron storage ring, with in situ measurement of the polarization of the target gas. Scattered electrons and recoil deuterons were detected in coincidence with two large acceptance nonmagnetic detectors. The techniques demonstrated have broad applicability to further measurements of spin-dependent electron scattering.",
                "We report new precise H (e, e\u2032 p) \u03c0 0 measurements at the \u0394 (1232) resonance at Q 2= 0.127 (G e V\/c) 2 obtained at the MIT-Bates out-of-plane scattering facility which are particularly sensitive to the transverse electric amplitude (E 2) of the \u03b3* N\u2192 \u0394 transition. The new data have been analyzed together with those of earlier measurements to yield precise quadrupole to dipole amplitude ratios: R e (E 1+ 3\/2\/M 1+ 3\/2)=(\u2212 2.3\u00b10.3 s t a t+ s y s t\u00b10.6 m o d e l)% and R e (S 1+ 3\/2\/M 1+ 3\/2)=(\u2212 6.1\u00b10.2 s t a t+ s y s t\u00b10.5 m o d e l)% for M 1+ 3\/2=(41.4\u00b10.3 s t a t+ s y s t\u00b10.4 m o d e l)(10\u2212 3\/m \u03c0+). The derived amplitudes give credence to the conjecture of deformation in hadrons favoring, at low Q 2, the dominance of mesonic effects.",
                "We report on a measurement of the tensor analyzing power T 20 in elastic electron-deuteron scattering in the range of four-momentum transfer from 1.8 to 3.2 fm\u2212 1. Electrons of 704 MeV were scattered from a polarized deuterium internal target. The tensor polarization of the deuterium nuclei was determined with an ion-extraction system, allowing an absolute measurement of T 20. The data are described well by a nonrelativistic calculation that includes the effects of meson-exchange currents.",
                "The distribution of M 1 strength in Pb 208 has been measured between 5.8 and 7.4 MeV with highly polarized tagged photons. \u03a3 \u0393 0 2 (M 1) \u0393= 14.6\u2212 1.3+ 1.5 eV corresponding to \u03a3 B (M 1\u2191)=(10.7\u2212 0.9+ 1.1) \u03bc N 2 was found, and can fully account for the much discussed\" missing\" M 1 in Pb 208. When the present result is combined with known 1+ transitions above neutron threshold, an M 1 giant resonance emerges at 7.3 MeV, 1 MeV wide, with \u03a3 B (M 1\u2191)\u2248 15.6 \u03bc N 2. Smaller 1+ resonances are also seen at both 5.85 and 6.24 MeV. The total M 1 strength below 6.4 MeV amounts to \u03a3 B (M 1)=(1.9\u2212 0.4+ 0.7) \u03bc N 2.",
                "We report new measurements of the neutron charge form factor at low momentum transfer using quasielastic electrodisintegration of the deuteron. Longitudinally polarized electrons at an energy of 850 MeV were scattered from an isotopically pure, highly polarized deuterium gas target. The scattered electrons and coincident neutrons were measured by the Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST) detector. The neutron form factor ratio G E n\/G M n was extracted from the beam-target vector asymmetry A ed V at four-momentum transfers Q 2= 0.14, 0.20, 0.29, and 0.42 (GeV\/c) 2.",
                "The OLYMPUS Collaboration reports on a precision measurement of the positron-proton to electron-proton elastic cross section ratio, R 2 \u03b3, a direct measure of the contribution of hard two-photon exchange to the elastic cross section. In the OLYMPUS measurement, 2.01 GeV electron and positron beams were directed through a hydrogen gas target internal to the DORIS storage ring at DESY. A toroidal magnetic spectrometer instrumented with drift chambers and time-of-flight scintillators detected elastically scattered leptons in coincidence with recoiling protons over a scattering angle range of\u2248 20 to 80. The relative luminosity between the two beam species was monitored using tracking telescopes of interleaved gas electron multiplier and multiwire proportional chamber detectors at 12, as well as symmetric M\u00f8ller or Bhabha calorimeters at 1.29. A total integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb\u2212 1 was collected. In the \u2026"
