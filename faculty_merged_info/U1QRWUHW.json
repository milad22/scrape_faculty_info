                "Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon the local spin density (LSD) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential.",
                "Popular modern generalized gradient approximations are biased toward the description of free-atom energies. Restoration of the first-principles gradient expansion for exchange over a wide range of density gradients eliminates this bias. We introduce a revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation that improves equilibrium properties of densely packed solids and their surfaces.",

Our GGA hole recovers the Perdew-Wang 1991 and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof GGA\u2019s for the exchange-correlation energy, which therefore respect the same powerful hole constraints as LSD.

                "Density functional approximations for the exchange\u2010correlation energy EDFAxc of an electronic system are often improved by admixing some exact exchange Ex: Exc\u224aEDFAxc+(1\/n)(Ex\u2212EDFAx). This procedure is justified when the error in EDFAxc arises from the \u03bb=0 or exchange end of the coupling\u2010constant integral \u222b10 d\u03bb\u2009EDFAxc,\u03bb. We argue that the optimum integer n is approximately the lowest order of G\u00f6rling\u2013Levy perturbation theory which provides a realistic description of the coupling\u2010constant dependence Exc,\u03bb in the range 0\u2264\u03bb\u22641, whence n\u224a4 for atomization energies of typical molecules. We also propose a continuous generalization of n as an index of correlation strength, and a possible mixing of second\u2010order perturbation theory with the generalized gradient approximation.",
                "Density functional theory (DFT) is an incredible success story. The low computational cost, combined with useful (but not yet chemical) accuracy, has made DFT a standard technique in most branches of chemistry and materials science. Electronic structure problems in a dazzling variety of fields are currently being tackled. However, DFT has many limitations in its present form: too many approximations, failures for strongly correlated systems, too slow for liquids, etc. This perspective reviews some recent progress and ongoing challenges.",
                "Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is presently enjoying enormous popularity in quantum chemistry, as a useful tool for extracting electronic excited state energies. This article discusses how TDDFT is much broader in scope, and yields predictions for many more properties. We discuss some of the challenges involved in making accurate predictions for these properties.",
                "The year 2004 was a remarkable one for the growing? eld of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Not only did we celebrate the 40th-niversary of the Hohenberg-Kohn paper, which had laid the foundation for ground-state density functional theory (DFT), but it was also the 20th-niversary of the work by Runge and Gross, establishing a? rm footing for the time-dependent theory. Because the? eld has grown to such prominence, and has spread to so many areas of science (from materials to biochemistry), we feel that a volume dedicated to TDDFT is most timely. TDDFT is based on a set of ideas and theorems quite distinct from those governingground-stateDFT, butemployingsimilar techniques. Itisfarmore than just applying ground-state DFT to time-dependent problems, as it-volves its own exact theorems and new and di? erent density functionals. Presently, themostpopularapplicationistheextractionofelectronicexcit-state properties, especially transition frequencies. By applying TDDFT after thegroundstateofamoleculehasbeenfound, wecanexploreandunderstand the complexity of its spectrum, thus providing much more information about the species. TDDFT has a especially strong impact in the photochemistry of biological molecules, where the molecules are too large to be handled by t-ditional quantum chemical methods, and are too complex to be understood with simple empirical frontier orbital theory.",
                "Ref.[1] was to present a simple, nonempirical derivation of a simplified generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy of density functional theory. Among the many conditions that might have been imposed to construct the functional, we selected as most appropriate to the GGA form those already satisfied by the local spin density (LSD) approximation, or by the numerical GGA derived from sum rules on the exchangecorrelation hole [2].One of the conditions already satisfied by LSD is the Lieb-Oxford bound [3]. By satisfying this bound locally (and only by so doing), we ensure that our GGA will satisfy the integrated bound for any possible electron density, as LSD does. The resulting GGA Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) is remarkably like the more complicated Perdew-Wang 1991 GGA derived from the sum rules. Simple physical arguments [4] explain its characteristic dependencies \u2026",
                "Within the adiabatic approximation, time-dependent density functional theory yields only single excitations. Near states of double excitation character, the exact exchange\u2013correlation kernel has a strong dependence on frequency. We derive the exact frequency-dependent kernel when a double excitation mixes with a single excitation, well separated from the other excitations, in the limit that the electron\u2013electron interaction is weak. Building on this, we construct a nonempirical approximation for the general case, and illustrate our results on a simple model."

Density functional theory is a way of solving the equations\u00a0of quantum mechanics for the electrons in any substance.\u00a0Because DFT equations can be solved relatively quickly on\u00a0modern computers,\u00a0DFT has become a very popular tool in\u00a0many branches of science, especially chemistry and materials\u00a0science.\u00a0 Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used DFT.\u00a0For example, hydrogen sulphide was predicted by DFT calculations to\u00a0have a high superconducting temperature under pressure, and\u00a0a year later, it was tested and became the world-record holder,\u00a0at 203K. Professor Burke works on developing all aspects of DFT: formalism,\u00a0extensions to new areas, new approximations, and simplifications.\u00a0His work is heavily used in materials science, chemistry, matter\u00a0under extreme conditions (such as planetary interiors or fusion\u00a0reactors), magnetic materials, molecular electronics, and so on.\u00a0He has given talks in theoretical chemistry, condensed matter\u00a0physics, applied mathematics, and even organic chemistry.\u00a0His graduate students and postdocs usually come from either the\u00a0chemistry or physics departments, but his undergraduate researchers\u00a0also come from math, computer science, and engineering.\u00a0 He also runs\u00a0an internship program for motivated high-school students. Professor\u00a0Burke believes that the most impactful advance in 20th century\u00a0physics was the development of quantum mechanics, without which we cannot\u00a0understand chemistry and materials.\u00a0He also believes that there are few problems in theoretical\u00a0science whose solution has more immediate impact than the improvement of DFT.\u00a0The more accurate, reliable, and widespread DFT calculations\u00a0become, the sooner we will have novel materials and drugs, and\u00a0the more we will understand both our own planet and others. Kieron Burke is a Chancellor's Professor of UCI, and a fellow of the\u00a0American Physical Society.\u00a0 He is known around the world\u00a0for his many educational and\u00a0outreach activities.\u00a0 Most recently,\u00a0he was honored to participate in the Baker symposium\u00a0at Cornell in 2016. According to google scholar, his research papers are now cited more than 11,000 times\u00a0each year. UCI Faculty Profile Marie Tonini, mtonini@uci.edu, 949-824-0475"
