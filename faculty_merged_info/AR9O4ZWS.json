                "Some consequences of an SO (10) gauge theory which breaks down to SU (3) c\u00d7 U (1) em via SU (4) c\u00d7 SU (2) L\u00d7 SU (2) R are presented. These include:(i) A proton lifetime estimate of (1\u201320)\u00d7 10 31 yr.(ii) Mass relations involving quarks and charged leptons. The explanation of the violation of the asymptotic SU (5) relation m e= m d is linked to the new intermediate mass scale in SO (10). The top quark mass is estimated to be 20\u00b12 GeV at the toponium mass.(iii) The possibility of a fourth generation (\u03bd \u03c4\u2032, \u03c4\u2032, b\u2032, t\u2032) with m \u03c4\u2032\u2245 17\u201335 GeV, m b\u2032\u22cd 42\u2013118 GeV and m t\u2032\u22cd 150\u2013230 GeV.(iv) Heaviest neutrino mass in the 1\u201310 eV range. In addition, the masses of the superheavy neutrinos are of order 5\u00d7 10 12\u2212 5\u00d7 10 13 GeV.(v) Neutron-antineutron oscillations with \u03c4 n n> 10 38 yr.",
                "We present a novel inflationary scenario in theories with low scale (TeV) quantum gravity, in which the standard model particles are localized on the branes whereas gravity propagates in the bulk of large extra dimensions. This inflationary scenario is natural in the brane world picture. In the lowest energy state, a number of branes sit on top of each other (or at an orientifold plane), so the vacuum energy cancels out. In the cosmological setting, some of the branes \u201cstart out\u201d relatively displaced in the extra dimensions and the resulting vacuum energy triggers the exponential growth of the 3 non-compact dimensions. The number of e-foldings can be very large due to the very weak brane-brane interaction at large distances. In the effective four-dimensional field theory, the brane motion is described by a slowly rolling scalar field with an extremely flat plateau potential.
