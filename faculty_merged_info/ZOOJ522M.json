                "The first chordates appear in the fossil record at the time of the Cambrian explosion, nearly 550 million years ago. The modern ascidian tadpole represents a plausible approximation to these ancestral chordates. To illuminate the origins of chordate and vertebrates, we generated a draft of the protein-coding portion of the genome of the most studied ascidian, Ciona intestinalis. TheCiona genome contains \u223c16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates. Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development. The ascidian genome has also acquired a number of lineage-specific innovations, including a group of genes engaged in cellulose metabolism that are related to those in bacteria and fungi.",
                "Two-dimensional nanosheets have attracted tremendous attention because of their promising practical application and theoretical values. The atomic-thick nanosheets are able to not only enhance the intrinsic properties of their bulk counterparts but also give birth to new promising properties. Herein, we highlight an available pathway to prepare the ultrathin graphitic-phase C3N4 (g-C3N4) nanosheets by a \u201cgreen\u201d liquid exfoliation route from bulk g-C3N4 in water for the first time. The as-obtained ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet solution is very stable in both the acidic and alkaline environment and shows pH-dependent photoluminenscence (PL). Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets show enhanced intrinsic photoabsorption and photoresponse, which induce their extremely high PL quantum yield up to 19.6%. Thus, benefiting from the inherent blue light PL with high quantum yields and high \u2026",
                "Electrochemical water splitting is a clean technology for H2 fuels, but greatly hindered by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a series of spinel\u2010structured nanosheets with oxygen deficiencies and ultrathin thicknesses were designed to increase the reactivity and the number of active sites of the catalysts, which were then taken as an excellent platform for promoting the water oxidation process. Theoretical investigations showed that the oxygen vacancies confined in the ultrathin nanosheet could lower the adsorption energy of H2O, leading to increased OER efficiency. As expected, the NiCo2O4 ultrathin nanosheets rich in oxygen vacancies exhibited a large current density of 285\u2005mA\u2009cm\u22122 at 0.8\u2005V and a small overpotential of 0.32\u2005V, both of which are superior to the corresponding values of bulk samples or samples with few oxygen deficiencies and even higher than those of most \u2026",
                "Cellulose, the most abundant source of biomass, is currently regarded as a promising alternative for fossil fuels as it cannot be digested by human beings and thus its use, unlike corn and starch, will not impose a negative impact on food supplies.[1, 2] One of the most attractive routes for the reaction of cellulose utilization is its direct conversion into useful organic compounds.[3] A recent example of the catalytic conversion of cellulose has been demonstrated by Fukuoka and Dhepe, who utilized Pt\/Al2O3 as an effective catalyst to convert cellulose into sugar alcohols [4](Scheme 1, Route A). The product sugar alcohols can be used as chemicals in their own right or as new starting materials for the production of fuels, as demonstrated by Dumesic and co-workers.[5, 6] Recently, Luo et al. have studied this process further.[7] In their work, the reaction was conducted at elevated temperatures so that water could generate \u2026",
                "A greyscale-based fully automatic deformable image registration algorithm, originally known as the'demons' algorithm, was implemented for CT image-guided radiotherapy. We accelerated the algorithm by introducing an'active force'along with an adaptive force strength adjustment during the iterative process. These improvements led to a 40% speed improvement over the original algorithm and a high tolerance of large organ deformations. We used three methods to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. First, we created a set of mathematical transformations for a series of patient's CT images. This provides a'ground truth'solution for quantitatively validating the deformable image registration algorithm. Second, we used a physically deformable pelvic phantom, which can measure deformed objects under different conditions. The results of these two tests allowed us to quantify the accuracy of the deformable \u2026",
                "Many patients receiving fractionated radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer have marked anatomic changes during their course of treatment, including shrinking of the primary tumor or nodal masses, resolving postoperative changes\/edema, and changes in overall body habitus\/weight loss. We conducted a pilot study to quantify the magnitude of these anatomic changes with systematic CT imaging.Fourteen assessable patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Eligible patients had to have a pathologic diagnosis of head-and-neck cancer, be treated with definitive external beam RT, and had have gross primary and\/or cervical nodal disease measuring at least 4 cm in maximal diameter. All patients were treated using a new commercial integrated CT-linear accelerator system (EXaCT) that allows CT imaging at the daily RT sessions while the patient remains immobilized in the \u2026",
                "Titanium dioxide is frequently used in the production of paints, paper, plastics, welding rod-coating material, and cosmetics, because of its low toxicity. However, recent studies have shown that nano-sized or ultrafine TiO2 (UF-TiO2) (<100 nm in diameter) can generate pulmonary fibrosis and lung tumor in rats. Cytotoxicity induced by UF-TiO2 in rat lung alveolar macrophages was also observed. This generates great concern about the possible adverse effects of UF-TiO2 for humans. The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of UF-TiO2 were investigated using the methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (MTT) assay, the population growth assay, the apoptosis assay by flow cytometry, the cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, the comet assay, and the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene mutation assay. WIL2-NS cells were incubated for 6, 24 and 48 h with 0, 26, 65 and 130 \u03bcg\/ml UF-TiO2 \u2026",
                "Limited information is available on the environmental behavior and associated potential risk of manufactured oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In this research, toxicity of nanoparticulate and bulk ZnO, Al2O3 and TiO2 were examined to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with Escherichia coli as a food source. Parallel experiments with dissolved metal ions from NPs were also conducted. The 24-h median lethal concentration (LC50) and sublethal endpoints were assessed. Both NPs and their bulk counterparts were toxic, inhibiting growth and especially the reproductive capability of the nematode. The 24-h LC50 for ZnO NPs (2.3 mg L\u22121) and bulk ZnO was not significantly different, but significantly different between Al2O3 NPs (82 mg L\u22121) and bulk Al2O3 (153 mg L\u22121), and between TiO2 NPs (80 mg L\u22121) and bulk TiO2 (136 mg L\u22121). Oxide solubility influenced the toxicity of ZnO and Al2O3 NPs, but nanoparticle \u2026",
                "\u2014Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulator of angiogenesis that stimulates proliferation, migration, and proteolytic activity of endothelial cells. Although the mitogenic activity of VEGF is endothelial cell specific, recent reports indicate VEGF is able to stimulate chemotaxis and tissue factor production in monocytes. VEGF-stimulated activity in monocytes is mediated by the VEGF receptor flt-1. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of VEGF on another major cell type in the vascular wall, namely, the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC). Using cultured cells, we showed that VEGF has a minimal mitogenic effect on SMCs, which is in accordance with published data. However, VEGF treatment significantly enhanced production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, and -9 by human SMCs. The upregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-9 was pronounced, and the stimulation for MMP \u2026",
                "Alternative RNA splicing greatly increases proteome diversity and may thereby contribute to tissue-specific functions. We carried out genome-wide quantitative analysis of alternative splicing using a custom Affymetrix microarray to assess the role of the neuronal splicing factor Nova in the brain. We used a stringent algorithm to identify 591 exons that were differentially spliced in the brain relative to immune tissues, and 6.6% of these showed major splicing defects in the neocortex of Nova2\u2212\/\u2212 mice. We tested 49 exons with the largest predicted Nova-dependent splicing changes and validated all 49 by RT-PCR. We analyzed the encoded proteins and found that all those with defined brain functions acted in the synapse (34 of 40, including neurotransmitter receptors, cation channels, adhesion and scaffold proteins) or in axon guidance (8 of 40). Moreover, of the 35 proteins with known interaction partners, 74%(26 \u2026"
