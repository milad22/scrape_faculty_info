                "Nano-sizing offers a promising method for the formulation of poorly aqueous soluble compounds. Nanosuspensions can be prepared by top-down or bottom-up approaches. The different conditions encountered in these two approaches can greatly affect nanosuspension characteristics. In this study, milling via microfluidization and precipitation via sonication were compared to study their effects on the formation and stability of ibuprofen nanosuspensions. Various stabilizers (SLS, PVP K-30, Pluronic F-68 and F-127, Tween 80 and different hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses (HPMCs)) were evaluated. Both processes resulted in a similar trend in the initial particle size and comparable short-term physical stability of suspensions. Of all the stabilizers investigated, the HPMCs were the most effective both in terms of particle size reduction and short-term physical stability. Differences in stabilizer efficacy were observed \u2026"

Our primary goals are to further enhance their reliability and extend their applicability to systems that function through increasingly more complex interactions. Specifically, we are (a) enhancing the reliability of molecular mechanics based methods toward modeling biomolecular ionic interactions, and (b) developing new machine learning inspired methods to describe proteins regulated by dynamic allostery. We also utilize simulations, mostly in collaboration with experimental groups, to address key unresolved biophysical questions in membrane structure, transmembrane ion transport, allosteric signaling and protein-protein interactions.
