                "Dr. Lingze Duan Dr. Lingze Duan Professor, Dr. Lingze Duan received the B.S. degree in physics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 1995 and the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA in 2002. After conducting postdoctoral research at MIT (2002-2004) and Penn State (2004-2007), he joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UAH as a faculty member in 2007, where he has been an Associate Professor since 2013. His current research interest includes ultrafast nanophotonics, frequency metrology with femtosecond frequency combs, fiber optic sensors, and novel applications of optics in astrophysics. He was a recipient of the National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award in 2013. He is a Senior Member of the Optical Society (OSA) and a Senior Member of IEEE and IEEE Photonics Society. Dr. Duan's teaching interest covers a broad range of subjects in physics and optics, including general physics (PH 112, 115 and 310), basic optics (OPT 341, 342, 411, 412 and 441), and advanced optical & laser sciences (PH\/OSE 632, 645, 733 and 745).
