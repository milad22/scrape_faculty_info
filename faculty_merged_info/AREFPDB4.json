                "In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect the copy-move forgery in an image, mainly by extracting the keypoints for comparison. The main difference to the traditional methods is that the proposed scheme first segments the test image into semantically independent patches prior to keypoint extraction. As a result, the copy-move regions can be detected by matching between these patches. The matching process consists of two stages. In the first stage, we find the suspicious pairs of patches that may contain copy-move forgery regions, and we roughly estimate an affine transform matrix. In the second stage, an Expectation-Maximization-based algorithm is designed to refine the estimated matrix and to confirm the existence of copy-move forgery. Experimental results prove the good performance of the proposed scheme via comparing it with the state-of-the-art schemes on the public databases.",
                "Prediction-error expansion (PEE) is an important technique of reversible watermarking which can embed large payloads into digital images with low distortion. In this paper, the PEE technique is further investigated and an efficient reversible watermarking scheme is proposed, by incorporating in PEE two new strategies, namely, adaptive embedding and pixel selection. Unlike conventional PEE which embeds data uniformly, we propose to adaptively embed 1 or 2 bits into expandable pixel according to the local complexity. This avoids expanding pixels with large prediction-errors, and thus, it reduces embedding impact by decreasing the maximum modification to pixel values. Meanwhile, adaptive PEE allows very large payload in a single embedding pass, and it improves the capacity limit of conventional PEE. We also propose to select pixels of smooth area for data embedding and leave rough pixels unchanged \u2026",
                "In prediction-error expansion (PEE) based reversible data hiding, better exploiting image redundancy usually leads to a superior performance. However, the correlations among prediction-errors are not considered and utilized in current PEE based methods. Specifically, in PEE, the prediction-errors are modified individually in data embedding. In this paper, to better exploit these correlations, instead of utilizing prediction-errors individually, we propose to consider every two adjacent prediction-errors jointly to generate a sequence consisting of prediction-error pairs. Then, based on the sequence and the resulting 2D prediction-error histogram, a more efficient embedding strategy, namely, pairwise PEE, can be designed to achieve an improved performance. The superiority of our method is verified through extensive experiments.",
                "Histogram shifting (HS) is a useful technique of reversible data hiding (RDH). With HS-based RDH, high capacity and low distortion can be achieved efficiently. In this paper, we revisit the HS technique and present a general framework to construct HS-based RDH. By the proposed framework, one can get a RDH algorithm by simply designing the so-called shifting and embedding functions. Moreover, by taking specific shifting and embedding functions, we show that several RDH algorithms reported in the literature are special cases of this general construction. In addition, two novel and efficient RDH algorithms are also introduced to further demonstrate the universality and applicability of our framework. It is expected that more efficient RDH algorithms can be devised according to the proposed framework by carefully designing the shifting and embedding functions.",
                "A well defined cost function is crucial to steganography under the scenario of minimizing embedding distortion. In this paper, we present a new cost function for spatial image steganography. The proposed cost function is designed by using a high-pass filter to locate the less predictable parts in an image, and then using two low-pass filters to make the low cost values more clustered. Experiments show that the steganographic method with the proposed cost function makes the embedding changes more concentrated in texture regions, and thus achieves a better performance on resisting the state-of-the-art steganalysis over prior works, including HUGO, WOW, and S-UNIWARD.",
                "This paper presents a high-fidelity reversible data hiding scheme for digital images based on a new prediction strategy called pixel-value-ordering (PVO) and the well-known prediction-error expansion (PEE) technique. Specifically, a host image is first divided into non-overlapped equal-sized blocks. Then the maximum and minimum values of each block are predicted by other pixels of the block according to their pixel value orders. With such a PVO-based predictor, data embedding is implemented via PEE. The incorporation of PVO into PEE has an advantage in reducing the number of shifted pixels, and thus it can alleviate the degradation in image quality. Consequently, the proposed method can embed adequate data into a host image with rather limited distortion. The PSNR of a marked image versus its original one is guaranteed to be above 51.14 dB. In addition, a solution is provided to further improve the \u2026",
                "In this paper, based on two-dimensional difference- histogram modification, a novel reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme is proposed by using difference-pair-mapping (DPM). First, by considering each pixel-pair and its context, a sequence consisting of pairs of difference values is computed. Then, a two-dimensional difference-histogram is generated by counting the frequency of the resulting difference-pairs. Finally, reversible data embedding is implemented according to a specifically designed DPM. Here, the DPM is an injective mapping defined on difference-pairs. It is a natural extension of expansion embedding and shifting techniques used in current histogram-based RDH methods. By the proposed approach, compared with the conventional one-dimensional difference-histogram and one-dimensional prediction-error-histogram-based RDH methods, the image redundancy can be better exploited and an \u2026",
                "In the past two decades, reversible data hiding (RDH), also referred to as lossless or invertible data hiding, has gradually become a very active research area in the field of data hiding. This has been verified by more and more papers on increasingly wide-spread subjects in the field of RDH research that have been published these days. In this paper, the various RDH algorithms and researches have been classified into the following six categories: 1) RDH into image spatial domain; 2) RDH into image compressed domain (e.g., JPEG); 3) RDH suitable for image semi-fragile authentication; 4) RDH with image contrast enhancement; 5) RDH into encrypted images, which is expected to have wide application in the cloud computation; and 6) RDH into video and into audio. For each of these six categories, the history of technical developments, the current state of the arts, and the possible future researches are presented \u2026",
                "In this paper, we present a new reversible data hiding algorithm based on integer transform and adaptive embedding. According to the image block type determined by the pre-estimated distortion, the parameter in integer transform is adaptively selected in different blocks. This allows embedding more data bits into smooth blocks while avoiding large distortion generated by noisy ones, and thus enables very high capacity with good image quality. For instance, by the proposed method, we can embed as high as 2.17 bits per pixel into Lena image with a reasonable PSNR of 20.71 dB. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms, especially for high capacity case.",
                "Prediction-error expansion (PEE) is the most successful reversible data hiding (RDH) technique, and existing PEE-based RDH methods are mainly based on the modification of one- or two-dimensional prediction-error histogram (PEH). The two-dimensional PEH-based methods perform generally better than those based on one-dimensional PEH; however, their performance is still unsatisfactory since the PEH modification manner is fixed and independent of image content. In this paper, we propose a new RDH method based on PEE for multiple histograms. Unlike the previous methods, we consider in this paper a sequence of histograms and devise a new embedding mechanism based on multiple histograms modification (MHM). A complexity measurement is computed for each pixel according to its context, and the pixels with a given complexity are collected together to generate a PEH. By varying the complexity \u2026"
