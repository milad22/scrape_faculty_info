                "Brian Batell 401 Allen Hall (412) 624-7565 batell@pitt.edu My research is in the area of theoretical particle physics, with a focus on physics beyond the Standard Model. While the Standard Model provides a remarkably successful description of elementary matter and forces, it fails to address a number of outstanding conceptual and empirical mysteries, such as the naturalness of electroweak symmetry breaking, the strong CP problem, the nature of dark matter, and the origin of neutrino masses. I aim to address these problems by proposing new theoretical frameworks, confronting motivated models with new data, and devising novel experimental and observational strategies to test the Standard Model and search for new phenomena.
