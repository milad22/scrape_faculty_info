                "Gallium nitride (GaN) is a compound semiconductor that has tremendous potential to facilitate economic growth in a semiconductor industry that is silicon-based and currently faced with diminishing returns of performance versus cost of investment. At a material level, its high electric field strength and electron mobility have already shown tremendous potential for high frequency communications and photonic applications. Advances in growth on commercially viable large area substrates are now at the point where power conversion applications of GaN are at the cusp of commercialisation. The future for building on the work described here in ways driven by specific challenges emerging from entirely new markets and applications is very exciting. This collection of GaN technology developments is therefore not itself a road map but a valuable collection of global state-of-the-art GaN research that will inform the next \u2026",
                "Impurity\u2010free selective layer disordering, utilizing Si3N4 masking stripes and SiO2 defect (vacancy) sources, is used to realize room\u2010temperature continuous AlxGa1\u2212xAs\u2010GaAs quantum well heterostructure lasers.",
                "The effects of background doping, surface encapsulation, and As4 overpressure on carbon diffusion have been studied by annealing samples with 1000 \u00c5 p\u2010type carbon doping spikes grown within 1 \u03bcm layers of undoped (n\u2212), Se\u2010doped (n+), and Mg\u2010doped (p+) GaAs. The layers were grown by low\u2010pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition using CCl4 as the carbon doping source. Two different As4 overpressure conditions were investigated: (1) the equilibrium pAs4 over GaAs (no excess As), and (2) pAs4 \u223c2.5 atm. For each As4 overpressure condition, both capless and Si3N4\u2010capped samples of the n\u2212\u2010, n+\u2010, and p+\u2010GaAs crystals were annealed simultaneously (825\u2009\u00b0C, 24 h). Secondary\u2010ion mass spectroscopy was used to measure the atomic carbon depth profiles. The carbon diffusion coefficient is always low, but depends on the background doping, being highest in Mg\u2010doped (p+) GaAs and \u2026",
                "Data are presented showing that the Al\u2010Ga interdiffusion coefficient (DAl\u2010Ga) for an AlxGa1\u2212xAs\u2010GaAs quantum\u2010well heterostructure, or a superlattice, is highly dependent upon the crystal encapsulation conditions. The activation energy for Al\u2010Ga interdiffusion, and thus layer disordering, is smaller for dielectric\u2010encapsulated samples (\u223c3.5 eV) than for the case of capless annealing (\u223c4.7 eV). The interdiffusion coefficient for Si3N4\u2010capped samples is almost an order of magnitude smaller than for the case of either capless or SiO2\u2010capped samples (800\u2264T\u2264875\u2009\u00b0C). Besides the major influence of the type of encapsulant, the encapsulation geometry (stripes or capped stripes) is shown, because of strain effects, to be a major source of anisotropic Al\u2010Ga interdiffusion.",
                "We report on a SiO\/sub 2\/\/Si\/sub 3\/N\/sub 4\/\/SiO\/sub 2\/ (ONO) gate insulator stack deposited on GaN by jet vapor deposition (JVD) technique. Capacitors fabricated using the JVD-ONO on GaN are characterized from room temperature to 450\/spl deg\/C using capacitance-voltage (C-V), current-voltage (I-V), AC conductance, and constant-current stress measurements. We find excellent operating characteristics over the measured range, most notably: (1) very low leakage current, (2) extremely high hard-breakdown strength, (3) low interface-trap density, and (4) low net dielectric-charge density. Moreover these performance figures remain well within acceptable limits even for operating temperatures as high as 150\/spl deg\/C. In addition, we measure both the capture cross-section of the interface traps and the surface-potential fluctuation at the GaN\/ONO interface. All results suggest that JVD-ONO is an excellent choice \u2026",
