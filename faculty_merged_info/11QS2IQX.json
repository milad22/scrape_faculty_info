                "Theodora Karalidi Assistant Professor PSB 104 tkaralidi@ucf.edu Dr Karalidi received her PhD from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Her work focuses on modeling the spectropolarimetric signal of exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres. Dr Karalidi is also working on mapping exoatmospheres using observational light curves. She spent 4 years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, and 1.5 years at the University of California Santa Cruz before joining UCF as an Assistant Professor in 2019. She was part of the team that first reported the existence of banded cloud structures on brown dwarf atmospheres, a result which was published in Science in August 2017.
