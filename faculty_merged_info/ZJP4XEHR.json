                "Chanda  Prescod-Weinstein Assistant Professor, Department of Physics Core Faculty, Women's Studies Professor Prescod-Weinstein's research focuses on theoretical work\u00a0at the intersection of particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. She is interested in scalar dark matter candidates such as axions and axion-like particles, as well as neutron stars and inflationary cosmology. She is a member of the LSST Dark Matter Group and the STROBE-X Science Working Group , where she leads Team STROBE-Ax. Before coming to the University of New Hampshire, she held a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellowship at Goddard Space Flight Center, a Martin Luther King Postdoctoral Fellowship in Physics at MIT, and was a research associate at the University of Washington.
