                "We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P (k) from over 200 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other data. Our results are consistent with a \u201cvanilla\u201d flat adiabatic cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant without tilt (n s= 1), running tilt, tensor modes, or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 \u03c3 constraints on the Hubble parameter from h\u2248 0.74\u2212 0.07+ 0.18 to h\u2248 0.70\u2212 0.03+ 0.04, on the matter density from \u03a9 m\u2248 0.25\u00b10.10 to \u03a9 m\u2248 0.30\u00b10.04 (1 \u03c3) and on neutrino masses from< 11 to< 0.6 eV (95%). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis \u2026",
                "Modern Cosmology begins with an introduction to the smooth, homogeneous universe described by a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, including careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis, recombination, and dark matter. From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and weak lensing. The book concludes with a long chapter on data analysis. Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E\/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe. Provides foundations, calculations, and interpretations which illuminate current thinking in cosmology Covers the major advances in cosmology over the past decade Includes over 100 unique, pedagogical figures",
                "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover approximately one-quarter of the celestial sphere and collect spectra of\u2248 10 6 galaxies, 100,000 quasars, 30,000 stars, and 30,000 serendipity targets. In 2001 June, the SDSS released to the general astronomical community its early data release, roughly 462 deg 2 of imaging data including almost 14 million detected objects and 54,008 follow-up spectra. The imaging data were collected in drift-scan mode in five bandpasses (u, g, r, i, and z); our 95% completeness limits for stars are 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, respectively. The photometric calibration is reproducible to 5%, 3%, 3%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. The spectra are flux-and wavelength-calibrated, with 4096 pixels from 3800 to 9200 \u00c5 at R\u2248 1800. We present the means by which these data are distributed to the astronomical community \u2026",
                "The simplest model that can accommodate a viable nonbaryonic dark matter candidate is the standard electroweak theory with the addition of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. We consider a single generation of neutrinos with a Dirac mass \u03bc and a Majorana mass M for the right-handed component. If M\u226b \u03bc (standard hot dark matter corresponds to M= 0), then sterile neutrinos are produced via oscillations in the early Universe with energy density independent of M. However, M is crucial in determining the large scale structure of the Universe; for M\u223c 100 eV, sterile neutrinos make an excellent warm dark matter candidate."

We have pieced together a remarkably successful cosmological model, but it requires three new pieces of physics: dark matter, dark energy, and inflation. My perception of the goal of cosmology over the coming decade is to extract as much information as possible from increasingly sensitive surveys to either learn about this new physics: What is the dark matter? Is the dark energy vacuum energy? If so, why does it have such a peculiar value? Did inflation really happen? If so, is there any way to relate the fields that drove inflation to those we know about today? I serve as co-chair of the Science Committee for the Dark Energy Survey, am actively involved in the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration, and work with data from the South Pole Telescope. The thread connecting these observations to underlying theories requires us to understand the data well, phenomenological modeling of the astrophysics and cosmological perturbations, and the possible theoretical alternatives to what is slowly becoming dogma. It is a privilege and pleasure to work with colleagues around the world as we tackle these age-old questions with data sets that are truly extraordinary. P. Li, S. Dodelson and R. A. C.
