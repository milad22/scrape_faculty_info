                "The two-dimensional radial vs poloidal structure and motion of edge turbulence in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) were measured using high-speed imaging of the visible light emission from a localized neutral gas puff. Edge turbulence images are shown and analysed for Ohmic, L-and H-mode plasma conditions. The two-dimensional images often show regions of strong localized light emission known as' blobs', which move both poloidally and radially at a typical speed of\u2248 10 5 cm s\u2212 1, and sometimes show spatially periodic features.",
                "The two-dimensional (2D) radial vs poloidal structure of edge turbulence in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak [I. H. Hutchinson, R. Boivin, P. T. Bonoli et al., Nucl. Fusion 41, 1391 (2001)] was measured using fast cameras and compared with three-dimensional numerical simulations of edge plasma turbulence. The main diagnostic is gas puff imaging, in which the visible D\u03b1 emission from a localized D2 gas puff is viewed along a local magnetic field line. The observed D\u03b1 fluctuations have a typical radial and poloidal scale of \u22481 cm, and often have strong local maxima (\u201cblobs\u201d) in the scrape-off layer. The motion of this 2D structure motion has also been measured using an ultrafast framing camera with 12 frames taken at 250\u200a000 frames\/s. Numerical simulations produce turbulent structures with roughly similar spatial and temporal scales and transport levels as that observed in the experiment; however, some differences \u2026",
                "With nonperturbative laser-induced fluorescence measurements of ion flow, we confirm numerical simulations of spontaneous electric double-layer (DL) formation in a current-free expanding plasma. Measurements in two different experiments confirm that the DL is localized to the region of rapidly diverging magnetic field. The measurements indicate that the trapped ion population is a single Maxwellian, that the spatial gradient of the energy of ions accelerated through the DL matches the magnetic field gradient, and that DL formation is triggered when the ion-neutral collisional mean-free path exceeds the magnetic field gradient scale length.",
                "Experimental data are presented that are consistent with the hypothesis that anomalous rf absorption in helicon sources is due to electron scattering arising from parametrically driven ion-acoustic waves downstream from the antenna. Also presented are ion temperature measurements demonstrating anisotropic heating (T\u22a5> T||) at the edge of the discharge. The most likely explanation is ion-Landau damping of electrostatic slow waves at a local lower-hybrid-frequency resonance.",
                "We present an analysis of laser-induced fluorescence and emission spectroscopy profile measurements of the excited states of neutral argon for two different helicon source pressures. Through use of a collisional\u2013radiative model that calculates excited state profiles based on measured electron densities, electron temperatures, and the measured edge neutral pressure, the ground state neutral density profile is determined for each pressure case. The results demonstrate that it is possible to extract the ground state neutral density profile from such measurements and that the degree of ionization at the center (r= 0) of a helicon source plasma can vary significantly for a small change in source pressure.",

                "Recently, we demonstrated that a single, tunable, low-power, diode laser can be used for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements of both argon ions and helium neutrals. We have now identified a third fluorescence scheme, for neutral argon atoms, accessible with the same tunable diode laser. Fluorescence measurements of a heated iodine cell are used to monitor the wavelength of the laser during the LIF measurement.",
                " Dawn\u2013dusk asymmetries are ubiquitous features of the coupled solar-wind\u2013magnetosphere\u2013ionosphere system. During the last decades, increasing availability of satellite and ground-based measurements has made it possible to study these phenomena in more detail. Numerous publications have documented the existence of persistent asymmetries in processes, properties and topology of plasma structures in various regions of geospace. In this paper, we present a review of our present knowledge of some of the most pronounced dawn\u2013dusk asymmetries. We focus on four key aspects: (1) the role of external influences such as the solar wind and its interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere; (2) properties of the magnetosphere itself; (3) the role of the ionosphere and (4) feedback and coupling between regions. We have also identified potential inconsistencies and gaps in our understanding of dawn\u2013dusk asymmetries in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.",
                "A portable, low-power, diode laser-based laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostic incorporating a heated iodine cell for absolute wavelength reference was installed on the Chi-Kung helicon source [K. K. Chi, T. E. Sheridan, and R. W. Boswell, Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 8, 421 (1999)] to measure the ion velocity distribution function of argon ions as they transited a current-free double layer (DL) created where the solenoidal magnetic field diverges at the junction of the plasma source and the diffusion chamber. Based on LIF measurements of the transiting ion beam energy, the strength of the potential drop across the DL increases with decreasing neutral pressure and increasing magnetic field strength in the source. The location of the double layer also moves further downstream of the helicon source with increasing pressure. LIF measurements of the ion beam energy were found to be in good agreement with \u2026",
                "Neutral atoms play important roles in non-fully-ionized plasmas. In helicon sources, neutral pumping and neutral damping of waves are poorly understood. Measurement of the spatial distribution of neutral atoms is possible with spectroscopic diagnostics such as laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and passive emission spectroscopy. However, these measurements typically apply to an excited neutral atom state, rather than the entire neutral population. With a collisional-radiative (CR) model employing Langmuir probe measured electron parameters in argon helicon source plasmas, we have reproduced LIF and emission spectroscopy measured radial profiles for three excited neutral states. The CR model indicates a neutral depletion on axis of at least 60%. Simple calculations based on measured edge neutral pressures and peak plasma densities significantly underestimate the degree of ionization in the core of the \u2026"
