                "We report the experimental realization of an optical trap that localizes single Cs atoms\u2243 215 nm from the surface of a dielectric nanofiber. By operating at magic wavelengths for pairs of counterpropagating red-and blue-detuned trapping beams, differential scalar light shifts are eliminated, and vector shifts are suppressed by\u2248 250. We thereby measure an absorption linewidth \u0393\/2 \u03c0= 5.7\u00b10.1 MHz for the Cs 6 S 1\/2, F= 4\u2192 6 P 3\/2, F\u2032= 5 transition, where \u0393 0\/2 \u03c0= 5.2 MHz in free space. An optical depth d\u2243 66 is observed, corresponding to an optical depth per atom d 1\u2243 0.08. These advances provide an important capability for the implementation of functional quantum optical networks and precision atomic spectroscopy near dielectric surfaces.",
                "Electrically induced electron spin polarization is imaged in n-type ZnSe epilayers using Kerr rotation spectroscopy. Despite no evidence for an electrically induced internal magnetic field, current-induced in-plane spin polarization is observed with characteristic spin lifetimes that decrease with doping density. The spin Hall effect is also observed, indicated by an electrically induced out-of-plane spin polarization with opposite sign for spins accumulating on opposite edges of the sample. The spin Hall conductivity is estimated as 3\u00b11.5 \u03a9\u2212 1 m\u2212 1\/| e| at 20 K, which is consistent with the extrinsic mechanism. Both the current-induced spin polarization and the spin Hall effect are observed at temperatures from 10 to 295 K.",
                "Cavity quantum electrodynamics provides the setting for quantum control of strong interactions between a single atom and one photon. Many such atom\u2013cavity systems interacting by coherent exchanges of single photons could be the basis for scalable quantum networks. However, moving beyond current proof-of-principle experiments involving just one or two conventional optical cavities requires the localization of individual atoms at distances\u2272 100 nm from a resonator\u2019s surface. In this regime an atom can be strongly coupled to a single intracavity photon while at the same time experiencing significant radiative interactions with the dielectric boundaries of the resonator. Here, we report using real-time detection and high-bandwidth feedback to select and monitor single caesium atoms located\u223c 100 nm from the surface of a microtoroidal optical resonator. Strong radiative interactions of atom and cavity field probe \u2026",
                "Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides are two-dimensional (2D) direct-bandgap semiconductors with degenerate, but inequivalent,\u2018valleys\u2019 in the electronic structure that can be selectively excited by polarized light. Coherent superpositions of light and matter, exciton\u2013polaritons, have been observed when these materials are strongly coupled to photons, but these hybrid quasiparticles do not harness the valley sensitivity of the monolayer semiconductors. Here, we observe valley-polarized exciton\u2013polaritons in monolayers of MoS 2 embedded in a dielectric microcavity. These light\u2013matter quasiparticles emit polarized light with spectral Rabi splitting and anticrossing indicative of strongly coupled exciton\u2013polaritons in the topologically separate spin-coupled valleys. The interplay of intervalley depolarization and cavity-modified exciton dynamics in the high-cooperativity regime causes valley-polarized \u2026"

Stern\u2019s research objective is to explore the novel optical, spin, and magnetic properties of integrated nano-scale and hybrid photonic systems, focusing on the quantum interactions and collective behavior between photons and low-dimensional electronic structures. Probing a variety of systems such as single-atomic layer materials and hybrid photonic devices with diverse experimental approaches such as time-resolved spectroscopy and single-photon detection, the Stern Group works to understand how light and matter interact on the smallest scales, with potential impact throughout the disciplines of photonics, quantum information, magnetism, materials science, and nanoscience.
