                "This review describes recent research into the properties of the chromophore-TiO2 interface that forms the basis for photoinduced charge separation in dye-sensitized semiconductor solar cells. It focuses particularly on an atomistic picture of the electron-injection dynamics. The interface offers an excellent case study, pertinent as well to a variety of other photovoltaic systems, photo- and electrochemistry, molecular electronics, analytical detection, photography, and quantum confinement devices. The differences between chemists\u2019 and physicists\u2019 models for describing molecules and bulk materials, respectively, create challenges for the characterization of interfaces that include both of these components. We give an overall picture of the interface by starting with a description of the properties of the chromophores and semiconductor separately, and then by discussing the coupled system, including the chromophore \u2026",
                "The mean-field treatment of electron-nuclear interaction results in many qualitative breakdowns in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) density functional theory. Examples include current-induced heating in nanoelectronics, charge dynamics in quantum dots and carbon nanotubes, and relaxation of biological chromophores. The problem is resolved by the trajectory surface-hopping TDKS approach, which is illustrated by the photoinduced electron injection from a molecular chromophore into TiO 2, and the excited-state relaxation of the green fluorescent protein chromophore.",
                "As the world\u2019s population increases and substantial industrial growth continues, the energy demands of society increase rapidly. Although the earth\u2019s oil, natural gas, and coal deposits constitute the main source of energy and fuel currently, their exploration and production are difficult and problematic. The byproducts and chemicals used in the extraction and refinement of fossil fuels can cause significant harm to the environment. The consumption of organic fuel is not sustainable and results in severe damage to the environment, causing pollution and other effects that lead to global warming. The energy produced by the sun and carried down to earth by its radiation provides an alternative and clean source of energy to meet and exceed the world\u2019s energy consumption demands. A remaining fundamental challenge is in the development of efficient methods of harvesting solar energy that are accessible and cost \u2026",
                "Molecular dynamics simulations of many degree of freedom systems are often comprised of classical evolutions on quantum adiabatic energy surfaces with intermittent instantaneous hops from one surface to another. However, since quantum transitions are inherently nonadiabatic processes, the adiabatic approximation underlying the classical equations of motion does not hold in the regions where quantum transitions take place, and the restriction to classical trajectories for adiabatic quantum states is an approximation. Alternatives which employ classical paths that account more fully for nonadiabaticity can be computationally expensive and algorithmically complicated. Here, we propose a new method, which combines the surface hopping idea with the mean-field approximation for classical paths. Applied to three test systems, the method is shown to outperform the methods based on an adiabatic force without \u2026",
                "This work introduces the PYXAID program, developed for non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations in condensed matter systems. By applying the classical path approximation to the fewest switches surface hopping approach, we have developed an efficient computational tool that can be applied to study photoinduced dynamics at the ab initio level in systems composed of hundreds of atoms and involving thousands of electronic states. The technique is used to study in detail the ultrafast relaxation of hot electrons in crystalline pentacene. The simulated relaxation occurs on a 500 fs time scale, in excellent agreement with experiment, and is driven by molecular lattice vibrations in the 200\u2013250 cm\u20131 frequency range. The PYXAID program is organized as a Python extension module and can be easily combined with other Python-driven modules, enhancing user-friendliness and flexibility of the software. The \u2026",
                "In this paper, we explore in detail the way in which quantum decoherence is treated in different mixed quantum\u2010classical molecular dynamics algorithms. The quantum decoherence time proves to be a key ingredient in the production of accurate nonadiabatic dynamics from computer simulations. Based on a short time expansion to a semiclassical golden rule expression due to Neria and Nitzan [J. Chem. Phys. 99, 1109 (1993)], we develop a new computationally efficient method for estimating the decay of quantum coherence in condensed phase molecular simulations. Using the hydrated electron as an example, application of this method finds that quantum decoherence times are on the order of a few femtoseconds for condensed phase chemical systems and that they play a direct role in determining nonadiabatic transition rates. The decay of quantum coherence for the solvated electron is found to take \u224a50 \u2026",
                "The observed 6-fs photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the alizarin chromophore into the TiO2 surface is investigated by ab initio nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics in real time and at the atomistic level of detail. The system derives from the dye-sensitized semiconductor Gr\u00e4tzel cell and addresses the problems of an organic\/inorganic interface that are commonly encountered in photovoltaics, photochemistry, and molecular electronics. In contrast to the typical Gr\u00e4tzel cell systems, where molecular donors are in resonance with a high density of semiconductor acceptor states, TiO2 sensitized with alizarin presents a novel case in which the molecular photoexcited state is at the edge of the conduction band (CB). The high level ab initio analysis of the optical absorption spectrum supports this observation. Thermal fluctuations of atomic coordinates are particularly important both in generating a nonuniform \u2026",
                "A simple surface hopping method for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is developed. The method derives from a stochastic modeling of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger and master equations for open systems and accounts simultaneously for quantum mechanical branching in the otherwise classical (nuclear) degrees of freedom and loss of coherence within the quantum (electronic) subsystem due to coupling to nuclei. Electronic dynamics in the Hilbert space takes the form of a unitary evolution, intermittent with stochastic decoherence events that are manifested as a localization toward (adiabatic) basis states. Classical particles evolve along a single potential energy surface and can switch surfaces only at the decoherence events. Thus, decoherence provides physical justification of surface hopping, obviating the need for ad hoc surface hopping rules. The method is tested with model problems, showing good \u2026",
                "We report an ab initio density functional theory study of the interaction of four nucleobases, cytosine, thymine, adenine, and guanine, with a novel graphene nanopore device for detecting the base sequence of a single-stranded nucleic acid (ssDNA or RNA). The nucleobases were inserted into a pore in a graphene nanoribbon, and the electrical current and conductance spectra were calculated as functions of voltage applied across the nanoribbon. The conductance spectra and charge densities were analyzed in the presence of each nucleobase in the graphene nanopore. The results indicate that due to significant differences in the conductance spectra the proposed device has adequate sensitivity to discriminate between different nucleotides. Moreover, we show that the nucleotide conductance spectrum is affected little by its orientation inside the graphene nanopore. The proposed technique may be extremely \u2026",
                "The impact of quantum decoherence and zero point motion on non-adiabatic transition rates in condensed matter systems is studied in relation to non-adiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics (MD) techniques. Both effects, and decoherence in particular, strongly influence the transition rate, while neither is accounted for by straightforward quantum-classical approaches. Quantum corrections to the quantum-classical results are rigorously introduced based on Kubo\u2019s generating function formulation of Fermi\u2019s Golden rule and the frozen Gaussian approximation for the nuclear wave functions. The development provides a one-to-one correspondence between the decoherence function and the Franck\u2013Condon factor. The decoherence function defined in this paper corrects an error in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 104, 5942 (1996)]. The relationship between the short time approach and the real time NA MD is \u2026"
