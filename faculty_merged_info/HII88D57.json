                "This textbook presents a systematic and unifying viewpoint for a wide class of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques in time domain and frequency domain. It is directed towards active researchers in physics, optics, chemistry, and materials science, as well as graduate students who enter this complex and rapidly developing field. Nonlinear optical interactions of laser fields with matter provide powerful spectroscopic tools for the understanding of microscopic interactions and dynamic processes. One of the major obstacles facing researchers in this field, however, is the flood of experimental techniques and terminologies, which create a serious language barrier. The general microscopic correlation function approach to the nonlinear optical response developed in this book is essential for understanding the relationships among different techniques and a comparison of their information content, the design of new measurements, and for a systematic comparison of the optical response of different systems such as dyes in solutions, atoms and molecules in the gas phase, liquids, molecular aggregates and superlatives, and semiconductor nanostructures. The approach is based on formulating the nonlinear response by representing the state of matter by the density matrix and following its evolution on Liouville space. Current active research areas such as femtosecond time-domain techniques, semi-classical and wave-packet dynamics, pulse shaping, pulse locking, exciton confinement, and the interplay of electronic, nuclear and field coherence are emphasized. The material has been developed from the author's highly successful interdisciplinary course \u2026",
                "Fluctuation theorems (FTs), which describe some universal properties of nonequilibrium fluctuations, are examined from a quantum perspective and derived by introducing a two-point measurement on the system. FTs for closed and open systems driven out of equilibrium by an external time-dependent force, and for open systems maintained in a nonequilibrium steady state by nonequilibrium boundary conditions, are derived from a unified approach. Applications to fermion and boson transport in quantum junctions are discussed. Quantum master equations and Green\u2019s functions techniques for computing the energy and particle statistics are presented.",
                "Femtosecond visible and infrared analogues of multiple-pulse nuclear magnetic resonance techniques provide novel snapshot probes into the structure and electronic and vibrational dynamics of complex molecular assemblies such as photosynthetic antennae, proteins, and hydrogen-bonded liquids. A classical-oscillator description of these spectroscopies in terms of interacting quasiparticles (rather than transitions among global eigenstates) is developed and sets the stage for designing new pulse sequences and inverting the multidimensional signals to yield molecular structures. Considerable computational advantages and a clear physical insight into the origin of the response and the relevant coherence sizes are provided by a real-space analysis of the underlying coherence-transfer pathways in Liouville space.",
                "The nonlinear optical response of liquids subjected to a series of N femtosecond laser pulses is calculated using a multimode harmonic model for nuclear motions, with nonlinear coupling to the radiation field through the coordinate dependence of the electronic polarizability. Using electronically off\u2010resonant optical fields, this multidimensional spectroscopy is shown to provide direct information regarding the homogeneous or the inhomogeneous nature of the spectral density obtained from optical birefringence measurements. Complementary information can be obtained using infrared pulses where the multiple time correlation functions of the nuclear dipole moment (rather than the electronic polarizability) are being probed.",
                "An understanding of electron-initiated processes in aqueous systems and the subsequent radical chemistry these processes induce is significant in such diverse fields as waste remediation and environmental cleanup, radiation processing, nuclear reactors, and medical diagnosis and therapy. We review the state of the art in the physical chemistry and chemical physics of electron-initiated processes in aqueous systems and raise critical research issues and fundamental questions that remain unanswered.",
                "Predicting the electronic structure of extended organic molecules constitutes an important fundamental task of modern chemistry. Studies of electronic excitations, charge-transfer, energy-transfer, and isomerization of conjugated systems form the basis for our understanding of the photophysics and photochemistry of complex molecules1-3 as well as organic nanostructures and supramolecular assemblies. 4, 5 Photosynthesis and other photochemical biological processes that constitute the basis of life on Earth involve assemblies of conjugated chromophores such as porphyrins, chlorophylls, and carotenoids. 6-8 Apart from the fundamental interest, these studies are also closely connected to numerous important technological applications. 9 Conjugated polymers are primary candidates for new organic optical materials with large nonlinear polarizabilities. 10-19 Potential applications include electroluminescence \u2026",
                "Molecular aggregates are abundant in nature; they form spontaneously in concentrated solutions and on surfaces and can be synthesized by supramolecular chemistry techniques. 1-3 Assemblies of chromophores play important roles in many biological processes such as light-harvesting and primary",
                "A theory for four-wave-mixing signals from molecular aggregates, which includes effects of two-exciton states, static disorder, and coupling to a phonon bath with an arbitrary spectral density, is developed. The third-order polarization is rigorously partitioned into a coherent and a sequential contribution. The latter is given by a sum of an exciton-hopping and a ground state (bleaching) terms, both expressed using the doorway-window representation. Applications are made to photon-echo and pump-probe spectroscopies of the B850 system of the LH2 antenna in purple bacteria.",
                "We present a spectroscopic method for the complete characterization of the quantum state of the vibrational mode of a molecule in terms of a phase-space quasiprobability distribution. The distribution for a molecular vibrational mode excited by a short optical pulse is reconstructed from measurements of its time-dependent spectrum of fluorescence.",
                "We investigate the third-order nonlinear-optical susceptibility \u03c7 (3) in molecular aggregates and its scaling with aggregate size. The aggregate is modeled as a collection of N-interacting, homogeneously broadened two-level systems, where the interaction includes both the static dipole-dipole coupling and superradiant coupling. Our expression for \u03c7 (3), derived using Liouville-space Green-function techniques, contains contributions from excitons as well as biexcitons. The scaling of \u03c7 (3) with aggregate size and its dependence on the laser detuning and homogeneous and inhomogeneous dephasing rates are analyzed. \u03c7 (3) contains terms that scale as\u223c N 2 and\u223c N (N-1). However, under off-resonant conditions these terms interfere destructively, resulting in a linear\u223c N scaling, which is precisely what is expected for N monomers.
