                "We report on a search for particle dark matter with the XENON100 experiment, operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso for 13 months during 2011 and 2012. XENON100 features an ultralow electromagnetic background of (5.3\u00b10.6)\u00d7 10\u2212 3 events\/(keV ee\u00d7 kg\u00d7 day) in the energy region of interest. A blind analysis of 224.6 live days\u00d7 34 kg exposure has yielded no evidence for dark matter interactions. The two candidate events observed in the predefined nuclear recoil energy range of 6.6\u201330.5 keV nr are consistent with the background expectation of (1.0\u00b10.2) events. A profile likelihood analysis using a 6.6\u201343.3 keV nr energy range sets the most stringent limit on the spin-independent elastic weakly interacting massive particle\u2013nucleon scattering cross section for weakly interacting massive particle masses above 8 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 2\u00d7 10\u2212 45 cm 2 at 55 GeV\/c 2 and 90% confidence level.",
                "We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) using 278.8 days of data collected with the XENON1T experiment at LNGS. XENON1T utilizes a liquid xenon time projection chamber with a fiducial mass of (1.30\u00b10.01) t o n, resulting in a 1.0 ton yr exposure. The energy region of interest,[1.4, 10.6] keV ee ([4.9, 40.9] keV nr), exhibits an ultralow electron recoil background rate of [82\u2212 3+ 5 (syst)\u00b13 (stat)] events\/(t o n yr keV ee). No significant excess over background is found, and a profile likelihood analysis parametrized in spatial and energy dimensions excludes new parameter space for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic scatter cross section for WIMP masses above 6 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 4.1\u00d7 10\u2212 47 cm 2 at 30 GeV\/c 2 and a 90% confidence level.",
                "The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5\u00d7 10 18 eV, derived from 20 000 events recorded at the Pierre Auger Observatory, is described. The spectral index \u03b3 of the particle flux, J\u221d E\u2212 \u03b3, at energies between 4\u00d7 10 18 eV and 4\u00d7 10 19 eV is 2.69\u00b10.02 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst), steepening to 4.2\u00b10.4 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst) at higher energies. The hypothesis of a single power law is rejected with a significance greater than 6 standard deviations. The data are consistent with the prediction by Greisen and by Zatsepin and Kuz\u2019min.",
                "We report the first dark matter search results from XENON1T, a\u223c 2000\u2212 kg-target-mass dual-phase (liquid-gas) xenon time projection chamber in operation at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy and the first ton-scale detector of this kind. The blinded search used 34.2 live days of data acquired between November 2016 and January 2017. Inside the (1042\u00b112)\u2212 kg fiducial mass and in the [5, 40] keV nr energy range of interest for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter searches, the electronic recoil background was (1.93\u00b10.25)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 events\/(kg\u00d7 day\u00d7 keV ee), the lowest ever achieved in such a dark matter detector. A profile likelihood analysis shows that the data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. We derive the most stringent exclusion limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section for WIMP masses above 10 GeV\/c 2, with a minimum of 7.7\u00d7 \u2026",
                "We present results from the direct search for dark matter with the XENON100 detector, installed underground at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of INFN, Italy. XENON100 is a two-phase time-projection chamber with a 62 kg liquid xenon target. Interaction vertex reconstruction in three dimensions with millimeter precision allows the selection of only the innermost 48 kg as the ultralow background fiducial target. In 100.9 live days of data, acquired between January and June 2010, no evidence for dark matter is found. Three candidate events were observed in the signal region with an expected background of (1.8\u00b10.6) events. This leads to the most stringent limit on dark matter interactions today, excluding spin-independent elastic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) nucleon scattering cross sections above 7.0\u00d7 10\u2212 45 cm 2 for a WIMP mass of 50 GeV\/c 2 at 90% confidence level.",
                "The XENON10 experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory uses a 15 kg xenon dual phase time projection chamber to search for dark matter weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The detector measures simultaneously the scintillation and the ionization produced by radiation in pure liquid xenon to discriminate signal from background down to 4.5 keV nuclear-recoil energy. A blind analysis of 58.6 live days of data, acquired between October 6, 2006, and February 14, 2007, and using a fiducial mass of 5.4 kg, excludes previously unexplored parameter space, setting a new 90% CL upper limit for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section of 8.8\u00d7 10\u2212 44 cm 2 for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV\/c 2, and 4.5\u00d7 10\u2212 44 cm 2 for a WIMP mass of 30 GeV\/c 2. This result further constrains predictions of supersymmetric models.",
                "Data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration, Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than \u223c6 \u00d7 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than \u223c75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuz\u2019min effect). The angular scale of the correlation \u2026",
                "The XENON1T experiment is currently in the commissioning phase at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. In this article we study the experiment's expected sensitivity to the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section, based on Monte Carlo predictions of the electronic and nuclear recoil backgrounds.",
                "We report results of a search for light (\u2272 10 GeV) particle dark matter with the XENON10 detector. The event trigger was sensitive to a single electron, with the analysis threshold of 5 electrons corresponding to 1.4 keV nuclear recoil energy. Considering spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering, we exclude cross sections \u03c3 n> 7\u00d7 10\u2212 42 cm 2, for a dark matter particle mass m \u03c7= 7 GeV. We find that our data strongly constrain recent elastic dark matter interpretations of excess low-energy events observed by CoGeNT and CRESST-II, as well as the DAMA annual modulation signal."
