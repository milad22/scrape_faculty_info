                "\u2018Sudden\u2019quantum quench and prethermalization have become a cross-cutting theme for discovering emergent states of matter 1, 2, 3, 4. Yet this remains challenging in electron matter 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, especially superconductors 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The grand question of what is hidden underneath superconductivity (SC) 15 appears universal, but poorly understood. Here we reveal a long-lived gapless quantum phase of prethermalized quasiparticles (QPs) after a single-cycle terahertz (THz) quench of a Nb 3 Sn SC gap. Its conductivity spectra is characterized by a sharp coherent peak and a vanishing scattering rate that decreases almost linearly towards zero frequency, which is most pronounced around the full depletion of the condensate and absent for a high-frequency pump. Above a critical pump threshold, such a QP phase with coherent transport and memory persists as an unusual prethermalization plateau \u2026",
                "Light-induced supercurrents chart a path forward for the electromagnetic design of emergent materials phases and collective modes for quantum engineering applications. However, controlled spatial\u2013temporal modulation of the complex order parameter characterizing such non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states remains elusive. Such ultrafast phase-amplitude modulation can manifest via high harmonic modes beyond those allowed by equilibrium symmetries. Here, we drive moving condensate states via subcycle dynamical symmetry breaking achieved with nonlinear oscillating terahertz photocurrents. These non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states with broken inversion symmetry are controlled via Cooper pair acceleration by asymmetric and multi-cycle terahertz photoexcitations. The observed supercurrent-carrying states evolve during a lightwave cycle and exhibit three distinguishing features \u2026",
                "Topology-protected surface transport of ultimate thinness in three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) is breaking new ground in quantum science and technology. Yet a challenge remains on how to disentangle and selectively control surface helical spin transport from the bulk contribution. Here we use the mid-infrared and terahertz (THz) photoexcitation of exclusive intraband transitions to enable ultrafast manipulation of surface THz conductivity in Bi 2 Se 3. The unique, transient electronic state is characterized by frequency-dependent carrier relaxations that directly distinguish the faster surface channel than the bulk with no complication from interband excitations or need for reduced bulk doping. We determine the topological enhancement ratio between bulk and surface scattering rates, ie, \u03b3 BS\/\u03b3 SS~ 3.80 in equilibrium. The ultra-broadband, wavelength-selective pumping may be applied to emerging \u2026",
                "We report terahertz (THz) electrodynamics of a moderately clean A15 superconductor (SC) following ultrafast excitation to manipulate quasiparticle (QP) transport. In the Martensitic normal state, we observe a photo enhancement in the THz conductivity using optical pulses, while the opposite is observed for the THz pump. This demonstrates wavelength-selective nonthermal control of conductivity distinct from sample heating. The photo enhancement persists up to an additional critical temperature, above the SC one, from a competing electronic order. In the SC state, the fluence dependence of pair-breaking kinetics together with an analytic model provides an implication for a \u201cone photon to one Cooper pair\u201d nonresonant energy transfer during the 35-fs laser pulse; ie, the fitted photon energy \u210f \u03c9 absorption to create QPs set by 2 \u0394 S C\/\u210f \u03c9= 0.33%. This is more than one order of magnitude smaller than in previously \u2026",
                "We report terahertz (THz) light-induced second harmonic generation, in superconductors with inversion symmetry that forbid even-order nonlinearities. The THz second harmonic emission vanishes above the superconductor critical temperature and arises from precession of twisted Anderson pseudospins at a multicycle, THz driving frequency that is not allowed by equilibrium symmetry. We explain the microscopic physics by a dynamical symmetry breaking principle at sub-THz-cycle by using quantum kinetic modeling of the interplay between strong THz-lightwave nonlinearity and pulse propagation. The resulting nonzero integrated pulse area inside the superconductor leads to light-induced nonlinear supercurrents due to subcycle Cooper pair acceleration, in contrast to dc-biased superconductors, which can be controlled by the band structure and THz driving field below the superconducting gap.",
                "A grand challenge underlies the entire field of topology-enabled quantum logic and information science: how to establish topological control principles driven by quantum coherence and understand the time dependence of such periodic driving. Here we demonstrate a few-cycle THz-pulse-induced phase transition in a Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 that is periodically driven by vibrational coherence due to excitation of the lowest Raman active mode. Above a critical THz-pump field threshold, there emerges a long-lived metastable phase, approximately 100 ps, with unique Raman phonon-assisted topological switching dynamics absent for optical pumping. The switching also manifests itself by distinct features: nonthermal spectral shape, relaxation slowing near the Lifshitz transition where the critical Dirac point occurs, and diminishing signals at the same temperature that the Berry-curvature-induced anomalous Hall effect \u2026",
                "In classical morphotropic piezoelectric materials, rhombohedral and tetragonal phase variants can energetically compete to form a mixed phase regime with improved functional properties. While the discovery of morphotropic-like phases in multiferroic BiFeO3 films has broadened this definition, accessing these phase spaces is still typically accomplished through isovalent substitution or heteroepitaxial strain which do not allow for continuous modification of phase composition postsynthesis. Here, we show that it is possible to use low-energy helium implantation to tailor morphotropic phases of epitaxial BiFeO3 films postsynthesis in a continuous and iterative manner. Applying this strain doping approach to morphotropic films creates a new phase space based on internal and external lattice stress that can be seen as an analogue to temperature\u2013composition phase diagrams of classical morphotropic ferroelectric \u2026",
                "The demand for disorder-tolerant quantum logic and spin electronics can be met by generating and controlling dissipationless spin currents protected by topology. Dirac fermions with helical spin-locking surface transport offer a way of achieving such a goal. Yet, surface-bulk coupling can lead to strong Dirac electron scattering with bulk carriers and phonons as well as impurities, assisted by such dissipative channel, which results in \u201ctopological breakdown\u201d. Here, we demonstrate that coherent lattice vibrations periodically driven by a single-cycle terahertz (THz) pulse can significantly suppress such dissipative channel in topological insulators. This is achieved by reducing the phase space in the bulk available for Dirac fermion scattering into during coherent lattice oscillations in Bi 2 Se 3. This light-induced suppression manifests as a remarkable transition exclusively in surface transport, absent for bulk, above the \u2026",
                "We discover hidden Rashba fine structure in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and demonstrate its quantum control by vibrational coherence through symmetry-selective vibronic (electron-phonon) coupling. Above a critical threshold of a single-cycle terahertz pump field, a Raman phonon mode distinctly modulates the middle excitonic states with persistent coherence for more than ten times longer than the ones on two sides that predominately couple to infrared phonons. These vibronic quantum beats, together with first-principles modeling of phonon periodically modulated Rashba parameters, identify a threefold excitonic fine structure splitting, ie, optically forbidden, degenerate dark states in between two bright ones with a narrow,\u223c 3 nm splitting. Harnessing of vibronic quantum coherence and symmetry inspires light-perovskite quantum control and sub-THz-cycle \u201cRashba engineering\u201d of spin-split bands for ultimate \u2026",
                "We investigate the interplay between coherent gap dynamics and damping in superconductors taken out of equilibrium by strong optical pulses with subgap terahertz frequencies. A semiphenomenological formalism is developed to include the damping within the electronic subsystem that arises from effects beyond Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer mean-field theory, such as interactions between Bogoliubov quasiparticles and decay of the Higgs mode. These processes, conveniently expressed as longitudinal T 1 and transverse T 2 relaxation times in the standard pseudospin language for superconductors, cause the gap amplitude to be suppressed after the pulse is turned off, but before the timescale where thermalization occurs due to coupling to the lattice. We show that our model quantitatively captures the experimental gap dynamics reported here of NbN and Nb 3 Sn through the picosecond timescale."
