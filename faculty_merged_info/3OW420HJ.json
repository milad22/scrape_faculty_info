                "Kenneth \"Kip\" Matthews Associate Professor of Physics Ph.D., 1997 - The University of Chicago 459-B Nicholson Hall, Tower Dr. (225) 578-2740-Office kipmatth@lsu.edu Diplomate, 2001 - American Board of Radiology (Medical Nuclear Physics) Medical Imaging\u00a0Physics My general field of interest is Medical Physics. In particular, I am interested in\n                  the physics of medical imaging -- the application of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation\n                  to visualize in vivo anatomy and physiology. Secondary interests include the application of imaging techniques\n                  to basic research in other fields (e.g., biology, veterinary science, engineering,\n                  etc). My research principally deals with detector systems for radioisotope imaging - - that\n                  is, using the gamma-ray emissions of internally-distributed radiopharmaceuticals to\n                  visualize in vivo physiology, pathophysiology and metabolic processes. Because of our program's extensive\n                  involvement with radiation therapy physics, I'm also involved with radioisotope imaging\n                  techniques applied to radiation therapy. Current projects include: CZT radiation detectors portable hand-held detectors for locating radiation sources in the environment (radiation\n                        protection) or inside the body (intraoperative localization) development of gamma cameras based on CZT detectors Depth-of-interaction detectors for PET imaging scintillating fibers added to conventional gamma camera designs layered-scintillator detector designs PET\/CT applications to radiation therapy ROC analysis of diagnostic performance consolidated QA methods and phantoms Synchrotron X-ray microtomography imaging comparative morphology of cornified tissues (claws, beaks, hooves) imaging of iodinated DNS-targeted compounds for Auger electron therapy What is Medical Physics If you want the circular definition, \"medical physics\" is the field of physics as\n                  applied to medicine. But that isn't very informative. A better definition can be found in the AAPM brochure The Medical Physicist : \"Medical physics is primarily an applied branch of physics. It is concerned with the\n                  applications of the concepts and methods of physics to the diagnosis and treatment\n                  of human disease. It is allied with medical electronics (the development of medical\n                  instruments), bioengineering (the application of engineering principles to biology\n                  and medicine), and health physics (the assessment and control of radiation hazards). \"Several distinct professional areas have emerged for the medical physicist. These\n                  include, for example, the application of ionizing radiation to medical diagnosis and\n                  therapy (radiological physics); bioelectrical investigations of the brain and heart\n                  (electroencephalography and electrocardiography); and the medical uses of infrared\n                  radiation (thermography), ultrasound (sonography), nuclear magnetic resonance (magnetic\n                  resonance imaging), heat (hyperthermia for cancer treatment), and lasers (for laser\n                  surgery). \"Medical physics thus is a broad, multidisciplinary field. The branch of medical physics\n                  with which most people are familiar is diagnostic imaging physics -- almost everyone\n                  has gotten x-rays during medical or dental checkups. Each year, many people receive\n                  CT and MRI scans, PET and SPECT scans, and ultrasound exams. All of these imaging\n                  modalities are the result of many years of research and development by medical physicists.\" Background and Education I received a B.A. degree (majoring in Chemistry and Physics) from Austin College (Sherman,\n                  TX) in 1990. In 1997, I received a Ph.D. in Medical Physics from The University of\n                  Chicago (Chicago, IL). From early 1997 through July 2001, I worked as clinical and\n                  research physicist at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. I received\n                  my clinical certification in medical nuclear physics from the American Board of Radiology\n                  in June 2001. I joined the faculty of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at LSU in August 2001.\n                  My role is to provide medical imaging expertise, teaching, and research to LSU Medical Physics & Health Physics Program .
