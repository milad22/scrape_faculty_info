                "We consider general curvature-invariant modifications of the Einstein-Hilbert action that become important only in regions of extremely low space-time curvature. We investigate the far future evolution of the Universe in such models, examining the possibilities for cosmic acceleration and other ultimate destinies. The models generically possess de Sitter space as an unstable solution and exhibit an interesting set of attractor solutions which, in some cases, provide alternatives to dark energy models.",
                "We present a wide class of models which realise a bounce in a spatially flat Friedmann universe in standard General Relativity. The key ingredient of the theories we consider is a noncanonical, minimally coupled scalar field belonging to the class of theories with Kinetic Gravity Braiding\/Galileon-like self-couplings. In these models, the universe smoothly evolves from contraction to expansion, suffering neither from ghosts nor gradient instabilities around the turning point. The end-point of the evolution can be a standard radiation-domination era or an inflationary phase. We formulate necessary restrictions for Lagrangians needed to obtain a healthy bounce and illustrate our results with phase portraits for simple systems including the recently proposed Galilean Genesis scenario.",
                "We present a nonsingular bouncing cosmology using single scalar field matter with non-trivial potential and non-standard kinetic term. The potential sources a dynamical attractor solution with Ekpyrotic contraction which washes out small amplitude anisotropies. At high energy densities the field evolves into a ghost condensate, leading to a nonsingular bounce. Following the bounce there is a smooth transition to standard expanding radiation and matter dominated phases. Using linear cosmological perturbation theory we track each Fourier mode of the curvature fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution. Using standard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies we verify that the spectral index does not change during the bounce. We show there is a controlled period of exponential growth of the fluctuation amplitude for the perturbations (but not for gravitational waves) around the bounce \u2026",
                "Over the past decade it has become clear that fundamental strings are not the only fundamental degrees of freedom in string theory. D-branes are also part of the spectrum of fundamental states. In this paper we explore some possible effects of D-branes on early Universe string cosmology, starting with two key assumptions: firstly that the initial state of the Universe corresponded to a dense, hot gas in which all degrees of freedom were in thermal equilibrium, and secondly that the topology of the background space admits one-cycles. We argue by t duality that in this context the cosmological singularities are not present. We derive the equation of state of the brane gases and apply the results to suggest that, in an expanding background, the winding modes of fundamental strings will play the most important role at late times. In particular, we argue that the string winding modes will only allow four space-time \u2026",
                "To accommodate the observed accelerated expansion of the universe, one popular idea is to invoke a driving term in the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre equation of dark energy which must then comprise 70% of the present cosmological energy density. We propose an alternative interpretation which takes into account the entropy and temperature intrinsic to the horizon of the universe due to the information holographically stored there. Dark energy is thereby obviated and the acceleration is due to an entropic force naturally arising from the information storage on the horizon surface screen. We consider an additional quantitative approach inspired by surface terms in general relativity and show that this leads to the entropic accelerating universe.",
                "Brane gas cosmology (BGC) is an approach to M-theory cosmology in which the initial state of the Universe is taken to be small, dense and hot, with all fundamental degrees of freedom near thermal equilibrium. Such a starting point is in close analogy with the standard big bang (SBB) model. The topology of the Universe is assumed to be toroidal in all nine spatial dimensions and is filled with a gas of p-branes. The dynamics of winding modes allow, at most, three spatial dimensions to become large, thus explaining the origin of our macroscopic (3+1)-dimensional Universe. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of the loitering phase of BGC. We do so by including into the equations of motion that describe the dilaton gravity background some new equations which determine the annihilation of string winding modes into string loops. Specific solutions are found within the model that exhibit loitering, i.e., the Universe \u2026",
                "We study the cosmological implications of including angular motion in the Dirac\u2013Born\u2013Infeld brane inflation scenario. The non-canonical kinetic terms of the Dirac\u2013Born\u2013Infeld action give an interesting alternative to slow-roll inflation, and cycling branes can drive periods of accelerated expansion in the Universe. We present explicit numerical solutions demonstrating brane inflation in the Klebanov\u2013Strassler throat. We find that demanding sufficient inflation takes place in the throat is in conflict with keeping the brane\u2019s total energy low enough that local gravitational back-reaction on the Calabi\u2013Yau manifold can be safely ignored. We deduce that spinflation (brane inflation with angular momentum) can ease this tension by providing extra e-foldings at the start of inflation. Cosmological expansion rapidly damps the angular momentum causing an exit to a more conventional brane inflation scenario. Finally, we set up a \u2026",
                "Modified gravitational theories can provide alternatives to dark energy as an explaination for the observed late-time cosmic acceleration. Several examples of low-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action are studied. These models generically contain unstable de Sitter solutions and, depending on the parameters of the theory, can exhibit late time accelerating attractor solutions.",
                "Reheating is a transition era after the end of inflation, during which the inflaton is converted into the particles that populate the Universe at later times. No direct cosmological observables are normally traceable to this period of reheating. Indirect bounds can however be derived. One possibility is to consider cosmological evolution for observable CMB scales from the time of Hubble crossing to the present time. Depending upon the model, the duration and final temperature after reheating, as well as its equation of state, may be directly linked to inflationary observables. For single-field inflationary models, if we approximate reheating by a constant equation of state, one can derive relations between the reheating duration (or final temperature), its equation of state parameter, and the scalar power spectrum amplitude and spectral index. While this is a simple approximation, by restricting the equation of state to lie within \u2026",
                "One of the major pillars of modern cosmology theory is a period of accelerating expansion in the early universe. This accelerating expansion, or inflation, must be sustained for at least 30 e-foldings. One mechanism used to drive the acceleration is the addition of a new energy field, called the inflaton; often this is a scalar field. We propose an alternative mechanism which, like our approach to explain the late-time accelerating universe, uses the entropy and temperature intrinsic to information holographically stored on a surface enclosing the observed space. The acceleration is due in both cases to an emergent entropic force, naturally arising from the information storage on the horizon."
