                "Electron-hole excitation and relaxation in the bulk, at interfaces, and surfaces of solid state materials play a key role in a variety of physical and chemical phenomena that are important for surface photochemistry, particle-surface interactions, and device physics. Information on charge carrier relaxation in metals can be obtained through analysis of linewidths measured by photoemission and related techniques, which give an estimate of the upper limit for electron and hole relaxation; however, many factors can contribute to spectral broadening, thus it is difficult to extract specific information on electronic relaxation processes. With femtosecond lasers it is possible to probe directly in a time-resolved fashion the charge carrier dynamics in metals by a variety of linear and nonlinear optical techniques. Femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoemission has attracted particularly strong interest because it incorporates \u2026",
                "Light interacting with nanostructured metals excites the collective charge density fluctuations known as surface plasmons (SP). Through excitation of the localized SP eigenmodes incident light is trapped on the nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal scales and its field is enhanced. Here we demonstrate the imaging and quantum control of SP dynamics in a nanostructured silver film. By inducing and imaging the nonlinear two-photon photoemission from the sample with a pair of identical 10-fs laser pulses while scanning the pulse delay, we record a movie of SP fields at a rate of 330-attoseconds\/frame.

                "The dynamics of cesium atom motion above the copper(111) surface following electronic excitation with light was studied with femtosecond (10\u201315 seconds) time resolution. Unusual changes in the surface electronic structure within 160 femtoseconds after excitation, observed by time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy, are attributed to atomic motion in a copper\u2013cesium bond-breaking process. Describing the change in energy of the cesium antibonding state with a simple classical model provides information on the mechanical forces acting on cesium atoms that are \u201cturned on\u201d by photoexcitation. Within 160 femtoseconds, the copper\u2013cesium bond extends by 0.35 angstrom from its equilibrium value.",
                "We present a unified ab initio study of electronic and optical properties of TiO 2 rutile and anatase phases with a combination of density-functional theory and many-body perturbation-theory techniques. The consistent treatment of exchange and correlation, with the inclusion of many-body one-particle and two-particles effects in self-energy and electron-hole interaction, produces a high-quality description of electronic and optical properties, giving, for some quantities, the first available estimation for this compound. In particular, we give a quantitative estimate of the electronic and direct optical gaps, clarifying their role with respect to previous measurements obtained by various experimental techniques. We obtain a description for both electronic gap and optical spectra that is consistent with experiments by analyzing the role of different contributions to the experimental optical gap and relating them to the level of \u2026",
                "The atomic electron orbitals that underlie molecular bonding originate from the central Coulomb potential of the atomic core. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory to explore the relation between the nearly spherical shape and unoccupied electronic structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) molecules adsorbed on copper surfaces. Besides the known \u03c0* antibonding molecular orbitals of the carbon-atom framework, above 3.5 electron volts we found atomlike orbitals bound to the core of the hollow C60 cage. These \u201csuperatom\u201d states hybridize like the s and p orbitals of hydrogen and alkali atoms into diatomic molecule-like dimers and free-electron bands of one-dimensional wires and two-dimensional quantum wells in C60 aggregates. We attribute the superatom states to the central potential binding an electron to its screening charge, a property expected for hollow-shell molecules \u2026"

Mellon Professor G01 Allen Hall (412) 624-3599 petek@pitt.edu Carrier dynamics in solid\u2013state materials Fundamental electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of solid\u2013state materials are determined by the dynamical response of carriers to internal and external fields. The near\u2013equilibrium properties of carriers in most materials are well understood from classical studies of transport and optical conductivity. However, due to strong interactions of carriers among themselves and with the lattice, studies of nonequlibrium dynamics on femtosecond time scales (10 \u2013 15 s) are just emerging. In our group, a particularly versatile and powerful technique, time\u2013resolved two\u2013photon photoemission (TR\u20132PP) spectroscopy, has been developed for studying the carrier excitation and relaxation processes in solid\u2013state materials. With this technique we are investigating the quantum mechanical phase and carrier population relaxation times in metals, and for intrinsic and adsorbate induced surface states on metals. Of particular interest are the physical processes that induce e\u2013h pair decoherence, since they impose limits on time scales for quantum control of carriers through the optical phase of the excitation light. The manipulation of the carrier phase with light may lead to applications such as ultrafast (>10 THz) switching and information processing, as well as, atomic manipulation of matter, and therefore, it is of great interest for advanced technologies in the 21st century. Ultrafast microscopy Understanding of the carrier dynamics under quantum confinement is a key to advancing nanoscale science and technology. Although with the existing scanning probe techniques we can potentially study dynamics of individual nanostructures, there is also a clear need for ultrafast imaging microscopic techniques in studies of dynamics in complex systems of nanostructures that could comprise ultrafast electronic or optical device. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is a well\u2013developed surface science technique for imaging nanostructures on metal and semiconductor surfaces. In combination with femtosecond pump\u2013probe excitation, we intend to develop time\u2013resolved PEEM with potentially <1 fs, <20 nm, <100 meV carrier energy resolution. This technique will be applied to fundamental studies of carrier dynamics in individual nanostructures and coupled nanocomposite systems, in order to understand the fundamental physics of hot carriers in low dimensional systems and to develop advanced device concepts. Atomic manipulation with light Electronic excitation of clean or adsorbate covered metal surfaces can impulsively turn\u2013on large mechanical forces that lead to mass transport parallel or perpendicular to the surface. When such forces are harnessed properly, they can be used for atomic manipulation or even atomic switching. Although there are now several examples of atomic manipulation with STM techniques, much less is known about how equivalent, but much larger scale manipulation could be accomplished with light. The recent observation and demonstration of quantum control of motion of Cs atoms above a Cu(111) surface by our group provides a proof\u2013of\u2013principle for the atomic manipulation of surfaces with light. Such studies are being extended to identify the factors that govern the electronic relaxation of adsorbates on metal surfaces, which can effectively quench the nuclear motion.
