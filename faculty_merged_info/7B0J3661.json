                "Anthony H. Duncan Professor Emeritus 400 Allen Hall (412) 624-9054 had@pitt.edu My research centers on the theory of strong interaction of elementary particles based on interaction of quarks and gluons, now referred to as quantum chromodynamics. The solution of this theory (e.g. to extract masses and properties of strongly interacting particles such as mesons and baryons) requires intensive computer calculations which exploit the Feynman sum over histories approach to quantum theory as well as a discrete space\u2013time representation of the quark and gluon fields in the theory (\"lattice quantum chromodynamics\").
