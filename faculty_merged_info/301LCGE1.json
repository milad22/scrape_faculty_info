                "This qualitative study addresses the link between urban high school teachers\u2019 beliefs about their students\u2019 preparedness to achieve success in science and the teachers\u2019 reported curricular responses to those beliefs. Eight high school science teachers from schools representing a range of achievement levels were interviewed using semistructured, in-depth interview techniques. The findings suggest that teachers view science as a special subject that requires special qualities. Teachers saw their own students as largely lacking in those qualities needed for success in science and reported such modifications to the curriculum as \u201cslowing down,\u201d deemphasizing some topics, and reducing the depth of coverage.",
                "Studies on physics identity are appearing more frequently and often responding to increased awareness of the underrepresentation of students of color in physics. In our broader research, we focus our efforts on understanding how racial identity and physics identity are negotiated throughout the experiences of Black physicists. In this paper, we present a Critical Physics Identity framework that can be used to examine racialized physics identity and demonstrate the utility of this framework by analyzing interviews with four physicists. Our framework draws from prior constructs of physics identity and racialized identity and provides operational definitions of six interacting dimensions. In this paper, we present the operationalized constructs, demonstrate how we use these constructs to code narrative data, as well as outline three methods of analysis that may be applied to study systems and structures and their influences \u2026"
