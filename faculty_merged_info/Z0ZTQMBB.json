                "Understanding the detailed relationship between nanoparticle structure and activity remains a significant challenge for the field of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. To this end, the structural and optical properties of individual plasmonic nanoantennas comprised of Au nanoparticle assemblies that are coated with organic reporter molecules and encapsulated by a SiO2 shell have been determined using correlated transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dark-field Rayleigh scattering microscopy, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) microscopy, and finite element method (FEM) calculations. The distribution of SERS enhancement factors (EFs) for a structurally and optically diverse set of nanoantennas is remarkably narrow. For a collection of 30 individual nanoantennas ranging from dimers to heptamers, the EFs vary by less than 2 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the EFs for the hot-spot \u2026",
                "  This Account provides an overview of the methods that are currently being used to study the electromagnetics of silver and gold nanoparticles, with an emphasis on the determination of extinction and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra. These methods have proven to be immensely useful in recent years for interpreting a wide range of nanoscience experiments and providing the capability to describe optical properties of particles up to several hundred nanometers in dimension, including arbitrary particle structures and complex dielectric environments (adsorbed layers of molecules, nearby metal films, and other particles). While some of the methods date back to Mie\u2019s celebrated work a century ago, others are still at the forefront of algorithm development in computational electromagnetics.This Account gives a qualitative description of the physical and mathematical basis behind the most \u2026",
                "The size-dependence of surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) is poorly understood in the small particle limit due to complex physical\/chemical effects and uncertainties in experimental samples. In this article, we report an approach for synthesizing an ideal class of colloidal Ag nanoparticles with highly uniform morphologies and narrow size distributions. Optical measurements and theoretical analyses for particle diameters in the d \u2248 2\u201320 nm range are presented. The SPR absorption band exhibits an exceptional behavior: As size decreases from d \u2248 20 nm it blue-shifts but then turns over near d \u2248 12 nm and strongly red-shifts. A multilayer Mie theory model agrees well with the observations, indicating that lowered electron conductivity in the outermost atomic layer, due to chemical interactions, is the cause of the red-shift. We corroborate this picture by experimentally demonstrating precise chemical control of the \u2026",
                "Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the Universe. They are also, in principle, the most simple. Nonetheless, they display remarkable properties under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature that have fascinated theoreticians and experimentalists for over a century. Advances in computational methods have made it possible to elucidate ever more of their properties. Some of these methods that have been applied in recent years, in particular, those that perform simulations directly from the physical picture of electrons and ions, such as density functional theory and quantum Monte Carlo are reviewed. The predictions from such methods as applied to the phase diagram of hydrogen, with particular focus on the solid phases and the liquid-liquid transition are discussed. The predictions of ordered quantum states, including the possibilities of a low-or zero-temperature quantum fluid and high \u2026",
                "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs), resulting from the interaction of light with metal nanoparticles, are powerful tools for biological sensors, surface-enhanced spectroscopies, and optical devices. LSPR frequencies are strongly dependent on a nanoparticle\u2019s structure, composition, and local dielectric environment. However, these relationships are prohibitively difficult or impossible to probe from bulk solutions due to the heterogeneity of chemically synthesized products. In this study, systematic single-particle structure\u2212property measurements, coupled with a statistical analysis and FDTD calculations, are performed on silver and gold nanocubes. The dependencies of LSPR frequencies on nanocube size, composition, and substrate dielectric constant are determined. The results obtained represent the most quantitative measurements and analysis to date, yielding predictive rules and fundamental \u2026",
                "We present an implementation of Maxwell\u2019s equations that incorporates the spatially nonlocal response of materials, an effect necessary to describe the optical properties of structures with features less than 10 nm. For the first time it is possible to investigate the nonlocal optical response of structures without spherical or planar shape, and outside of the electrostatic limit. As an illustration, we calculate the optical properties of Au nanowires and show that nonlocal effects are particularly important in structures with apex features, even for arbitrarily large sizes.",
                "We discuss how the poor metals Al, Ga, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, and Bi can be used for plasmonics in the near to far ultraviolet (UV) range, similar to the noble metals Ag and Au in the visible (Vis) range. We first discuss the empirical dielectric functions of the poor metals, contrasting them with Ag and Au, and also fitting them to a Drude and multiple Lorentz oscillator form. Using Mie theory, we then compare the optical responses of spherical poor metal nanoparticles to noble metal ones. Finally, nanoparticle dimers are studied using a vectorial finite element method. We show how the poor metals exhibit large electric field enhancements in the UV, comparable to Au in the Vis, which makes them particularly attractive for sensing applications, such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.",
                "Finite element method calculations were carried out to determine extinction spectra and the electromagnetic (EM) contributions to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for 90-nm Au nanoparticle dimers modeled after experimental nanotags. The calculations revealed that the EM properties depend significantly on the junction region, specifically the distance between the nanoparticles for spacings of less than 1 nm. For extinction spectra, spacings below 1 nm lead to maxima that are strongly red-shifted from the 600-nm plasmon maximum associated with an isolated nanoparticle. This result agrees qualitatively well with experimental transmission electron microscopy images and localized surface plasmon resonance spectra that are also presented. The calculations further revealed that spacings below 0.5 nm, and especially a slight fusing of the nanoparticles to give tiny crevices, leads to EM \u2026",
                "Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and diffraction effects such as Rayleigh anomalies (RAs) play key roles in the transmission of light through periodic subwavelength hole arrays in metal films. Using a combination of theory and experiment we show how refractive index (RI) sensitive transmission features arise from hole arrays in thin gold films.  We show that large transmission amplitude changes occur over a narrow range of RI values due to coupling between RAs and SPPs on opposite sides of the metal film.  Furthermore, we show how to predict, on the basis of a relatively simple analysis, the periodicity and other system parameters that should be used to achieve this \u201cRA-SPP\u201d effect for any desired RI range.",
                "The plasmonic properties of noble metal nanoparticles have potential uses in a wide variety of technologies, particularly sensing devices, based on their optical response. To better understand how nanoparticles can be incorporated in such devices, the detailed relationship between the optical response and structural properties of single nanoparticles is needed. Here we demonstrate that correlated localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements can be used to obtain the optical response and detailed structural information for a single nanoparticle, using a silver (Ag) nanocube as the example. By carefully incorporating the HRTEM structural details into finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electrodynamics calculations, excellent agreement with the LSPR measurements is obtained. The FDTD calculations show strong \u2026"
