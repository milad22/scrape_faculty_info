                "Skip to content Welcome Aboard! About Me Curriculum Vitae Teaching Contact Blog Danny Barringer's Website Welcome Aboard! I am currently a lecturer in the Physics department at Texas State, though I am an astronomer by training. I love teaching in general and am always looking for ways to do better by my students. I am broadly interested in curriculum development, games\u2014particularly video games\u2014as teaching tools, promoting equity and inclusion in physics and astronomy, informal learning spaces, and teaching ethics through science. My current non-teaching work involves expanding the astronomy offerings here at Texas State through the development of new courses. Menu Welcome Aboard!
