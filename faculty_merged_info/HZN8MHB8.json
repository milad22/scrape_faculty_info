CP violation was first observed in the decay of long lived neutral kaons. For decades CP violation was regarded as a small, poorly understood portion of the standard model. In recent years B factories have permitted to observation of CP violation in a large number of B meson decays. It is now a well understood portion of the standard model and well explained by the CKM mechanism. Neutrinos appear to have substantially more structure than originally expected. There are three different kinds of light neutrinos known. They appear to be unstable in that they can transform from one type to another. Several experiments are underway worldwide to explore neutrino mixing and to look for evidence of CP violation in the neutrino sector. Some of these experiments are being done with electron antineutrinos from nuclear reactors. This next generation of neutrino experiments demands high statistics and precision measurements to access the small theta 13 mixing angle. \u201cObservation of a Neutrino Burst in Coincidence with Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud,\u201d R.M.
