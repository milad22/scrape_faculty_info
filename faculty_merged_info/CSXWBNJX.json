                "A theory is presented for the fully\u2010developed flow of gas and particles in a vertical pipe. The relation between gas pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is predicted, over the whole range of cocurrent and countercurrent flows, together with velocity profiles for both phases and the radial concentration profile for the particles. The gas and the particles interact through a drag force depending on their relative velocity, and there are mutual interactions between pairs of particles through inelastic collisions. This model is shown to account for marked segregation of gas and particles in the radial direction, and the predicted relation between the pressure gradient and the flow rates of the two phases is surprisingly complex.",
                "ing equations of Ishii 1975 do not differ from those of Anderson and Jackson 1967 in terms of macroscopic flow beha\u00ae ior, but differ on a local scale. Flow predictions are not sensiti\u00ae e to the use of different solid stress models or radial distribution functions, as different approaches are\u00ae ery similar in dense flow regimes. The application of a different drag model, howe\u00ae er, significantly impacts the flow of the solids phase. A simplified algebraic granular energy-balance equation is proposed for determining the granular temperature, instead of sol\u00ae ing the full granular energy balance. This simplification does not lead to significantly different results, but it does reduce the computational effort of the simulations by about 20%.",
                "Numerous experimental investigations on the vertical transport of dense gas\u2013solid suspensions indicate that particles tend to segregate toward the tube wall. Although models based on the kinetic theory analogy can predict such patterns for perfectly elastic particle\u2010particle collisions, the predictive ability of these models breaks down for inelastic collisions. In the present effort, a mathematical model is developed that incorporates two mechanisms that give rise to the lateral segregation of solids: interactions associated with individual particles based on a kinetic theory treatment and interactions associated with collections of particles based on an analogy with single\u2010phase turbulent flows. Although these two mechanisms have been treated independently by previous workers, their combined contributions to the overall flow behavior have not been thoroughly investigated. The effect of such a treatment on the \u2026",
                "Accurate prediction of the discharge rate from hoppers is important in many industrial processes involving the handling of granular materials. The present work investigates the parameters affecting the discharge rate using the discrete element method (DEM). The effects of particle properties (particle size and size distribution) and hopper geometry (hopper width, outlet width, angle and fill height) are studied and compared to previously published experimental correlations. The results indicate that DEM simulations are fully capable of reproducing trends in the discharge rate that are well-known experimentally. For example, particle size and hopper width are shown to have a minimal influence on the discharge rate. In addition, for rectangular hoppers, the discharge rate is shown to vary with the outlet width raised to the 3 2 power as given by the modified Beverloo correlation. The DEM simulations are also used to \u2026",
                "In this work, the discrete element method (DEM) is used to assess powder flow from hoppers and the results are compared to widely-used hopper design charts. These design charts delineate mass-flow and funnel-flow behavior based on the hopper wall angle and a given set of material properties. The modeled system consists of hoppers with various wall angles and frictional, non-cohesive, spherical particles. The performance is assessed by measuring the particle residence times, particle velocities, and the extent of segregation during discharge. A Mass Flow Index (MFI) based on the velocity profile data is used to quantitatively characterize the nature of the flow pattern as mass-flow, funnel-flow, or some intermediate. The DEM predictions are generally in very good agreement with the Jenike design charts. The level of agreement shown here indicates that DEM cannot only reproduce the current estimates of \u2026",
                "Earlier work of Sinclair and Jackson that treats the laminar flow of gas\u2010solid suspensions is extended to model dilute turbulent flow. The random particle motion, often exceeding the turbulent flucutations in the gas, is obtained using a model based on the kinetic theory of granular materials. A two\u2010equation low Reynolds number turbulence model is modified to account for the presence of the dilute particle phase. Comparisons of the model predictions with available experimental data for the mean and fluctuating velocity profiles for both phases indicate that the resulting theory captures many of the flow features observed in the pneumatic transport of large particles. THe model predictions did not manifest an exterme sensitivity to the degree of inelasticity in the particle\u2010particle collisions for the range of solid loading ratios investigated.",
                "The segregation of granular materials due to differences in particle properties occurs during a variety of handling and transport processes, such as flow from a hopper. In the present work, the discrete element method (DEM) is used to investigate segregation of granular materials during discharge from a hopper. The effects of various particle properties and hopper geometries on the segregation of a spherical, bidisperse granular material during hopper discharge are studied. Particle contacts are modeled using a soft-particle model consisting of a hysteretic spring system and sliding friction. The effects of the particle diameter ratio, density ratio, fines mass fraction, hopper wall angle, hopper cross-sectional shape, and the initial fill conditions are investigated.These computational results are compared to those from a small experimental system with the same hopper dimensions and particle properties. The use of this \u2026",
                "Granular materials may segregate upon processing and handling based on differences in particle properties such as size, density, or shape. In most instances, this segregation is problematic in that product quality is usually dependent on maintaining homogeneity of the blend. The present work investigates the causes and extent of segregation of granular materials during discharge from a hopper using the discrete element method. A quasi-three-dimensional, wedge-shaped hopper is modeled using two parallel periodic boundary conditions. The effects of various particle properties, such as diameter ratio, mean size, and mass fraction of each species, as well as hopper geometries, such as the height, width, outlet width, and wall angle, on the segregation results are examined. Additionally, the effects of friction coefficient and hopper fill methods are investigated. Results show that many factors affect the extent of \u2026",
                "This review article focuses on the modeling of complex granular flows employing the discrete element method (DEM) approach. The specific topic discussed is the application of DEM models for the study of the flow behavior of nonspherical, flexible, or cohesive particles, including particle breakage. The major sources of particle cohesion\u2014liquid induced, electrostatics, van der Waals forces\u2014and their implementation into DEM simulations are covered. These aspects of particle flow are of great importance in practical applications and hence are the significant foci of research at the forefront of current DEM modeling efforts. For example, DEM simulations of nonspherical grains can provide particle stress information needed to develop constitutive models for continuum-based simulations of large-scale industrial processes.",
                "A computational fluid dynamics model was developed for gas\u2010solid fluidized beds containing a mixture of two particle species. To calculate stresses of the solid phase, the kinetic theory of granular flow was extended to consider a binary mixture of smooth, nearly elastic, spheres. The developed model was simulated to demonstrate key features of binary mixture fluidization. Bed expansion with a binary mixture of different size particles, but with identical densities, was much higher than that of a system consisting of mono\u2010sized particles of the same mean size as the bimodal mixture. Minimum fluidization velocity for the binary particle system was significantly lowered. The mixing behavior of the binary mixture of particles, characterized by the mixing index, increased with increasing superficial gas velocity. For a binary mixture of particles of larger size with lower density and smaller size with higher density, larger \u2026"
