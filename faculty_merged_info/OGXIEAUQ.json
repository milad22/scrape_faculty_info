                "About Dr. Sanchez Group Members Funding Francisco Muller Sanchez Francisco Muller Sanchez Assistant Professor, Department of Physics and Materials Science 901.678.2620 f.muller.sanchez@memphis.edu Office: Manning 328 \/ Lab: Manning 428 12-3 Mon-Thurs, 3-5 Fri Biography Prof. Muller-Sanchez is an observational astronomer with a broad interest in extragalactic\n                  astronomy. His research focuses on galaxy formation and evolution, with interests\n                  ranging from\u00a0the\u00a0physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and nuclear star\n                  clusters,\u00a0to the role of\u00a0supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy evolution, galaxy\n                  mergers and the cosmic\u00a0evolution of the relations between the central black hole\u00a0and\n                  its host galaxy. He uses multiwavelength\u00a0analyses for these studies, with a focus\n                  on the optical\/near-IR and radio regimes. Dr. Muller-Sanchez joined UofM's physics department in Fall 2018 to help expand the\n                  astrophysics program. Through the introduction of new astronomy and astrophysics courses\n                  over the last year, we now have an astronomy concentration as of Spring 2019 Education Dr. Muller-Sanchez received his Ph.D. degree in Physics and Astronomy from the\u00a0Ludwig\n                  Maximilians University in Munich (LMU), working at the\u00a0Max-Planck Institut for Extraterrestrial\n                  Physics (MPE)\u00a0in Garching, Germany. Prior to his arrival in Memphis, he spent three\n                  years as a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC)\u00a0in\n                  Spain, two years as postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0University of California Los Angeles\n                  (UCLA), and five years as research associate at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
