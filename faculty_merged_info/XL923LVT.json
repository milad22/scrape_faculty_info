                "Charles Kerton Associate Professor Astronomy Dr. Kerton received his Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Toronto in 2000. After graduating he was a postdoctoral research associate for three years at the National Research Council of Canada working on the International Galactic Plane Survey. In 2003 he joined the faculty at Iowa State.  His research is in the area of observational studies of star formation and the physics of the interstellar medium and makes use of a wide variety of observational facilities ranging from the enormous 110-m diameter Green Bank radio telescope to the 0.8-m orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope in the infrared. kerton@iastate.edu 515-294-2298 Ph.D., University of Toronto, 2000 More Information Recent Publications Lundquist, M.J., Kobulnicky, H.A., Alexander, M.J., Kerton, C.R., \u00a0& Arvidsson, K. 2015, A 13CO Survey of Intermediate-mass Star-forming Regions, ApJ, 806, 40 Kerton, C.R., Wolf-Chase, G., Arvidsson, K., Lintott, C.J., & Simpson, R.
