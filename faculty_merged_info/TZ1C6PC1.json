Theoretical Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, 1\/1980   Description of Research  Summary Statement of Research Interests  Professor Nemeschansky has been studying quantum field theory and string theory and their application to unification of forces. Recently he has been working on strong weak coupling duality in supersymmetric QCD. He has also been studying duality in string theory. Recently he has constructed several example of string theories that are dual to each other.  Publications  Book   Bars, I., Nemeschansky, D., Pilch, K., Saleur, H. M., Warner, N.
