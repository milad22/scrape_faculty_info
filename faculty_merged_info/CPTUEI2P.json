                "Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton\u2013proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, W+ W\u2212, \u03c4+ \u03c4\u2212, and b b\u00af. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3\u00b10.4 (stat.)\u00b10.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",
                "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (1027 cm\u22122 s\u22121). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4\u03c0 solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|\u03b7| \u2264 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.",
                "Measurements of the jet energy calibration and transverse momentum resolution in CMS are presented, performed with a data sample collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36pb\u2212 1. The transverse momentum balance in dijet and \u03b3\/Z+ jets events is used to measure the jet energy response in the CMS detector, as well as the transverse momentum resolution. The results are presented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-based approach, the``Jet-Plus-Track''approach, which improves the measurement of calorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks, and the``Particle Flow''approach, which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in the event, prior to the jet clustering, based on information from all relevant subdetectors.",
                "Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Comprehensive sets of production and decay measurements are combined. The decay channels include,,,,, and pairs. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 at 7 and up to 19.7 at 8. From the high-resolution and channels, the mass of the Higgs boson is determined to be. For this mass value, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay channels and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal relative to the standard model expectation is at the measured mass. The couplings of the Higgs boson are probed \u2026",
                "New sets of parameters (\u201ctunes\u201d) for the underlying-event (UE) modelling of the pythia 8, pythia6 and herwig++ Monte Carlo event generators are constructed using different parton distribution functions. Combined fits to CMS UE proton\u2013proton () data at and to UE proton\u2013antiproton () data from the CDF experiment at lower, are used to study the UE models and constrain their parameters, providing thereby improved predictions for proton\u2013proton collisions at 13. In addition, it is investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons are presented of the UE tunes to \u201cminimum bias\u201d(MB) events, multijet, and Drell\u2013Yan ( lepton-antilepton+ jets) observables at 7 and 8, as well as predictions for MB and UE observables at 13 \u2026",
                "This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system during the LHC Run 1 are described.",
                "A detailed description is reported of the analysis used by the CMS Collaboration in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at the LHC, which led to the observation of a new boson. The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities up to 5.1 fb\u2212 1 at TeV, and up to 5.3 fb\u2212 1 at TeV. The results for five Higgs boson decay modes \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, \u03c4\u03c4, and bb, which show a combined local significance of 5 standard deviations near 125 GeV, are reviewed. A fit to the invariant mass of the two high resolution channels, \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ\u2192 4\u2113, gives a mass estimate of 125. 3\u00b10. 4 (stat.)\u00b10. 5 (syst.) GeV. The measurements are interpreted in the context of the standard model Lagrangian for the scalar Higgs field interacting with fermions and vector bosons. The measured values of the corresponding couplings are compared to the standard model predictions. The hypothesis of custodial symmetry is \u2026",
                "Measurements of inclusive W and Z boson production cross sections in pp collisions at sqrt (s)= 7 TeV are presented, based on 2.9 inverse picobarns of data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurements, performed in the electron and muon decay channels, are combined to give sigma (pp to WX) times B (W to muon or electron+ neutrino)= 9.95\\pm 0.07 (stat.)\\pm 0.28 (syst.)\\pm 1.09 (lumi.) nb and sigma (pp to ZX) times B (Z to oppositely charged muon or electron pairs)= 0.931\\pm 0.026 (stat.)\\pm 0.023 (syst.)\\pm 0.102 (lumi.) nb. Theoretical predictions, calculated at the next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD using recent parton distribution functions, are in agreement with the measured cross sections. Ratios of cross sections, which incur an experimental systematic uncertainty of less than 4%, are also reported.",
                "CMS is a general purpose experiment, designed to study the physics of pp collisions at 14 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007.",
                "Modern general-purpose detectors at high-energy colliders are based on the concept of cylindrical detection layers, nested around the beam axis. Starting from the beam interaction region, particles first enter a tracker, in which charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and origins (vertices) are reconstructed from signals (hits) in the sensitive layers. The tracker is immersed in a magnetic field that bends the trajectories and allows the electric charges and momenta of charged particles to be measured. Electrons and photons are then absorbed in an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The corresponding electromagnetic showers are detected as clusters of energy recorded in neighbouring cells, from which the energy and direction of the particles can be determined. Charged and neutral hadrons may initiate a hadronic shower in the ECAL as well, which is subsequently fully absorbed in the hadron calorimeter (HCAL \u2026"
