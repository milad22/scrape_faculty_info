                "The mechanical features of biological muscles are difficult to reproduce completely in synthetic systems. A new class of soft pneumatic structures (vacuum\u2010actuated muscle\u2010inspired pneumatic structures) is described that combines actuation by negative pressure (vacuum), with cooperative buckling of beams fabricated in a slab of elastomer, to achieve motion and demonstrate many features that are similar to that of mammalian muscle.",
                "Rapid detection of pathogens is crucial to minimize adverse health impacts of nosocomial, foodborne, and waterborne diseases. Gold nanoparticles are extremely successful at detecting pathogens due to their ability to provide a simple and rapid color change when their environment is altered. Here, we review general strategies of implementing gold nanoparticles in colorimetric biosensors. First, we highlight how gold nanoparticles have improved conventional genomic analysis methods by lowering detection limits while reducing assay times. Then, we focus on emerging point-of-care technologies that aim at pathogen detection using simpler assays. These advances will facilitate the implementation of gold nanoparticle-based biosensors in diverse environments throughout the world and help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.",
                "Nanoparticles (NPs) formulated using self-assembly of block copolymers have attracted significant attention as nano-scaled drug delivery vehicles. Here we report the development of a biodegradable NP using self-assembly of a linear amphiphilic block copolymer, Dex-b-PLA, composed of poly(D,L-lactide), and dextran. The size of the NPs can be precisely tuned between 15 and 70 nm by altering the molecular weight (M W) of the two polymer chains. Using doxorubicin as a model drug, we demonstrated that the NPs can carry up to 21% (w\/w) of the drug payload. The release profile of doxorubicin from NPs showed sustained release for over 6 days. Using a rat model, we explored the pharmacokinetics profiles of Dex-b-PLA NPs, and showed proof-of-concept that long circulation lifetime of the NPs can be achieved by tuning the M W of Dex-b-PLA block copolymer.

                "Medical imaging technologies allow for the rapid diagnosis and evaluation of a wide range of pathologies. In order to increase their sensitivity and utility, many imaging technologies such as CT and MRI rely on intravenously administered contrast agents. While the current generation of contrast agents has enabled rapid diagnosis, they still suffer from many undesirable drawbacks including a lack of tissue specificity and systemic toxicity issues. Through advances made in nanotechnology and materials science, researchers are now creating a new generation of contrast agents that overcome many of these challenges, and are capable of providing more sensitive and specific information. In this review, we summarize the main classes of nanotechnology-based contrast agents for each of the major imaging technologies, and highlight progress in their development as well as the challenges to be addressed. We also review the relevant biological interactions that determine the in vivo fate of these contrast agents, and describe major themes in medical nanotechnology including stealth and targeting.",
                "This article describes a 3D microfluidic paper-based analytical device that can be used to conduct an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The device comprises two parts: a sliding strip (which contains the active sensing area) and a structure surrounding the sliding strip (which holds stored reagents\u2014buffers, antibodies, and enzymatic substrate\u2014and distributes fluid). Running an ELISA involves adding sample (e.g. blood) and water, moving the sliding strip at scheduled times, and analyzing the resulting color in the sensing area visually or using a flatbed scanner. We demonstrate that this device can be used to detect C-reactive protein (CRP)\u2014a biomarker for neonatal sepsis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases\u2014at a concentration range of 1\u2013100 ng\/mL in 1000-fold diluted blood (1\u2013100 \u00b5g\/mL in undiluted blood).

                "The recent increases in food prices caused by the corresponding increases in fertilizer costs have highlighted the demand for reducing the overuse of fertilizers in industrial agriculture. There has been increasing interest in developing plant root-targeted delivery (RTD) of fertilizers in order to address the problem of inefficient fertilizer use. The aim of this study is to develop a low cost controlled release device to deliver fertilizers to plant roots and thereby increase fertilizer use efficiency. The Root Targeted Delivery Vehicle (RTDV) is formed by dissolving Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) chains in water, mixing it with liquid fertilizer and crosslinking using iron and calcium salts. Basic measurements quantifying nutrient release and green house growth trials were carried out to evaluate fertilizer use efficiency on wheat growing in nutrient depleted soil media. Growing wheat in nutrient depleted media showed that the RTDV permits a 78% reduction in the amount of fertilizer needed to achieve similar levels of plant yield in these conditions. Quantifying the losses associated with the RTDV synthesis showed that optimizing manufacturing could possibly increase this value as high as 94%. Furthermore, the delivery device showed a similar lifetime in soil to the plant\u2019s growth cycle, delivering fertilizer over the course of the plant\u2019s growth before removal from soil by degradation. These results illustrate the importance of fertilizer delivery in facilitating absorption and may have potential to vastly increase the use efficiency of fertilizers in soil, resulting in a significant reduction of costs and environmental damage. With more in depth study to quantify the fertilizer \u2026",
                "Rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria is challenging because conventional methods require long incubation times. Nanoparticles have the potential to detect pathogens before they can cause an infection. Gold nanostars have recently been used for colorimetric biosensors but they typically require surface modification with antibodies or aptamers for cellular detection. Here, CTAB-coated gold nanostars have been used to rapidly (<5 min) detect infective doses of a model Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus by an instrument-free colorimetric method. Varying the amounts of gold nanoseed precursor and surfactant can tune the size and degree of branching of gold nanostars as studied here by transmission electron microscopy. The size and morphology of gold nanostars determine the degree and rate of color change in the presence of S. aureus. The optimal formulation achieved maximum color \u2026",
                "Soft linear actuators are useful for making collaborative machines (eg, machines that interact safely with people in continuous, transitory, intentional, and incidental contact) and in designing biomimetic robots based on animals. Here, a new type of soft linear actuator that uses negative pressure (vacuum) for its actuation and generates a mechanical advantage to amplify force is demonstrated.",
                "This article demonstrates a pneumatically actuated soft robot capable of navigating the inside of a tube. This robot was built using buckling pneumatic actuators (vacuum-actuated muscle-inspired pneumatic structures, or VAMPs). The tube climber can navigate through a tube with turns, inclines, and varying diameters. The robot is also able to remove obstacles (of more than 10 times its own weight) from tubes to perform a clearing function. It maintains climbing and clearing performance in wet conditions and under water. The tube climber is lightweight and completely soft and thus has the potential to be collaborative (i.e., work with humans) and also to interact safely with delicate environments.",
                "Topical formulations, commonly applied for treatment of anterior eye diseases, require frequent administration due to rapid clearance from the ocular surface, typically through the lacrimal drainage system or through over-spillage onto the lids. We report on a mucoadhesive nanoparticle drug delivery system that may be used to prolong the precorneal residence time of encapsulated drugs. The nanoparticles were formed from self-assembly of block copolymers composed of poly(d, l-lactide) and Dextran. The enhanced mucoadhesion properties were achieved by surface functionalizing the nanoparticles with phenylboronic acid. The nanoparticles encapsulated up to 12 wt.% of Cyclosporine A (CycA) and sustained the release for up to five days at a clinically relevant dose, which led us to explore the therapeutic efficacy of the formulation with reduced administration frequency.
