                "The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers\u223c 99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of\u223c 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision \u2026",
                "We report the draft genome of the black cottonwood tree, Populus trichocarpa. Integration of shotgun sequence assembly with genetic mapping enabled chromosome-scale reconstruction of the genome. More than 45,000 putative protein-coding genes were identified. Analysis of the assembled genome revealed a whole-genome duplication event; about 8000 pairs of duplicated genes from that event survived in the Populus genome. A second, older duplication event is indistinguishably coincident with the divergence of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages. Nucleotide substitution, tandem gene duplication, and gross chromosomal rearrangement appear to proceed substantially more slowly in Populus than in Arabidopsis. Populus has more protein-coding genes than Arabidopsis, ranging on average from 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene. However, the relative frequency of protein \u2026",
                "The number of sequenced plant genomes and associated genomic resources is growing rapidly with the advent of both an increased focus on plant genomics from funding agencies, and the application of inexpensive next generation sequencing. To interact with this increasing body of data, we have developed Phytozome (http:\/\/www.phytozome.net), a comparative hub for plant genome and gene family data and analysis. Phytozome provides a view of the evolutionary history of every plant gene at the level of sequence, gene structure, gene family and genome organization, while at the same time providing access to the sequences and functional annotations of a growing number (currently 25) of complete plant genomes, including all the land plants and selected algae sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute, as well as selected species sequenced elsewhere. Through a comprehensive plant genome \u2026",
                "Sorghum, an African grass related to sugar cane and maize, is grown for food, feed, fibre and fuel. We present an initial analysis of the\u223c 730-megabase Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench genome, placing\u223c 98% of genes in their chromosomal context using whole-genome shotgun sequence validated by genetic, physical and syntenic information. Genetic recombination is largely confined to about one-third of the sorghum genome with gene order and density similar to those of rice. Retrotransposon accumulation in recombinationally recalcitrant heterochromatin explains the\u223c 75% larger genome size of sorghum compared with rice. Although gene and repetitive DNA distributions have been preserved since palaeopolyploidization\u223c 70 million years ago, most duplicated gene sets lost one member before the sorghum\u2013rice divergence. Concerted evolution makes one duplicated chromosomal segment appear to be only \u2026",
                "Microbial communities are vital in the functioning of all ecosystems; however, most microorganisms are uncultivated, and their roles in natural systems are unclear. Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The \u2026",
                "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga whose lineage diverged from land plants over 1 billion years ago. It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced the \u223c120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.",
                "Diatoms are unicellular algae with plastids acquired by secondary endosymbiosis. They are responsible for \u223c20% of global carbon fixation. We report the 34 million\u2013base pair draft nuclear genome of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and its 129 thousand\u2013base pair plastid and 44 thousand\u2013base pair mitochondrial genomes. Sequence and optical restriction mapping revealed 24 diploid nuclear chromosomes. We identified novel genes for silicic acid transport and formation of silica-based cell walls, high-affinity iron uptake, biosynthetic enzymes for several types of polyunsaturated fatty acids, use of a range of nitrogenous compounds, and a complete urea cycle, all attributes that allow diatoms to prosper in aquatic environments.",
                "The compact genome of Fugu rubripes has been sequenced to over 95% coverage, and more than 80% of the assembly is in multigene-sized scaffolds. In this 365-megabase vertebrate genome, repetitive DNA accounts for less than one-sixth of the sequence, and gene loci occupy about one-third of the genome. As with the human genome, gene loci are not evenly distributed, but are clustered into sparse and dense regions. Some \u201cgiant\u201d genes were observed that had average coding sequence sizes but were spread over genomic lengths significantly larger than those of their human orthologs. Although three-quarters of predicted human proteins have a strong match toFugu, approximately a quarter of the human proteins had highly diverged from or had no pufferfish homologs, highlighting the extent of protein evolution in the 450 million years since teleosts and mammals diverged. Conserved linkages between \u2026",
                "The first chordates appear in the fossil record at the time of the Cambrian explosion, nearly 550 million years ago. The modern ascidian tadpole represents a plausible approximation to these ancestral chordates. To illuminate the origins of chordate and vertebrates, we generated a draft of the protein-coding portion of the genome of the most studied ascidian, Ciona intestinalis. TheCiona genome contains \u223c16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates. Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development. The ascidian genome has also acquired a number of lineage-specific innovations, including a group of genes engaged in cellulose metabolism that are related to those in bacteria and fungi.",
                "Lancelets (\u2018amphioxus\u2019) are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage, with a fossil record dating back to the Cambrian period. Here we describe the structure and gene content of the highly polymorphic\u223c 520-megabase genome of the Florida lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, and analyse it in the context of chordate evolution. Whole-genome comparisons illuminate the murky relationships among the three chordate groups (tunicates, lancelets and vertebrates), and allow not only reconstruction of the gene complement of the last common chordate ancestor but also partial reconstruction of its genomic organization, as well as a description of two genome-wide duplications and subsequent reorganizations in the vertebrate lineage. These genome-scale events shaped the vertebrate genome and provided additional genetic variation for exploitation during vertebrate evolution."

                "Daniel Rokhsar Daniel Rokhsar 525H LSA dsrokhsar@gmail.com (510) 642-8314 My interests center on collective phenomena and ordering in condensed matter and biological systems. In the past, I have worked on high-temperature superconductivity, quantum antiferromagnetism, the fullerenes, and liquid crystals. My current interests include the theoretical and computational modeling of molecular, cellular, and collective properties of biological systems, as well as the behavior of quantum fluids like cold atomic gases and high temperature superconductors. Current Projects The mammalian visual system is a complex system that is \"self -organizing,\" in the sense that the connections between cells in the retina and brain arise spontaneously in the developing animal. These organized connections are not \"hard-wired,\" but instead arise from a complex program of intercellular signalling. In particular, as the retina develops, it exhibits spontaneous electrical activity which propagates across patches in a wave-like manner; these waves have been implicated in the formation of ordered maps between the retina and the cortex. In collaboration with neuroscientists Marla Feller and Carla Shatz, Dan Butts and I have developed models for the interactions between cells in the developing retina. Our goal is both to model the specific behavior of the developing ferret retina for close comparisons with experiment, and to use such models to better understand the principles that govern real neural networks and systems. The three-dimensional structure of a protein is typically specified by its amino acid sequence. This three-dimensional folded or \"native\" structure, in turn, allows the protein to fulfill its biological function, which may be enzymatic, structural, mechanical, etc. For many proteins, the folded structure is the equilibrium state under physiological conditions, and they are typically stable by 5 -15 kT. By heating them, changing the pH, or adding certain chemicals to the water in which they are dissolved, proteins can be unfolded in a \"cooperative\" or first-order transition. When such unfolded or \"denatured\" proteins are returned to physiological conditions, refolding typically occurs rapidly (on the order of milliseconds) and reproducibly. How does this process occur? What are there general principles by which proteins can find their stable folded states? How is this information encoded in their sequence? To answer these questions, Vijay Pande, Nik Putnam, Jarrod Chapman and I are developing and studying models that range from simplified lattice polymers to complete molecular dynamics with solvent, as well as new analysis techniques to characterize the folding process. I am also interested in the behavior of quantum mechanically degenerate atomic vapors in confined geometries, including both Fermi and Bose systems. Unlike liquid 4He, the recently discovered atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are dilute, compressible systems confined by inhomogeneous trap potentials. How are the properties of a Bose condensate affected by an external potential? How will it respond to external probes? What sorts of vortex states are possible? Can interactions and\/or disorder destroy the Bose condensate? Are they superfluids?"
