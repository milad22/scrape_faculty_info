                "It is shown that a wide class of non-Abelian gauge theories have, up to calculable logarithmic corrections, free-field-theory asymptotic behavior. It is suggested that Bjorken scaling may be obtained from strong-interaction dynamics based on non-Abelian gauge symmetry.",
                "The requirement that P and T be approximately conserved in the color gauge theory of strong interactions without arbitrary adjustment of parameters is analyzed. Several possibilities are identified, including one which would give a remarkable new kind of very light, long-lived pseudoscalar boson.",
                "An introduction to modern physics and to Richard Feynman at his witty and enthusiastic best, discussing gravitation, irreversibility, symmetry, and the nature of scientific discovery. Richard Feynman was one of the most famous and important physicists of the second half of the twentieth century. Awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965, celebrated for his spirited and engaging lectures, and briefly a star on the evening news for his presence on the commission investigating the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, Feynman is best known for his contributions to the field of quantum electrodynamics. The Character of Physical Law, drawn from Feynman's famous 1964 series of Messenger Lectures at Cornell, offers an introduction to modern physics\u2014and to Feynman at his witty and enthusiastic best. In this classic book (originally published in 1967), Feynman offers an overview of selected physical laws and gathers their common features, arguing that the importance of a physical law is not \u201chow clever we are to have found it out\u201d but \u201chow clever nature is to pay attention to it.\u201d He discusses such topics as the interaction of mathematics and physics, the principle of conservation, the puzzle of symmetry, and the process of scientific discovery. A foreword by 2004 Physics Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek updates some of Feynman's observations\u2014noting, however,\u201cthe need for these particular updates enhances rather than detracts from the book.\u201d In The Character of Physical Law, Feynman chose to grapple with issues at the forefront of physics that seemed unresolved, important, and approachable.",
                "Asymptotically free gauge theories of the strong interactions are constructed and analyzed. The reasons for doing this are recounted, including a review of renormalization-group techniques and their application to scaling phenomena. The renormalization-group equations are derived for Yang-Mills theories. The parameters that enter into the equations are calculated to lowest order and it is shown that these theories are asymptotically free. More specifically the effective coupling constant, which determines the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, vanishes for large spacelike momenta. Fermions are incorporated and the construction of realistic models is discussed. We propose that the strong interactions be mediated by a\" color\" gauge group which commutes with SU (3)\u00d7 SU (3). The problem of symmetry breaking is discussed. It appears likely that this would have a dynamical origin. It is suggested that the gauge \u2026",
                "Describes fifteen years' work which has led to the construc-tion of solutions to non-linear relativistic local field e-quations in 2 and 3 space-time dimensions. Gives proof of the existence theorem in 2 dimensions and describes many properties of the solutions.",
                "The Nobel Prize-winning physicist and bestselling author of The First Three Minutes describes the grand quest for a unifying theory of nature--one that can explain forces as different as the cohesion inside the atom and the gravitational tug between the sun and Earth. Wirting with dazzling elegance and clarity, he retraces the steps that have led modern scientists from relativity and quantum mechanics to the notion of super-strings and the idea that our universe may coexist with others. But Weinberg asks as many questions as he answers, among them: Why does each explanation of the way nature works point to other, deeper explanations? Why are the best theories not only logical but beautiful? And what implications will a final theory have for our philosophy and religious faith? Intellectually daring, rich in anecdote and aphorism, Dreams of a Final Theory launches us into a new cosmos and helps us make sense of what we find there.",
                "We identify a new cosmological problem for models which solve the strong CP puzzle with an invisible axion, unrelated to the domain wall problem. Because the axion is very weakly coupled, the energy density stored in the oscillations of the classical axion field does not dissipate rapidly; it exceeds the critical density needed to close the universe unless fa \u2a7d 1012GeV, wherefa is the axion decay constant. If this bound is saturated, axions may comprise the dark matter of the universe.",
                "Composites formed from charged particles and vortices in (2+ 1)-dimensional models, or flux tubes in three-dimensional models, can have any (fractional) angular momentum. The statistics of these objects, like their spin, interpolates continuously between the usual boson and fermion cases. How this works for two-particle quantum mechanics is discussed here.",
                "We present a short and direct derivation of Hawking radiation as a tunneling process, based on particles in a dynamical geometry. The imaginary part of the action for the classically forbidden process is related to the Boltzmann factor for emission at the Hawking temperature. Because the derivation respects conservation laws, the exact spectrum is not precisely thermal. We compare and contrast the problem of spontaneous emission of charged particles from a charged conductor.",
                "Generalizing a construction of Berry and Simon, we show that non-Abelian gauge fields arise in the adiabatic development of simple quantum mechanical systems. Characteristics of the gauge fields are related to energy splittings, which may be observable in real systems. Similar phenomena are found for suitable classical systems."
