Specific directions include supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, models of supersymmetry breaking, and string phenomenology, with an emphasis on CP violation and flavor physics, cosmological connections, electroweak symmetry breaking and extended gauge sectors, and unified models of fermion masses and mixings. Directions to room 5215, Chamberlin Hall or stairs to the 5th floor. Facing into the hallway, away from the two elevators, turn right. Follow the hallway to room 5215, which will be on your left."
